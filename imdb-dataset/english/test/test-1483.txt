<START> if this is the best commander hamilton movie i have no curiosity about the others br br a movie actor's greatest tools are his eyes but when peter stormare wants to show great emotion he closes his so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them lousy acting technique br br stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun turning his head away and his eyes shut watch carefully james bond can rest easy with competition like this br br there are some interesting supporting performances from other actors but not enough to hang a whole movie on the cinematography is good looking doing a fine job of capturing the nordic cold even the sahara winds up looking cold perhaps hamilton carries his own climate with him br br there are some individual good action sequences here unfortunately the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain which turns the hero into a big pill james bond's jokes may not be particularly good but at least he doesn't look constipated all the time br br one positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic contorted vicious hatred of israel in books has been left out what has been kept in is worship of a noble heroic plo that he shows us functioning in libya without the dictator knowledge or supervision this fantasy is hard to believe since actually threw the plo out of libya for four years at a time and at the end of the film hamilton gives the plo a very disturbing gift where will they use that gift hamilton doesn't care br br we're a long long way away from for whom the bell tolls here br br commander hamilton will remain a local phenomenon while books sell well around the world jan will never have the same success br br as for this film
<START> my taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and i have a weak spot for crazy horror slasher flicks and see no evil happens to be exactly that and more i think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a wwe film and starring kane wwe might have a big following but it's a very very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and sorry folks kind of trailer park sport and those who don't love it it it would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in droves to see see no evil doesn't break any new horror ground it's exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl they really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause there is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to it br br kane the wrestler also known as glen jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man jacob goodnight he's the ultimate cross between leatherface and jason voorhees he's not an original killer and even his kills don't really go for the unique or original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to her cell phone he does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous he stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous tiffany lamb penny samantha noble michael j pagan luke christina vidal rachael taylor all play the typical group of think they are invincible partying teens who will unwillingly become victim to the serial killer the story is that in exchange for a month off their detention sentence for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession they are sent to an old hotel to do community service by fixing it up turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he's removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins luke stands out as a scum bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his ex girlfriend who he used to beat up on the rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well but it isn't a great stretch of acting ability br br sadly porn director yes porn gregory dark does a good job putting together the modern day slasher flick he even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either in fact it's a little stale it's still interesting enough and in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killer's eyes it's interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does he throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot and the grotesque blood soaked scenes and turns everything up a notch it fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself it's entertaining kane's serial killer is horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent horror the film is being panned and crapped on and i don't blame anyone because it's pretty crappy but isn't that the point it's a horror film and i thought it was exactly what it should be it made me jump it made me cringe it even made me turn away at several parts impressive by any standards it's entertaining with a decent story and plenty of set up to see no evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and i say bring it on it's true the film is full of plot holes laughable details but the deadly gore and horror over rides it all it all comes down to do you love horror films really love them if yes then you'll think this is a terrific slasher if not you'll hate it plain and simple 8 5 10
<START> with nurse betty 2000 acclaimed indie film maker neil labute in the company of men your friends neighbors makes his breakthrough into the big budgeted betty's 24 million as opposed to company's measly 25 000 mainstream realm and yet remains true to his roots while his cast is now composed of a list hollywood names renee zellweger morgan freeman and stand up comedian chris rock his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features proving that he just may be the next big thing nurse betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years and considering its moderate box office and critical success perhaps moviegoers weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were the story follows both figuratively and literally a naive waitress zellweger who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star as good as it greg kinnear but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer aaron who made his big screen debut in company when her husband is gruesomely murdered by two freeman and rock she's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for hollywood to meet her object of affection unaware that he's only an actor when freeman and rock discover that the car she took contains 10 of cocaine they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues fans of labute's previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed in the company of men a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co worker but when you think about it the connection is rather clear in company a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of in betty a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke some might begin to wonder if labute is really some sort of misogynist himself considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women but personally i think he's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused one of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full fledged most directors when handling a script such as this one would leave the story at two chasing a woman chasing a dream but labute knows better and has one of the freeman fall obsessively for betty as well this was an interesting role for freeman to take because it allowed him to play off of his trademark this is the last time' character see unforgiven se7en and 1998's stinker hard rain the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo crispin glover back to the future allison and mad about you's kathleen the script written by first timers john c richards and james is deliriously over the top honestly have you ever seen a comedy or any movie for that matter in which a man is scalped in his own dining room you could argue that the ending is a little too perfect but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint if nurse betty is any sign of what labute has in store for us next you can bet that i'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with br br grade a
<START> sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool terrorism patriotic muslim americans and it does neither very well br br i had put off watching this show for a very long time because i had a feeling it would be too predictable but after a year in my netflix queue i finally moved it up to the front br br the show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the united states the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim so we see his conflict resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs personally i would have rather watched a drama about a muslin american family living in the united states but it is doubtful that an america tv channel cable or network will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a flattering light br br i am not a muslim but i have a lot of muslim american friends and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love america br br sleeper cell comes close to busting stereotypes of muslims but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes in the first episode we see an honor killing which is a very poor portrayal of islam but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others br br if only the moderate muslim scholar had been the main character of the show br br americans need to learn a lot more about islam sleeper cell helps a little bit but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knows br br that said the acting in this show is superb and the drama is extremely engrossing if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism it would have been first rate
<START> i really loved seeing this movie i think it's a brilliant underrated alfred hitchcock movie everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene but there's a really great movie before that robert cummings is great in what i consider to be his greatest role and the beautiful priscilla lane shows that she has a lot of talent too but i think norman lloyd gives the best performance his character fry is so evil and devious even though he's not in it for very long the movie wouldn't be the same without him br br saboteur is a great movie that every hitchcock fan should see i give it a 10 out of 10
<START> my sisters and my cousin female forced me to see this chick movie its not the kind of movie i would prefer to see but it really wasn't that bad i wouldn't want to see this movie but after watching it i couldn't say it was bad just not my kind of film it was very accurate in acting out what woman really talk about and do in certain situations as a guy i wasn't too amused by the jokes but man the women sure were they related to the movie and yeah it was funny to see themselves on the big screen oh em gee i do that to haha i've never seen the original nor would i care to if you are a girl this is a must see but maybe girls would say this movie sucked probably i don't see a 13 year old going wow i remember going threw that when i was 30 br br no man would have this in there collection but i can't say it was horrible so meh
<START> even as a big fan of the low to no budget horror genre i couldnt find this disaster mildly amusing with horrible acting a painfully generic plot and no dimensional characters no matter how bored and drunk you are this one is not worth your 81 minutes don't make the same mistake i did rent something else anything else
<START> there is not much to add to what others have already commented the movie fails hard where it shouldn't it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so unbelievable br br one thing that got me thinking was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it the guy inside the truck with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out and then get back in without being noticed by anyone because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better that they could have gotten into from there br br promising but not quite there
<START> this movie had such a good premise to start with suspense slashers a secret society and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie br br but it contained so many dumb clichÃ©s from the worst of the old american slasher horror movies now i love slasher horror movies but there are all the old clichÃ©s that have long disappeared from american cinema for example the old i hear noises in the basement and i'm home all alone and the basement light doesn't work so i'll go down to investigate clichÃ© br br three examples of these clichÃ©s just really irked me to no end br br 1 when potente finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school carving up live bodies she proceeds to ask questions and tell everyone very publicly in essence she is saying i found you out come kill me because i am telling everyone your secret and then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and is brought her severed finger in a towel br br 2 even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society disemboweling live people she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored 2 3 more times by herself at night to investigate br br 3 her roommate gets killed she gets chased by the killer whom she knows doesn't report him to the university or the police then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents then she returns to school apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let be and not try to kill her even though she knows his secret she was of course wrong br br for someone who was supposed to be so smart she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in germany she acted like the clichÃ© bimbo in a horror movie br br these things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me wish the ending would come even sooner halfway through the movie i stopped routing for her and wished that she would end up on the dissection table too
<START> okay first of all i missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie so i missed credits and stuff so when i finally got to it i was like who the hell is this dude i found out it was flex like hours after watching the movie br br flex didn't look like michael jackson not one bit he couldn't dance like him or move like him the only thing he almost had was the voice people commented on elizabeth taylor but i can't really comment on that because i don't know much about her br br the whole movie was like just plain wack the dialogue sucked the cinematography if it can be called that sucked the soundtrack sucked the acting sucked yes even flex i'm so upset about it though i didn't want it to suck i'm so sad that flex got told he can get away with it but the whole thing looked like dress up you know it's like nobody looked like they were supposed to except for joseph jackson br br the concert sequences just sucked i'm sorry but flex just can't dance like michael i mean like what the hell was vh1 thinking the makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever michael was going through for example in the movie he was still dark when neverland got raided the first time around in real life mj was white as hell there was some sort of stupid delay in his skin br br the movie wasn't boring well for me it wasn't it wasn't really anything i was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it i wanted to see how it turned out and if flex could redeem himself he didn't really the only part i found like a bit interesting was the whole lisa marie thing when they fell in love that was nice but i had to turn my face away when they kissed heh and only two parts made me collapse with laughter the first time was when they cut from michael with short hair you know the thriller era to michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era and he was still black that was funny the second time i laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of michael but they had face instead it was so funny br br overall this movie was cheap trash it was simply two hours of dress up and could have been so much better but no vh1 is cheap watch if you want but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it i came out of it feeling angry and when i found out it was flex i just started to feel so bad so watch if you want
<START> boy oh boy does this movie stink this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life please even if your life depends on it do not and i repeat do not under any circumstances view this horrid piece of garbage only watch this thing when it comes on as a mst 3000 episode that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing if i had to watch it without that show i would've stopped watching it before it was over it does have one use a cure for insomniacs
<START> i think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain or to inform if you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies sometimes these are one of the same the other side of the coin is to entertain did hitch entertain me yes it did okay the formula is standard boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls they get together have a falling out then get back together however the way it happened in this movie was refreshing i particularly liked the bar scene with hitch and sara the albert romance was a delight to watch unfold most real men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had i had hitch's advice i would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time i read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs i tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce besides relationships have there serious moments all in all i found hitch quite entertaining the actors did a good job i will be looking out for them in other movies and hitch is a film that i am very happy to have in my dvd collection
<START> i like ali g's show i believe the guy has comedic instinct but hasn't yet developed it to a talent br br the movie is a little worse than i was expecting i don't find ali g offensive just stupid jokes for 5 year olds some good some terrible br br if you want to watch a movie that seems offensive but is actually funny see tom green's 'freddy got br br 2 10
<START> was my favorite movie in the later part of the 80's when it came out my dad taped it for me i watched it all the time until my step mom taped oprah over it my heart was torn i would love to know if or where i can get it from i have been looking for it i believe they even came out w a 2 it wasn't as great as the 1st but i would like to have all of them if i could find them i do not think all that it was a bad movie it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it the actors actresses in the movie were great it also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world but it is also a woman's world many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do women deserve much respect for their duties as well
<START> i first saw this on demand or on tv i'm not really sure but this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever i mean this movie has blood gore laughs and chills through out the movie i recently ordered monster man from amazon and i've been watching monster man ever since i got it trust me you will love this movie br br p s the commentary on the dvd is way funny they also said something about monster man 2 during the commentary let's hope they make monster man 2 if you have the chance rent the movie or buy it you will absolutely love it this is the best movie that has come out in 2003 br br 10 10
