<START> a chicago couple dillon and dougherty are falsely accused of killing their daughter people begin to wonder if they did it the police investigate and find suspicious evidence the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press the cops speculate that they are satanists and have murdered their own daughter they are charged and brought to trial they are represented by publicity seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100 000 the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police fabricated of sexual abuse are presented their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed verdict she didn't do it but he did he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years br br in the last third of the movie with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple's defense witnesses admit to having lied other facts are brought to light that finally result in dillon's release the killer is never found though the movie gives us a thorough as a plausible perp br br this is a weeper from beginning to end nothing seems to go right for the couple oh there are a few happy moment maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief usually a fade to block follows there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told oh but i am fool romeo cries after killing brother here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor screaming where's my baby there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based people are either good or bad here or else they're bad then they turn good br br the film isn't aimed at exploring human quirkiness or the way things work out it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience the actors provide first rate role models i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears there are of tears showers of them of them a veritable niagara of them a lake of them br br well i'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed asner asner is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy learn to live with it which is okay and because he suffers from cancer so we can watch him take his medicine double over with pain and finally pass away br br what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises the function of gossip in private lives br br gossip is a strange thing really if we call it gossip it's bad but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable at the very least of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified as i write michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile but gossip isn't all bad either it's like water when it's properly controlled it's a community asset we need gossip to keep each other in line it helps us to maintain public order but like water in a flood or a tsunami it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control br br this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature it's done so cleverly that given its goal it's hard to argue with it
<START> this spanish italian co production tells an interesting and weird story about dr bannister a woman that not only has the best years behind her but also has a scarred face that makes her look like a freak but in madrid a professor she knows has conducted some experiments on animals with a substance which cells the experiments were successful but the animals became aggressive because the professor won't allow dr bannister to be the first human guinea pig she kills him and consumes the substance she becomes a beautiful young woman but also a vicious killer when it comes to keep her secret a secret br br the plot of the film is great fun but piero had not enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it also the film becomes boring after a good start and doesn't manage to regain a fast pace even though the film's running time doesn't exceed 83 minutes and as the setting changes to swiss city geneva for the last third of the film it sometimes even looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful geneva is which it is indeed but it doesn't help to push the plot forward so with a more talented director better actors and a bigger budget could have become an obscure italian classic but as it is it's just a lacklustre and boring crime film that isn't really worth looking for rating 3 out of 10
<START> it's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy charles bronson vehicle br br bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys he was quietly moving in the tv movie yes virginia there is a santa claus and showed a lot of class and style in the sean penn directed the indian runner br br in the evil that men do however bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists knives and of course guns there's nothing here you haven't seen in the last five death wish flicks br br wait i take that back this has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film bronson has ever had the dis service of being in not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets and jose ferrer what in blue blazes was he doing here i mean he won an oscar for crying out loud br br okay sorry about that outburst let me just say that the evil that men do has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen that was based on a book yeah that's right i wonder if it was written with bronson in mind br br no stars watch death wish instead at least it was topical
<START> with an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of todd haynes's safe 1995 david lynch uses dream myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit part hollywood actress waitress diane selwyn let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with camilla rhodes who is engaged to hotshot director adam br br the film effectively takes place in diane's drug fueled head we are witness to her crazy distortions her wish regrets obsessions and fears using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively them the last 45 minutes are as dream like as what came before and the troublesome air of detached otherworldly ambiguity still pervades fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams br br lynch's film borrows from many films old and new but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own lost highway and blue velvet it constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen not only intuitively but intellectually yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds an element that was missing in all of his other films except the straight story he does this by presenting diane's dream alter ego betty as a wholesome canadian farm girl destined for fame lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure are camilla and diane really lovers or just friends who is the blue lady what does she signify who is the bum behind what is the significance of the rotting corpse at sierra bonita does aunt ruth really exist is an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self referential take on the film's status as fiction lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses choosing instead to present his love story in the city of dreams as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs br br the acting is top rate especially naomi watts as diane selwyn betty who is yet to eclipse this performance laura has the requisite allure as camilla rita while adam theroux as adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role it was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an academy award br br this is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely the mystery at the heart of the film remains in lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary of narrative coherence ultimately this is lynch's key film
<START> diane keaton is a pathetic actress she is so boring and phony she is the same on and off screen i saw her in an interview with ellen degeneres and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels she has been in a couple of good movies but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part steve martin doesn't add much to the movie either he over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite the ridiculous part martin short plays only adds more idiocies to the movie i've tried to watch the movie twice but both times had to turn it off
<START> i was invited to view this film at a small art museum screening i had no clue what to expect i was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see judd nelson bill paxton wayne newton james cann rob lowe and lara flynn boyle listed however after some very disturbing grossed out scenes that did not add much to the story advancement this film quickly became a weapon of torture the gimmick of the vestigial growing arm storyline is never really developed i patiently kept waiting for this film to cash in there was a small payoff in the end but having to invest and sit through the the endless gross crude sexually perverted in your face screaming unfunny gore cost too much for me even for a free viewing what were these established actors doing in this awful film the art direction was very convincing and creepy at the very minimum it should only be a 75 minute film this is a film that dick cheney and donald rumsfeld would embrace
<START> x is a beautiful adaption of herman melville's or the the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction br br the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion the story is of downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic br br i can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the half hour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with 1 000 thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling i know i'm gushing here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film it's the best i've seen all year
<START> i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it's being able to make those clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' in fires in the mirror br br pieces like decalogue v used to intimidate me i felt that if i accepted them than i would be compromising something what i thought before really isn't worth getting into i understand what naturalism is trying to say i experienced a tangible and one that fell into existence piecemeal and one that's still alive that i still have to reckon with it's still working inside me br br the film wasn't sympathetic per se it doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing there are certainly wicked people whether or not they should die is for another film what decalogue shows is that good beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up br br the of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate decalogue v it's not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before but i see now the worth in making art like this to people or perhaps to make people do something br br there's a method to compromise of his light much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect this should not be too strange of an idea after all how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect i wince when i say it but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when i have the power to say to myself 'this ruin this process this natural process makes me want to buck the system ' br br i do not think naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods instead i think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments that we are of course free to ignore we can ignore it all we want if we want to give the more corpses to bury br br for surely despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters' likely and catastrophic fate they are impassioned by inaction and i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what's to be done with what they see as has been mentioned there's danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone there's danger in the hopeful disparaging the natural because it doesn't correspond to their world view br br and i don't think that the need be either wealthy or fortunate i have not seen it but it seems that the film american beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort there are as well as as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is who grieve because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape br br landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed but in reality landscapes do not enact they change sure and dramatically but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over but it cannot be changed itself
<START> i am a new convert you might as well say i borrowed the dvds from my local library i have been interested in samurai since watching 'the last samurai ' my dad told me he used to watch shintaro when he was a kid he said that it was pretty good we are up to series 3 i absolutely love it it takes a little to get used to the dubbed english voices over the characters speaking japanese but i really enjoy it all the same it is a little strange to watch the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick into a tree or wall i was not used to this but i am now but i suppose that's the technology they had in the 60s i've noticed that shintaro is kind friendly willing to help those in need he's very humble most of the time he doesn't big note himself he only says he is better than the enemy ninja i admire shintaro for these qualities it's really interesting to watch the swordsmanship that koichi has it is amazing this series is for anyone who are interested in samurai
<START> this movie had very few moments of real drama after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back viewing was pure purgatory to say the least the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn't stop laughing the continuity between some of the scenes was dire characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else surely this was a spoof of the exorcist the collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day mr russo signed up for this one do i speak latin et tu brutus
<START> this was okay but really a bit disappointing because i expected more laughs considering the storyline and the lead actor bill murray it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be only part of this made me really laugh such as when murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle you have to see it to appreciate it br br the supporting cast was anything but likable people just look at a sampling of the names matthew mcconaughey janeane garofalo and linda fiorentino yecch mcconaughey's role in here as tip tucker was just downright annoying he was the worst br br other that those people the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended it's another disney flop
<START> about your terrible movie copying beethoven as a professional musician it's my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and beethoven is one of my favorites when hungarians and americans meet it's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible you proved it in your terrible b movie the only thing that carries the movie is the music of course you didn't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the quartet but ok i have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you've made it starts of with the dying deaf beethoven who perfectly understands anna who is merely whispering beethoven's hearing during the movie get's better by the minute but that must be because of some vague divine thing then there is the quite impossible semi pornographic eyes wide shut double conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious anna and the crying nephew in the end who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes my god what a performance and as culmination the rip off from amadeus with beethoven dictating music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense which she understands perfectly but no one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least but i can assure you that beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason this so called homage is blasphemy and i am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it's about my favorite subject ed harris and others you cannot comprehend the greatness of beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing that's the trouble with you americans you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work yeah we can do it anyway remember that a good product comes with hard labor talent devotion and professionalism all these you creators of copying beethoven lack see you in kindergarten
<START> this dvd set is the complete widescreen 15 episode run of surface a television show made by universal in 2006 the full running time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus a few bonus features deleted scenes cast interviews special effects featurette this was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects br br unfortunately 10 hours is a lot of time and as typically happens with this type of stuff the overall quality begins to fall off in the later episodes i found the first 7 episodes discs 1 and 2 extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment surface was produced written and directed by josh and jonas pate and it appears that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to together enough good subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes it even looks like additional writers were brought in for the later episodes because the characters who were already the weakest part of the series lack consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes the series was canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of sorts there are still a lot of things left hanging br br it is basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons sort of a television blend of jurassic park and et the story begins as a puzzle as a crew less navy sub is found adrift at sea boaters on a texas lake are sucked into whirlpool a lighthouse in africa is destroyed by a huge monster etc etc and as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense a human element is introduced in the form of three american families one on each coast and one on the gulf of mexico laura lake bell is a california marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from an undersea thermal vent on the ocean floor rich connelly jay r ferguson is diving with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother away never to be seen again br br miles bennett carter jenkins is a wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean he takes one home where it hatches into an et type dragon he will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from the local authorities these dragons may look like lizards but they are more like indestructible electric eels firing electromagnetic pulses causing lightning strikes emptying the sea of fish and reproducing like a bunch of randy rabbits when they find an undersea thermal vent of boiling water as long as it's uncertain whether or not they're intelligent extraterrestrial or harmless the premise is interesting once you begin to suspect their origin it all gets very tired and predictable br br jay r ferguson a staggeringly bad actor in the tradition of david hasselhoff essentially plays the richard dreyfuss character from close encounters of the third kind so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character you will grow to hate this character more with each episode unfortunately what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two as ferguson and bell a low budget version of sandra bullock are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as improbable as the stuff jason bourne gets himself into you expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show that can even be part of the fun but their adventures are not just totally implausible they are utterly and completely boring there are three consecutive episodes that feature ferguson and bell together in a that will have you longing for the excitement of an all day conference br br jenkins miles is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon are inter cut often enough with the boring ferguson bell stuff to keep you watching and these segments benefit from the presence of gorgeous leighton of recent gossip girl fame as his sister savannah apparently the producers picked up on the importance of this to their teenage boy target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce caitlin as a first love interest for miles so as screen time decreases is gradually phased in br br in retrospect they needed a third storyline to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> if you are an insomniac and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie if you are renting it for whatever other reason dont this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason i cant even write about this movie anymore get it away from me
<START> i watched the first 10 minutes of this show i think i'm gonna barf now one worst shows on tv it's not even funny it's so lame it's disgusting i gave it a second and third change couldn't even make it through five minutes don't waste the time this is one of the many shows that need to go bye bye speaking of regular night time shows that need to go all the shows on cbs all the shows on abc all the shows on fox and joe buck all the shows on the new cw network all the shows on nbc accept the law and order series all the morning and afternoon talk shows all the court tv shows and every reality show out there every stupid game show period the end all the home improvement shows and all the media news all it is is a 24 hour loop of bad news yes i do have favorites monk the law orders thats it for me
