<START> obviously can be seen as just not another stupid animated movie that a studio might put out to simply survive it is far from it and it can be easily described as a captivating beautiful movie experience br br miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece now to many this has been said to be the least of his achievements in film making due to in part of his certain weirdness factor not being there that is true the morals and insights that are not quite so evident in his previous films are very up front in this picture is not too difficult to understand or comprehend his idea i believe was to make a children's movie that was just as suitable for adults as their kids and for it not to be too complicated he accomplished this perfectly and he also didn't lose any substance along the way which is the reason it gets a 10 br br besides that the film itself is so engrossing from the start and the way its presented is so beautiful it left me in awe at times because i remembered how they were all hand drawn by miyazaki himself i haven't been so enlightened and happy after seeing a film since i saw once a while back another film not to be missed everything about was absolutely stunning and breathtaking even the music for it was pure perfection the only bad thing i have to say about it was its english dubbing don't get me wrong they were good too but i had seen about 2 weeks before it came out nationally and i believed that in some parts i wish it had kept some of its japanese dialogue not all of it though did enjoy the english way too all in all everyone should see it's absolutely flawless and in another league of film making altogether finally and don't hold me to this but i wouldn't be surprised if got a best picture nomination as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it it's just that good
<START> a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free but the cost is the life of someone they've never met this is a very tedious film to watch richard kelly who wrote and directed it decided to make a film without any payoff you are taken on a ride of slow build ups one after the other with minor revelations at best at certain moments i thought to myself this will have major significance at the end but nothing does the film just leaves one thinking this story could have been told in 30 minutes without all the stretched out nonsense i will hope you avoid this god awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so
<START> return to was a hard film to track down well i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while wish it was kept that way first sam hell is of course not roddy piper he is replaced by a dude with a large face less charisma and this poor actor is very soft spoken for the part sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome here he gets captured three times what kind of a hero is that is replaced as well here by another actress why did we not get different characters here this was stupid lou ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero common sense says let lou be the hero of the film bad effects poor acting and just a forgettable film funny as they take shots at ninja turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie at least ninja turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie i really wanted to like return to but i just cringed when the fight scenes would commence this film makes turtles 3 look like gold avoid this or you will be the one singing meaner greener talking turtle tv dinner
<START> i have seen previous movies from cÃ©dric and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth having been an erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time yes it is great fun because of that i thought i should not miss this movie unfortunately i was disappointed to find that fails to satisfy in many ways the characters are stereotyped the events are trite and the story is shallow although there are quite a few familiar situations they are irritatingly clichÃ© and do not go beyond the trivial events this made the movie uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong been there done that don't you have anything to add feeling apart from that the movie lacks a firm story it sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real life' show than a seriously made movie br br however i can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad this might be fun to watch
<START> i am in a vast minority here i also didn't much care for the original caddyshack aside from the chase murray duo scene and select rodney jokes okay break it down rodney vs jackie both jewish and have similar humor rodney's a bigger name and more distinct jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to his jokes and is more yours' in this sequel jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way inspirational his quick lines and over confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way rodney was good but there wasn't enough of him and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive jackie in a rare film appearance makes a perfect sub for rodney come on a gun shaped hair dryer really look at the little things br br stack vs knight both play snobby yuppies very well ted knight despite his wonderful tv film career kinda shows his age but he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying playing his anger and frustration too slapstick while stack is more incidentally snide and vengeful you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail stack wins with me br br murray vs aykroyd well both had great vintage snl like scenes with the ever present and enjoyable chevy chase ty webb i did like the murray chase one better murray plays his great annoying chatty character with obvious improv skill and is loveable yet annoying and the exact same can be said for aykroyd both get annoying after a while but it's a tie br br i really loved part 2 over the first they are 2 totally different films part one is more drug bathroom sex humor with a cast full of great names part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a it to the rich' type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class 80s script yes a bit far fetched yes but wasn't the first an insult to the sport of golf yes it's a movie thin story yes it's a comedy with actual humor not with besides part 2 has a much better soundtrack please don't expect this to be a sequel to part one it is 98 its own movie and shouldn't even have the name in it that said i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor viva jackie mason to all the lighten up it's a great comedy of its own randy quaid was wonderful jonathan silverman was wonderful heck everyone was all this chatting and now i feel like watching it i think i will
<START> this looks like one of these australian movies done by talented students and funded by the government it is chock full of smart shots of colors and shapes and verbal excursions into freudian psychology to be appreciated by art students and teachers alike but in general it is perceived a stupid mockery of good cinema good storytelling and generally good taste this what happens i guess when art students become so obsessively indulgent pink flamingoes is miles ahead one the same subjects some porn movies from 70s are far more watchable and inspiring book of revelation is not entirely without merits but as an overall experience it is well below average b grade
<START> don't get me wrong i love the tv series of league of gentlemen it was funny twisted and completely inspired i was looking forward to the movie the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them br br it was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters why not pick mickey pauline papa or tubs and edward for the main parts it was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humour br br the real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny the direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take very rushed br br then the three headed plasticine esquire monster what the hell was all that about plain ridiculous it felt like the league of gentlemen tagged it on at the end br br all in all i found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film br br if i could give it 0 out of 10 i would do not waste your money seeing this
<START> i couldn't stop laughing i caught this again on late night tv i suppose you think you're some kind of hero for bringing my daughter back alive no good br br haha
<START> utterly useless having been there done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect it may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire unrealistic drivel so many cringe worthy scenes that would put the office to shame not a compliment to this film it also may have helped to have some semblance of a story a point a message a commentary anything seriously kevin perry go large had more to say on the subject than this film term used very loosely in this case there should be minus numbers reserved for films like this 10 extra turd
<START> what a bad movie the premise was all there the actors were all there and yet a believable plot good dialogue characters to relate to were somewhat missing br br typical heist gone wrong premise set against a backdrop of everyman being shafted by the system the lead character and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be repossessed along comes godfather matt dillon who does not look much older than so not exactly sure how that happened to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armoured van which they work on as security guards has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it and thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 minutes of unbelievable trash i will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major ones br br because of deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage all of his close friends including his godfather die his godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money the money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house and yet he chose it over the supposed family of matt dillon br br there are many more needless to say that this film was tripe and i earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it
<START> a friend of mine showed me this film yesterday and i was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible br br mix the most awful clichÃ©d dialog with the most wooden acting you've ever seen with the cheesiest special effects know to man and you get this magnificent beast br br assassins' is funnier than most comedies i've seen it really is awful br br i was in stitches during the scene where the ex cop vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist just watch it and you'll see what i mean br br i honestly can't believe that someone made this with serious intentions br br tragic but a really good laugh it has to be seen to be believed
<START> randy bowers john wayne comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to ed rogers proprietor of the establishment he's observed by the dead man's niece sally alberta vaughn from behind a hidden room where she remained unobserved during the carnage br br randy rides alone was directed by harry fraser he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films where he fast forwards the action from one location to another usually involving a rider on a horse it's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era lone star westerns br br pre gabby george hayes is on hand sans whiskers and this is the first time i've seen him as a villain in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role first as hunchbacked businessman matt the mute communicating via pencil and paper only to turn into marvin black leader of a gang of outlaws black's gang was responsible for the murders at half way house in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt marvin another staple player is here as well yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike interestingly yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser wayne oater the arizona skies br br there's a fair amount of time killing horseback riding back and forth between black's gang and the sheriff's posse as john wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys in the end he saves the day by securing sally rogers' thirty thousand dollars at the expense of destroying the half way house where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six shooter and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain in his best aw shucks attitude john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers and alas randy rides alone no more
<START> i found the movie at my local video store and i was surprised to see it on dvd i had heard about the explicit sex scenes gruesome violence and the notorious debauchery i sat and watched and i began laughing the set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written the incestuous relationship between caligola malcolm mcdowell and his serenely beautiful sister drusilla theresa ann a vulnerable beauty can't be taken seriously it's not even shocking or repulsive peter o'toole and john were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film the cinematography was a joke and i was even more amused when they used a quote from the bible the book of mark no less if you are looking for shock value this movie will disappoint you if you are looking for camp cult value you will be even more disappointed i know i was i have seen shocking and this is two hours of your life you will never have back
<START> an art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from trees and puts it in his apartment but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people br br this beautifully crafted well actually it's more fantasy romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life problem was that i spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button it sure would have sped up the film's slow pacing but then again i wouldn't know about too much that was going on which was reasonably hard to figure out or keep interest in the first place the performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain dull and that's probably because these characters are unconvincing stale and coma inducing the actual back story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messily put together with too much focus on a flimsy romance being laughable when it shouldn't be and overall it's constructed in an ordinary manner that just lacks the oomph or conviction to carry the film what compensates for the story's shortcomings are really arty images which looked grand but the use of some images had me somewhat dumbfounded to what they actually mean towards the film what catches your eye is the faded colour scheme but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy or snowy although from that it shows the raw intensity of the production but also add some nice polished effects that goes well with the soothing but sometimes edgy score the camera work was pretty diverse although it didn't add too much to the feature but during some of the more upbeat scenes there were too many close ups or dark lighting which made it hard to understand what you are seeing also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore but not overtly grand or distinguishable from most other films br br lethargically odd film with luminous images that look like something out of a painting but still it isn't particularly enticing watch out it might put you in a deep trance
<START> i was rather appalled to see the low rating this movie received here personally considering it fun family fare it revolves around a young teenager sandy who is sent by his mom to coral key to spend the summer with his uncle porter while there he befriends a dolphin named flipper lots of adventures ensue amid the predictable nephew uncle bonding as well as a little romance for sandy with a local girl br br i'm a great crocodile dundee fan myself so absolutely loved paul hogan in his role as crusty and comical uncle porter for starters he keeps an endless stock of spaghetti in his house to serve as his usual meal heated with a blowtorch elija wood frodo from the lord of the rings appeared quite competent playing the young sandy a boy at first none too fond of his forced summer vacation locale br br of course the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes set in the florida keys it was apparently filmed in the bahamas this adaptation of flipper makes great family entertainment a sweet sentimental and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the cinematic offerings for youngsters nowadays
