<START> this move is bad on so many levels i don't even know where to start ok the good points peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather some of the landscape photography was stunning that's about it oh and it was a nice touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in i figure it was a nod to the buffalo soldiers the movie starts sort of ok but the characters are so flat so comic book so the bad guys are just over the top bad i choke trying to describe them further the spanish cuban american war was 1895 1898 with america being involved only in april to august of '98 i think the movie said it took place in 1893 i could be wrong but i don't want to look at it again to check a big part of this movie hinged on the kkk killing jessie's daddy well boys the original kkk started in 1865 and was destroyed by president andrew johnson in 1871 the klan wasn't even around during the time period of this movie of course the nasty bas got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that but for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot i think i could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and i'm done i didn't know that and other bands like that got their inspiration from new orleans street singers from the 1890's i also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for sioux women in the 1890's but then i was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing 1 nails we just about died laughing and i like a cheesy western more than most people do such a waste of talent and money this really had the chance to show a part of american history that isn't well known http www coax net people htm for some more information this could have been so good but it was just bad from 1 10 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because mario looks good in his hat and there was an appaloosa horse in the film
<START> who the heck had the bright idea of casting lucille ball in this film it should have been angela lansbury's baby all the way at the very least lucy should have had her singing dubbed br br there is some compensation in the fact that jerry herman's score is pretty well kept intact except for that's how young i feel and we do get performances by the original broadway cast members jane and bea arthur br br i suppose robert preston had to be given a song hence the inferior loving you br br overall i think in this one the wrong redhead was cast
<START> a horrible horrible horrible film i saw the original when i was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens when i found out a remake was on the way i groaned why oh why remake a good film well we can thank dark castle for yet another classic horror film this time they've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore slower than slow pacing and yawn inspired characters someone previously said that s he was surprised that paris hilton can act uh were you watching the film she plays a prissy little tramp sounds like typecasting to me half of the people in the audience actually cheered when she died that tells you why people are seeing this film if that's your only reason then find a better one because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want had i been alone i would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition this thing is like a moron's guide to crap film making in bred southern git stupid but attractive leads knives a plenty gore a plenty stock menacing truck i could go on after watching this film i began to really appreciate jeepers creepers and i thought that film sucked save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost
<START> i just saw checking out at the philadelphia film festival what a terrific combination of a heartwarming storyline and a great cast director jeff hare has done an outstanding job of inviting the audience into the disjointed yet hilarious world of morris and family the family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics yet feel the real pain and concern they have for one another br br typically i am not a peter falk fan but he is morris and plays the role with great humor and humanity br br i hope that everyone gets to see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as i did br br hats off to the director cast and crew for a job well done
<START> john voight plays the title character in this movie based on author pat conroy's prince of tides autobiography a fine teacher film it tells the story of a naive pat conroy a young english teacher whose first assignment is in an elementary school on a rural island the only white man on the island he must battle internal and external pressures as he attempts to instill education and values in children who for generations have been systematically denied such things a solid performance that really makes you think
<START> ram gopal verma usually makes so so cookie cutter formula fare lifted from some hollywood flick his every film after shiva is in the cookie cutter genre occasionally he makes a truly horrible movie like this one br br for the first 55 minutes we are introduced to the only 2 characters a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer go figure and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in bollywood they fall in love zero becomes hero dancer gymnast gets no break gymnastics angst the usual heartbreak more gymnastics angst song dance angst some more gymnastics more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it you're fast asleep and this despite the hot sexy hot hot sexy hot bod of the leading lady cum gymnast cum dancer br br but hey you're not alone the editor director photographer in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru out the entire production only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap so you lose ha joke's on you don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise wear puh leese when will the poor thang get a break she's starr br br cannot act rgv's lost his marbles abhishek tried hard but failed no plot no story nothing she must've paid rgv handsomely to make this all nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch what a super deal no need for an acting career br br such absolute rubbish can only be made in bollywood of course
<START> if i rate the film maybe a bit high you can blame it on sentiment this is one of the first movies that i remember seeing and totally loving i saw it at the drive ins here in california in the late 70s i was already a big fan of the muppet show on tv so i was primed for the movie and the movie did not disappoint basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie kermit the frog is on a quest to become famous not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet but because he wants to make millions of people happy of course br br along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends most endearingly fonzie bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand up they sing movin' right along a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery he also encounters enough hollywood movie stars to fill a stanley kramer movie including comedy luminaries like richard pryor steve martin edgar bergen milton berle and mel brooks brooks in particular has a rather dull bit and you are left feeling that henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasn't afraid of offending the stars anyway as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is dom deluise br br the ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any children's movie the hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them when a real rainbow pierces the hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery i'm sure this was meant to relate to some of jim henson's own personal or spiritual experiences br br this is the best movie with muppets by a long shot if you or anyone else was wondering why the muppets were so popular back in the 70s considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades i think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue
<START> for the most part i only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past this movie is pure escapism the dancing starts almost immediately and debra paget in her purple harem bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion her dancing while sultry is surpassed by her dance in fritz lang's tiger of available on dvd where she played the temple dancer br br one problem with the movie is the closed setting there are few outdoor scenes shot and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic the same locations are used over and over again but with some interesting secret passages and her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that magnitude debra even wields a sabre and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a staircase she could do it all br br what does work is debra paget as a princess with her beauty she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history this movie when hopefully it becomes available on dvd will be a must buy overall taken with a bit of humor i loved it br br
<START> calling this film a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is far too optimistic heck you can't even refer to it as a nice spoof of the genre because it's way below average it's funny but not haha funny you know but still i'd say to give it a look if only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it by the way all those people who're complaining about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame when you see the dvd cover of this film you should already know that it's not going to be on the same level as the piano for example so don't come complaining afterwards br br evil ed could've been something but the totally screwed it up i suppose the main idea behind this film is criticism towards the growing 'cutting in horror nowadays it shows an editor named edward who's slowly well not too slowly going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company produced the big boss is named sam campbell funny isn't it personally i also expected a character named bruce raimi but to my surprise there wasn't anyway this guy became rich by making movies called loose limbs they feature and i'm not kidding you scenes in which a girl is getting raped by a beaver and then gets shot in the head by a bazooka now who says horror isn't original anymore br br with all the gore and the it's hard to believe it but it really gets boring very quick after a decent first 25 minutes evil ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from that the only think left to do then besides pushing the eject button of course is look for the obvious amount of references to other much better horror films i saw scenes obviously stolen from the evil dead silence of the lambs braindead and several others and there's a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well br br evil ed finds it origin in sweden i'm convinced there's a lot up talent there far north take the danish as an example but none of them talents joined the cast or crew of evil ed only to see if you're in a dumb mood and you don't want to use your brain at all
<START> is one of the worst films direct to video films that i see ever br br i am not amazing that this product does not appearing at the cinema bad visual effects the start is dreadful bad actors i donÂ´t understand why appear in this film the great dennis hopper and bad screen without sense my alternative or twister sentence for do not watch this film
<START> well anne is way way too old wentworth looks younger than she and he should not louisa is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty she is supposed to be average not pretty when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a complainer lady russell is too old this is crazy if you read the novel she is anne's older more mature friend maybe as old as mother would be which would be around 18 20 years older than anne so around 50 not 70 its crazy doesn't fit how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning she smiles when she says oh the worst is over i've seen him now the worst has passed yeah right ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger michell version than you cant compare these two that one is right on this one is way off read the novel and you'll know what i mean
<START> this film says everything there is to say about religion i wish it were required viewing for all bigots and would be br br the story set in a turn of the century danish villages is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and exploring the world and its many beauty they are now old and their life and beauty spent their quiet new help whom they teach to cook is babette played by the lovely stephane who graced so many of her husband claude chabrol's films the life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that br br when babette wins the lottery she requests a chance to prepare a feast a true labour of love the course of the feast and its chief guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love god and life br br this is a must see for the devotion with which babette prepares the feast and for the speech the general gives at the end possibly the best international film of the 1980's
<START> this is one of the best episodes from the entire x files series creepy beyond words the tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie this episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as home humbug bad blood and for being the best in their respective season br br mulder and growing relationship is put to the test in this episode can they really trust each other this episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling br br mulder bring your
<START> the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10 i mean everything is flawless for me in this motion picture i saw it almost a year ago and yet i remember many of the scenes especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits br br the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline making the film perfect br br the message is clear friendship and it's displayed throughout the whole thing br br i have nothing more to say here simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film and of course it's fun and moving at the same time suiting people of any age br br 10 10 nicely done
<START> this film which i rented under the title black voodoo should be avoided i was expecting a blaxploitation horror flick but what i got was a very dull standard ghost extracts in this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment but who's plea was ignored and he died in an operation the result his spirit nurse sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder the only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters in this case a blinded ex football player who's mom practiced voodoo the film is very slow and very dull there is a very standard ending that provides on excitement followed by a horrificly stupid ending warning spoiler br br in which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed this movie is slow and bad in a non funny just stupefying way avoid it at all costs
