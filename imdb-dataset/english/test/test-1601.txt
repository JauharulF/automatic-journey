<START> hadnt heard a lot about this movie except it being national award and oscar entry its a marathi movie n i cant make out apple from orange in marathi but when i saw the movie playing on late sunday night i just got glued now i am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills but i have watched a good number of movies of various genres and for an average viewer i will highly recommend this movie the feel is very earthy and realistic though there are some melodramatic moments watch it to feel human lately haven't seen any movie which touches heart especially in hindi cinema the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home the camera moves around to reveal the kid wearing black glasses having lost his eyes the kid hears the other kids splashing in the water and starts clapping i was awestruck and the two hours i spent watching the movie very much worth it
<START> the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events and i've been a wrestling fan for a good few years now the other shows may have better matches but i've always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement br br i'm not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don't see it as fair to ruin the results on a review i will comment on the quality of them though br br we have the standard 4 matches and then the big rumble event two from smackdown and two from raw br br shawn michaels and edge open up for raw this proves to be a good match from two talented guys this is a match i'd recommend watching it's hard to sum up without giving away the winner br br next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is giant gonzales yokozuna kamala well this time it's its also a casket match typical undertaker fare watch if you're a fan i have to admit i am purely for the entertainment factor it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match br br the next two matches are the title matches for once smackdown manages to upstage raw their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with a anti climax and let down to end it raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved br br now to the main reason i love the event the rumble it's a pretty good one this year coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated there is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant it has its usual highs and lows and i loved the ending in particular the vince mcmahon entrance br br i'd recommend this show not the wwe on top form but its still good add it to your collection
<START> story of an ex navy seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art russian sub with a nurse this is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew the sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction so we see the duo try and gain control back and this happens with the fear of the us naval forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie a couple of unexplained scenes towards the end watch it when you have the time nothing to miss out even if you let the show run while you go get yourself a cup of coffee slow moving
<START> can a film be too faithful to the book upon which it is based judging from the time spanning 2007 adaptation of huge 2003 seller the answer is rather ironically yes like many i was enthralled by the book an impressive first effort by the afghan american writer physician so obviously were director marc forster stranger than fiction and screenwriter david troy who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story within the film's 127 minute running time yet the seamless tapestry of heartfelt events in novel often comes across as episodic and truncated because forster and are sincerely trying hard to remain true to the full scope of the story within the time constraints part of the challenge is how carefully used symbolic acts to provide literary then and now symmetry to what is essentially a three act story a technique that can come across as somewhat contrived on screen br br however the filmmakers do the most important things right specifically giving the viewer an intimate look into a hidden culture heretofore conveyed through cnn news reports ensuring authenticity by having characters speak in the dari persian dialect of the afghan language and capturing the emotional entanglements of the complex narrative the first part of the movie is set in 1978 afghanistan before the soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the taliban the focus is on the relationship between amir the son of an affluent businessman named baba and the devoted hassan the son of his father's servant connected by their mutual love of kite running the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to his father amir is crippled by guilt for not having rescued hassan from an unspeakable act performed by a trio of local bullies forster makes especially palpable the ethnic tensions between the and the in afghanistan br br upon the 1979 invasion by soviet troops amir and baba flee to the u s where the story picks up their story nine years later in california a suburban enclave of afghan Ã©migrÃ©s baba is reduced to working in a gas station and operating a flea market kiosk amir meets a local afghan girl and marries this is the film's least interesting passage since treatment gives short shrift to ancillary characters like wife and most critically amir is portrayed by necessity as a reticent young man with a downward cast toward his self esteem the final section flashes forward twelve years where amir upon publication of his first book is summoned back to taliban dictated afghanistan to rescue hassan's son from the taliban as a means to atone for his cowardice years earlier there is true suspense and fear generated in this portion of the story as shocking revelations and old acquaintances come back to haunt amir during his journey br br a british actor of egyptian heritage the lead hijacker in united 93 has the central role of amir as an adult a challenging role since he has to convey a constant sense of shame and diminished self worth until the end the other professional actors fare better shaun tony savior in the current iron man as business partner khan who holds the key to the truth leoni quietly affecting as and best of all iranian actor who brings pride and dignity to baba three young non professionals were recruited from school system to play the key child roles and all are quite good is up to the challenge of the toughest part as young amir and ali danish bakhtyari is poignant as hassan's nearly catatonic son but it's the sad eyed moon faced ahmad khan who will break your heart as the young hassan especially in the devastating pomegranate throwing scene it's fair to say his performance is on par with the young enzo in vittorio de sica's classic bicycle thieves br br the technical aspects are well done in particular roberto clean cinematography western china convincingly substitutes for afghanistan alberto evocative score and even the cgi effects showcasing the kites in turbulent flight the 2008 dvd has a solid set of extras beginning with an insightful commentary from forster and although some of their dialogue seems rather forced there are two featurettes included the first is the 14 minute words from the kite runner which focuses on connection to the story and the development of the novel and the second is the 25 minute images from the kite runner a more standard behind the scenes look at the production rounding out the extras are the original theatrical trailer a few previews and a psa from on how to help the afghans during their current time of need
<START> just watched hair after a lapse of 20 years it struck home for those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power who resisted the fascism of the johnson nixon administrations who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in vietnam every single day until finally the us beast died and fled for all who said no in many different ways it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were how large the real table was on which treat danced how driven the wizard behind the curtain we were 20 22 24 we didn't know the nature of the enemy the size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world how could we even with smoke and the bat the bat in our hand like treat we were too young too middle class too invested too much a part of the actions we hated br br but there was a moment as andre gregory observes in my dinner with there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60's and early 70's when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road something not fueled by prisons enron and dick something collaborative something innocent and critical at once something with dance br br but we missed it like kong bending a the revolution was turned in on itself into sexism racism homophobia and class crushing politics until we got to w treat would have hated w and iraq and the pathological lies if they were in that film then but the moment passed and w was almost inevitable comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken raging bull into children's lives and china shops br br we should have done something more something better but we clearly didn't know what br br now what
<START> and i bought a vampire motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his tied together some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable like norman j warren's some 'bad' films are just bad like kent headless eyes but 'bad' films that try and do the post modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution a lot of people think troma's terror firmer is a bad taste masterpiece for example but i'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck then there's john carpenter's dark star yes it's quaint and certainly a product of its time but as a film it's only two notches above worthless this no budget british black comedy horror outing tries to achieve a satirical tone with its endless references to its fellow shoestring splatter flicks among them psychomania horror hospital and pretty much anything by pete walker but due to dismal performances by second string tv actors the leading lady looks like amy a script that appears to have been written on the back of a peeled beermat by two with no understanding of how film comedy works dean intentionally dire elevator rock soundtrack and production values never rising above mediocre the net result is a film that can only be laughed at rather than with if your idea of whoopee is anthropomorphic turds chinese called fu king and references to long forgotten tv ads you'll enjoy this one but don't expect too much
<START> this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen br br normally i don't write reviews but i was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made judging by the trailer we were not disappointed in the least its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line br br brandon i just want to get to know you br br girl you just want to get into my pants br br brandon i want to get into your mind your heart your soul i don't see you wearing any pants in this equation br br overall i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously
<START> i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous the scenery is ponderous and gaudy the acting for the most part is terrible i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie john gielgud brief his appearance in the movie still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played macro was handsome the guy who played claudius looked more like the traditional depictions of nero and was certainly at odds with robert graves' picture of claudius the climactic assassination of caligula wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open air area when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the hill which ran along the front of the that still exists today there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it merciful distractions if you want history read or if you want pornography and sadism watch salo but by all means stay away from this movie
<START> i've read other reviews of this movie and while it certainly isn't the best movie ever made in the sci fi horror genre it isn't that bad if you accept it for what it is low budget b movie fare that shall we say borrows heavily from the likes of 'alien' nasty extraterrestrial monster that cocoons its victims gorgeous and confused space girl and the beastie breeding with captive girls angle this is one seriously cheesy movie and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget although the alien isn't too bad i've seen far less convincing men in rubber suits at any rate none of the acting is oscar material and the isle of man doesn't really double for boston very convincingly the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel squillions of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an all girls college campus thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims is utterly laughable however the movie does have its suspenseful moments there's a few helpings of nudity and semi nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model actress simmons as the space girl who at the age of only 24 was murdered in london by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film
<START> tony curtis and skip both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up must have been too hard on the young stars feet if the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots in the first scenes they took off their just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer when they went to the area where they dug the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots then later when lovejoy and curtis run into the and his daughter tony is wearing the tennis shoes but hey have been the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest
<START> a malfunction in space sends astronaut neil stryker glenn corbett off course and headed to something of a parallel world called terra circling the sun exactly opposite earth as a being from space would pose a threat to this world's order stryker is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him stryker however gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes with the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who opposes the government stryker will try to board a spaceship and head back to earth br br stranded in space or the stranger if you prefer is another of those 70s made for tv movies that was to be turned into a regular weekly show in this case it's easy to see why it didn't make it first off there's nothing new about the show's set up it was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by the fugitive or the incredible hulk or planet of the apes you know a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter it's a formula that's been done to death the second strike against stranded in space is its lead glenn corbett could this guy come across any less likable i was rooting for him to get caught without sympathy for the main character this kind of show would never work finally this is supposed to be science fiction just because everyone is left handed and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon i'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet so it's a mere coincidence that they all speak english dress just like people on earth and drive plymouth furies yeah right br br the lone highlight for me was the inclusion of cameron mitchell in the cast sure it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful but you know the old saying any cameron is better than no cameron yeah i've never heard it either br br as with a lot of these 70s made for tv movies i watched stranded in space courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 i wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination but there are a few good jokes along the way so in the end while i rate the movie a 2 10 it gets a 3 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> i bought my first album in 1974 at 17 and have been hooked ever since this dvd has now taken pride of place in my music collection it is not often that a band can boast 4 in their lineup but here we can each member made their own contribution to the band but on the stage together the electricity they generated was bigger than the 4 individuals this masterpiece covers the band's entire career from led 1 to coda and this is captured magnificently on this dvd as each concert shows how the band became bigger and bigger over the years recently my copy disappeared but i'm happy to say was found in my son's room as the new generation discover just how great these guys were this is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music long live led zeppelin
<START> a good story about rusty parker rita hayworth who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny gene kelly and genius phil silvers rusty is in love with danny all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl they never eat them the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing the movie has two questions that rusty must answer is fame all that it is cracked up to be and is less really more if you are happy answering those questions makes the movie the movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had never a dull moment
<START> i can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made stupid unrealistic and stereotypical right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the back to increase speed then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38 000 feet then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane the acting was just horrid and forced there just didn't seem to be any direction i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed
<START> my impression having seen this documentary is that nathaniel kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film br br he took five years to make it a labour of love and longing i can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process what to leave in what to take out br br his father the renowned architect louis kahn comes across as a man too selfish and self absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three but like many men of his character he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity br br one of his mistresses said he was accessible but that is never explored other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate a pity br br the tension between the three half siblings in the room of a home louis designed is also palpable the unsaid hovers over the conversation the only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind some great some not so great br br i was captivated by the music ship and the salk institute saddened by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his callous never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her pregnancy not again br br 8 out of 10 beautifully filmed genuine br br it appears in this case at least the son is not the father of the man
