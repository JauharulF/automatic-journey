<START> this movie definitely shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today and shows how one gurl just with the help of her newspaper manages to get things done her editor has complete faith in her and doesn't publish something important because it would harm her friend and when it was the right time she took the necessary action br br the movie overall got a rating of 9 from me because its got everything i mean it keeps you entertained and moreover they have acted really well for a tv movie its really high quality acting that deserves alot of credit
<START> this film would like to be the kind of shocking cerebral and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been but it's not it is at best confusing and absurd when the twists and turns finally revealed themselves rather than saying ahh i get it i muttered something along the lines of okay whatever in my opinion when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldn't have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would enable the viewer to discern the truth himself but this movie does have a flashback and here's the kicker it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie br br the characters were stereotypical unsympathetic and wholly ridiculous i feel that the steamy love scenes between the romantic leads were the most and unsexy that i've ever scene in a movie that wasn't porn it seems that the director was going for shocking and kinky with the love scenes but they were really just plain silly br br and don't even get me started on the crappy accents and second rate sets i guess the movie was set in new orleans but aside from the afore mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in usa br br my recommendation don't bother
<START> the inherent problem with any staging of 'the merchant of has never been the pseudo controversial anti semitism but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content a frothy romantic comedy and a searing tragedy while mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century and mocked by shakespeare in hamlet it rarely fails to grate with modern audiences as a result most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of shylock br br like so many of shakespeare's great tragic heroes shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character pitiful proud angry vengeful weak arrogant his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be argued over he is flawed not because he is a jew but because he is human rarely do modern screenwriters imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions and it is to everyone's benefit that we have shakespeare to draw on for inspiration br br shakespearean language is wild and rambling saturated in multiple meanings word play and metaphor to be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so when an actor fails the words pour forth in a torrent of incomprehensible words but when he succeeds the english language springs to life with an immediacy and vibrancy that takes your breath away al pacino is one such actor and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that were there any justice would sweep every award in the offering he meets the challenge of presenting shylock head on and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance it would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with king lear br br the supporting cast is noteworthy jeremy irons gives an original take on the familiar antonio presenting an older quieter figure that displays the unsavoury contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudice of the time joseph fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond superficial eye candy to actually inhabit a character for once lynn collins is the only disappointment many of shakespeare's women are underwritten and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life and collins' gwyneth paltrow impersonation seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that radford is aiming for br br the design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of late renaissance venice the city has not looked this ominous since 'don't look now' taking full advantage of extant locations and natural light the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design all again are worthy of award recognition br br the financial backers of films such as this must be commended with a budget of 30 million they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit and yet they invest nonetheless we can all be grateful for it as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a benchmark for many years to come
<START> i thought i was going to watch another friday the 13th or a halloween rip off but i was surprised it's about 3 psycho kids who kill there's not too many movies like that i can think of mikey children of the corn and a few others it's not the greatest horror movie but it's a least worth a rent
<START> the plane is a 747 jumbo the cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747 in the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit they walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors into the cockpit what a gaff the front of the first class cabin has a for jackets and a tv screen beyond that is the radar dome before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway on take off the plane is shown to have only two engines 747 has four engines who was in charge of continuity on this movie during the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets another farcical gaff after that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice versa at this point i stopped watching absolute rubbish
<START> this film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless hong kong triad movies i have grown so tired of there are no spectacular gun fights no car chases and practically minimal action to speak of the audience is kept in suspense for the most part though certain aspects of the so called ploy by andy lau are quite obvious br br the film has been hailed as a departure from the genre of violent triad films and as an intelligent crime film to an extent it is but to some extent it still fails the believability test one can hardly picture any triad member to be dumb enough to not see through the female disguise of andy lau in a second it also seemed to have fallen for the if someone was seriously ill the said someone will be coughing up copious amounts of blood regularly thing chinese films seem to go for all the time br br the subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a refreshing change br br all in all an enjoyable film even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises
<START> transcendental sophisticated incisive emotive powerful i could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence and still i would feel they were insufficient all i can really say is that i am infatuated with this film applause to kieslowski irÃ¨ne jacob and jean louis trintignant may rouge live forever
<START> independent film that would make hollywood proud the movie substitutes good looks for good acting a cryptic plot for a good story line and self absorption for character development may be i missed something go see it for yourself
<START> i made the mistake of buying this since i collect comic book inspired movies even at 6 it was too expensive i thought there might be some campy fun in it a so bad it becomes good vibe perhaps i was wrong i had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it now i know why i was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else i'm all for power punk attitude and absurd humor but tank girl does not work on any front the script is bad you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one liners the special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live action it's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings however cool they might be an uncensored animated feature would be way better for tank girl now that i think about it the action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b movie way the tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated as a matter of fact the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation br br it does have some interesting songs by known artists such as bjork hole and but instead of improving the atmosphere they just don't fit most of the time once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible i think that's when i totally tuned out i suppose tank girl played by lori petty looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her attitude and sometimes barely amusing retorts is more two dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters jet played by naomi watts is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess malcolm mcdowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role it might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves check out the entry for tank girl on wikipedia br br rating 3 out of 10
<START> warning contains spoilers br br written by husband and wife wally who also directed and maya forbes this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory br br jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancÃ©e wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so too julianne nicholson who was so good in tully plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves br br good supporting performances help immensely too lauren graham who made last year's bad santa memorable plays the jaded cynical sister to perfection bryan cranston the dad on tv's malcolm in the middle gets a few funny raunchy moments and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother helen slater in a credible albeit familiar role as a mousy woman br br what surprised me most about seeing other people was how funny it is there are some genuine laughs here ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines and there's a mÃ©nage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked br br the film's premise isn't unusual but i liked that it was alice nicholson who thought of it much to the chagrin of ed mohr given the genre you know that no matter how good her intentions are alice's plan is doomed we see how the couple works through this strange situation initially alice and ed are turned on by the idea but then the human element sets it br br i appreciated forbes and not turning this into a cheap sex romp yes there's sex and nudity but there also are real emotions at work here the other people alice and ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex they have feelings too in one case too many feelings br br granted some scenes run one joke too many the richter slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic but that's forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty check out the scenes where ed through alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game we root for this couple to succeed br br unfortunately this film got little if any publicity and a limited release hollywood studios whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny turgid and unsurprising would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film

<START> i have to confess that i know some of those involved i was in the forerunner to the planet evil however this was more than 10 years ago and i had since lost contact with them i happened to be watching bbc scotland news and a piece regarding scottish cinema this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from it's director mark this prompted me to order a copy of the film on dvd br br now to the film the level of acting writing directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around ok it's not star wars but i've seen many a hollywood product that is far inferior it is very strange watching a film spoken in my local north east scotland accent but that soon passed br br mild spoilers br br the planet draws on several sci fi classics star wars alien pitch black forbidden planet and predator a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible attackers the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survive br br the planet is a brilliant piece of sci fi film making that certainly hides it's limited budget well done to mark mike and all those involved i look forward to your next work
<START> i didn't like this movie to me it didn't make much sense it was hard to figure out what was really happening i also didn't think it was scary i did however think it was silly even absurd but not in a good way radha mitchell is the main character in the movie which cam out in 2003 she was also coincidently in 2006's silent hill which i hated it too i found confusing and pointless visitors isn't as bad but i think it is certainly below average there is just nothing special about it the script is just too muddled and there are things in the movie which don't need to be there in my opinion i think radha mitchell is probably a good actress if she has more to work with my vote for visitors is 4 10
<START> i loved the original p h and was somewhat satisfied with ii and ashes to ashes iii then i saw part iv oh boy as a enthusiast i did my best to give part 4 as much credit as i could but it's pretty bad the wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the film is a horrendous mess for one thing the hatfield and mccoy storyline is incomprehensibly stupid and clichÃ© how did the producers get away with using that tired family feud storyline wow unbelievable the acting besides is below average the plot and script are mind numbing the actual editing and cinematography are average as is the directing i mean the movie isn't a total loss as always i really enjoy watching pumpkinhead i love seeing haggis the witch and like watching ghost in action but all three characters had way too much screen time i thought haggis and harley would wind up going out to a supper club for an evening bite to eat and drinks the way the were being so buddy buddy in her cabin the bottom line is is that i wanted all the characters in this puke fest of a plot line to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the picture where does sci fi get these so called film production professionals from anyway i could do a better job writing a script stone cold drunk i'm sure there was a limited budget and everything but come on see it if your a fan of the other three but just once and then go back and stick to the original two shame on you sci fi
