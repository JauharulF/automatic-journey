<START> how often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments last stand is a refreshment here waldo is selling lemonade but isn't making any money spanky darla mickey and buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 men in a tub and came the brawn where there was competition between and waldo for affection back to the story the gang taste the lemonade to see if waldo made it right one funny moment is when gets a glass cup for lemonade and waldo fills is and gives it to darla and has an angry expression on his face spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even mickey agrees ever so cute when the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time nods no spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty one way is when after mickey said ever so cutely those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty there is also many entertain musical bit is this short the opening number is by darla which she tap dances and sings the second includes singing off key as usually with mickey leonard spanky and buckwheat about how dry i am i believe they sing that to make thirsty it also made me laugh the closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way this was last our gang short a grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10
<START> charlotte beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full time nurse there she is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor is dr masters all she seems to be br br don't look in the basement is one of the best low budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me the acting is excellent my favorite performance being by betty chandler as allyson the nymphomaniac the chills just jump right off the screen you probably won't have to say it's only a movie it's only a movie it isn't that scary but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low budget horror genre which i do it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience but i think that after people see this movie they will see how important the low budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish
<START> clubbed is yet another 'will this do ' entry into the brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who aren't expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers however for anyone seeking intelligent quality entertainment it's really best avoided br br there are so many in the appalling script that even an actor of the calibre of colin salmon is left looking daft the action is set in the 1980s but it's never clear why especially when they haven't been able to pull off any convincing feel for that decade it takes more than a few 80s soul records on the soundtrack the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30 year old cars then we see central characters studying texts such as sun the art of war and speaking about how violence should be a last resort while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosterone fuelled unthinking abandon of a bunch of fighting over a bag of chips br br character development does not exist in clubbed nor does irony subtlety or pathos this is a film which trades on fond memories of guy richie's early gangster films which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit better editing dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga they're a decade old now anyway isn't it time we moved on from trying to emulate them
<START> pretty bad this film about a grizzled and frankly rock stupid old prospector and his i e lassie as well as an annoying kid whose name i can't recall at the moment at the beginning of the movie the old prospector has deliberately buried himself in some sand so that the poor dog will have to dig him out why did he hate the dog anyhoo somehow or other this idiot has managed to strike gold and goes to tell his partner but the man has died and his sleazy other partner is happy to assist old jonathan in digging up the gold the geezer tries to leave is dog with the dead guy's son but not even the retarded mutt wants to stay with this kid there's quaint old preacher for quaint read smelly and the oily guy finished off the old guy surprise surprise and tries to steal all the gold plus he poisons the dog and tries to kill the kid too so i suppose its okay that a devilish and crazy lassie err shep does this the guy in at the end although its pretty disturbing in what is basically a children's movie there are extremely stereotypical to the point of racial slur 'native americans' who speak without using verbs as in me make camp fire type speech and that's pretty much the extent of the cast because apparently lassie's salary was too big for them to hire anyone else kind of dull not very interesting and a tad too dark not a great movie in any way
<START> the film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice never will a jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples although the concept exists in jewish law the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their in a community where children are a very important part of life but nowhere are they rejected by their community as depicted in the film they are treated with extreme sensitivity in fact many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce br br the depiction of a horrible human being is meant to perhaps subconsciously show the behavior of a typical orthodox male in reality it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable br br it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie by someone who is personally biased against a community i have always thought that it is only the orthodox because of their narrow mindedness and insular lifestyle who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies
<START> warning reading this entry after watching the movie like released a year before 'joe' tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream albeit right wing america meet a violent end ensues although this film is for the most part a slow moving display of traditional old fashion american morals versus the 60's do what feels good lifestyle it is also a commentary on upper class vs lower middle class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the meet the boyle's joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s where 'kill a commie for mommy or jap or hippie for that matter is okay so long as it helps and saves america joe and wife mary jo are clearly the archetypes for archie bunker and dingbat wife edith this movie which will forever be known for it's violent but not bloody no blood is seen at all ending is uneven however joe blasts verbally the hippie generation then literally lays down with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate daughter when clearly he should have been repulsed by the idea but forgoes the idea for the sake of sex when he is betrayed through thievery read trust of the older generation to the newer generation he lashes out through an unrelenting chain of murder perhaps it is due to the of hollywood that the watcher expects blood streaming death in the end scene but the bloodless shootings long for any sort of impact or realism 'joe' is not a great movie but it is an interesting display of class and culture alienation and the animalistic underlying extremes to the generation gap
<START> i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between and is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the end br br the first 3 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laugh out loud moments make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous br br the end of the movie the scenes for those of you who've seen it was perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn't bother me and wasn't funny which did br br to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the memories that i can but i have to warn you if you're about to for your ntsc conversion tape from the local don't there are far better things to spend your money on

<START> this is not a great movie as tho the cast especially the kids admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with clichÃ© upon clichÃ© poor family in 50's mid america dying mother alcoholic father 10 children 1 of whom has epilepsy and an awful decision to be made its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being sickly or naff and little frank and steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many times i see it a great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it not on a par to choice but a good tv movie equivalent
<START> the love letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever but they wasted it focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town the movie has an all star cast with nothing to do tom selleck and alice drummond had so recently co starred in the super hilarious in out also about an upset in a small town in which they were both great but here they look as though they're getting drug all over the place i can't tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here if anything but they sure didn't accomplish anything how tragic that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted
<START> this movie is the most moving and funny movie i've seen in a very long time as a housewife homemaker and a fan rupert i found it to be sympathetic anyone who misinterprets angry outburst has it wrong kathy bates is not really an actress i know but she is perfect the whole cast is perfect for their roles julie andrews had me in stitches i am watching it after reading auto biography so the inclusion of her was even more fun it is at times terribly moving i am not really a fan of the type of music in the film but you get drawn in to the romance and find you are singing the songs for days this movie deserves to be more widely available our favourite scene involves dirk and a gun and his trousers watch it and see
<START> jack black and kyle gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic showcase for their side band tenacious d an art rock outfit with satirical barbed lyrics an ex runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a beachfront living pot smoking slacker who pretends he's a rock god meet and form a band the birthmarks on both their butt cheeks form the group's moniker opening with a funny prologue which apes a twisted sister video from the '80s the pick of destiny is a fairly well produced movie aimed at older kids it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle aged variation of wayne's world with jokey stoner interludes and a climactic bout with himself yet black and gass have an enormously comfortable rapport they also acted as producers co wrote the script and all the music the target audience will obviously go for it though inspiration is a bit low particularly in the second half just about the time our heroes impulsively outrun the cops in a student driver car the music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire and for the first thirty minutes or so jack black's manic enthusiasm is infectious 1 2 from
<START> david lynch's ninth full length feature film mulholland drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy if anything it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together it is a movie that does not compromise nor does it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language as might have been the case earlier with lost highway br br although one clearly recognizes classic lynchian motifs and devices the movie remains highly original even in the light of it being a lynch movie lost highway marked a new way of telling a story bred an unconventional mean of setting emotions on to the screen with mulholland drive lynch not only managed to control this technique but takes it to new levels in making it much more complex and multi dimensional in doing this he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind in a press conference on the cannes film festival 2001 david lynch said that striving for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts talking about like this becomes highly relevant to mulholland dr where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create the story in some art the beauty of it lies in its this is not the case with mulholland drive and has never been with lynch it is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds lynch creates the same complexity that characterizes the real world br br it never gets forced like in my opinion for example memento does using an original way of communicating with the viewers further comparing mulholland drive to other movies i think it proves david lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film making in a way that no one has ever done compared to for example alejandro jodorowsky or contemporary matthew barney i do believe that lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or more likely david lynch better understands and executes film making as an art form br br understanding the plot is no small feat but lynch's way of working with sound perspective chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life the lynchian cinema is often and most definitely in mulholland drive a surge of human emotions working with emotions is a delicate craft that demands understanding and depth as lynch puts it a little bit too much and the emotion goes away a little bit too little and it doesn't happen in mulholland drive david lynch has no problem making this balance lynch's portraits span all kinds of dimensions and take different directions creating incredibly realistic characters and situations watching mulholland drive is a journey through the subconscious it is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value that is why i love mulholland drive and what's taken it to the pinnacle of cinema history the ultimate movie
<START> there was nothing remotely funny about this movie it makes fun of various sports movies and clichÃ©s but nothing about it is remotely funny most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it non the main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage thank goodness i only spent 4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on only watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes
<START> this movie was fun especially if your between 8 and 15 frankie and amanda bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it paul giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get' my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it parents no really bad words or any sex to worry about recommend it for the 'right' crowd ap
