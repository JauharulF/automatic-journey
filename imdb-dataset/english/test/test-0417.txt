<START> my mate and i chose to watch this obvious piece of junk purely based on its after nearly 30 years of lousy and rudimentary teen slashers i can't believe that only just now some nerdy horror brainiac come up with the brilliantly witty slogan they axed for it other than that miner's massacre is just as random annoying and forgettable as all the rest out thereÂ perhaps even more the script contains all the typical clichÃ©s and features all the dreadfully stereotypic characters you wish a horrible and painful death to the gore effects are computer engineered and thus beyond pitiable and the obligatory big stars karen black john philip law and richard lynch are entirely wasted in spite of their top billing cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror setting Â the creators of my bloody valentine already figured that out in the early 80's Â but his dull film simply hasn't got any innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer bunch of greedy twenty something losers which refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly can't stand each other an ancient mine in search of the gold that is allegedly hidden there of course they unwarily resurrect the zombie miner this way and he just 150 years of rest in order to prepare for a massive teen massacre yay the cast is exceptionally irritating in this one the girls all have impressive racks but refuse to show anything instead they all prefer endless whining and the taking of needless risks the dim witted blokes clearly just serve as screen fillers in her barely five minutes of playtime karen black still manages to make an utter fool out of herself by depicting the most prototypic and hysterical local nut woman ever the zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face but he looks okay and reasonably menacing when shown in the distant shadow of the moonlight whilst swinging around his pick axe since the best thing about miner's massacre concerns the aforementioned tagline and you can read that on the box in the video store itself there's very little else to recommend here director john carl scored a few modest hits during the eighties like notably the original troll and a fair friday the 13th sequel but it's obviously time to retire now
<START> i had always eyed italian horror maestro dario argento's efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of lamberto bava's terrible demons 1985 the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we're in full halloween swing i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature Â the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but then the film proper which makes no more sense than what's presented in that frenzied two minute montage and in retrospect can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights proved a definite let down br br opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander nevsky 1938 it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative consequently several characters randomly take center stage throughout Â with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on the sinister looking bishop feodor chaliapin resulting a mere red herring the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goat shaped demon culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted all too obviously from rosemary's baby 1968 and a reasonably impressive 13 year old asia argento as the rebellious but likable daughter who emerges as the only survivor by the end incidentally the older argento also co wrote the film's story and screenplay along with director and under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with dario in the early stages of production original helmer lamberto bava and prolific genre scribe dardano sacchetti whom i met at the venice film festival in 2004 br br the extremely muddled second half of the film then sees a group of people Â including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering english couple whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline Â similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of luis bunuel's sublimely surreal the exterminating angel 1962 you see in the end the film is all the more disappointing though sergio gruesome effects at least are notable given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other title i'd watched Â cemetery man 1994 which i own via the r2 se dvd that said i'd still like to catch his debut feature Â stage fright 1987 Â and the director's follow up effort to the church entitled the sect 1991
<START> i am finally seeing the el padrino movie from what i can see it is an incredible film and lots of action damian is good director but i must admit i love his acting the best br br also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit br br however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also br br i am one of those people who love to see artists make it br br b s
<START> this was a excellent movie i deal with a child who i am raising that has and watching this movie was more than word can explain i also purchased the book and it was great i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my son's teachers watch it also i would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it thank you myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children adults with special this movie should be shown again on tv the team of doctor's that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy his special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrow br br thank you
<START> i don't understand why some of you or many have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10 do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason sure this may be a zombie flick with some splatter but thats it i'm not a hater on zombie films but this was awful really actually i should call it more like a zombie soap because thats how the acting is production is well okay barely an attempt at plot development awful acting silly effects clichÃ©s and an abrupt ending go ahead and like zombie movies but don't ever give this above a 5 0 honestly though the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh seriously
<START> caught this 1969 film on cable tcm one night i remember when i first saw the film in hong kong i really enjoyed the songs and performances by peter o'toole and clark i love clark best in francis ford coppola's rainbow 1968 opposite fred astaire don and tommy steele simply ecstatic to learn that finally this delightful irish flavored pot of gold musical is released on dvd ah it's that old devil moon in your eyes br br peter o'toole as mr chips yes he did sing quite a deliverance he may not be a veteran at musical like rex harrison but he inhabited the role marvelously the scene of him running across the lawn in his cape a flying reminds me of the pbs series to serve them all my days a lovable schoolmaster and loving man he is 'mr ' clark and o'toole somehow gave us just the right mix of spunk and circumstance the songs and lyrics by leslie are catchy as usual the tunes of you and i and walk through the world with me stayed with me the most all these years and there's what a lot of flowers and the sky smiled fill the world with love not syrupy at all sometimes i think if the world is immersed in songs and words we would overcome all strife on earth and 'lovely' will be all our days yes talk to the animals too doctor doolittle 1967 br br musicals are a blessing to the world of moviegoers they are somehow larger than life like the music and lyrics by the sherman brothers richard m and robert b who gave us chitty chitty bang bang 1968 and mary poppins 1964 who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply uttering i was tickled by even just one featured song dance number in the spanish film km 0 zero 2000 my all time favorite is french filmmaker jacques young girls of rochefort 1967 with colorful cast of catherine deneuve and late sister francoise jacques michel danielle gene kelly and george chakiris singing dancing to michel music long live musicals
<START> just an hour ago i finished watching this my friend as a fans of dragonball we think that this movie is so bad that is good we will say one thing without a sixpack beers there is now way you can survive through this movie this movie should be watched with a many dragonball fans to laugh their ass off the best character in the movie is the lord horn his makeup his laugh and behaviour crates the unforgettable experience what we liked in this movie was the fact that the island of turtle man was the same as in cartoon version we believe that the only character similar to the one in the cartoon is the turtle man he is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot too
<START> first off i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video i consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song thriller in its soundtrack to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video calling this a music video is like calling the great gatsby a poem on top of this let's face it thriller is a boring 14 minutes including the extremely dated werewolf transformation the mindless vincent price poem just because vp recites it doesn't mean it's not lame and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen sure this was certainly a cultural phenomenon but don't forget this also happened at the same time the a team was the 1 show on tv so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one one last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos what exactly did this add to the equation that billie jean and beat it didn't already add from what i can tell it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog or a superfluous dance scene so you could say that all this video really did was give puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos not quite my definition of great
<START> i am a big fan of sci fi movies so when i saw this movie in the i thought i was in for a pleasant evening what a disappointment such a poor display of special effects i could not imagine in 1980 but in 2005 come on why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price i guess and those killer muppets well i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage you can expect to have a low budget on a movie but i don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget as for the star of the movie i use a lot of quotes tonight lou diamond philips the guy is not even remotely an actor maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies all in all an awful movie maybe i am in a bad mood tonight then again maybe not a sincere 1 out of 10
<START> my friends and i have just finished seeing a preview of this new australian film everyone who was in the cinema agreed what was the point of this film there was no good story to follow the characters were undeveloped and the plot seemed unmotivated i find it bizarre that this film that probably cost in the high millions got funded and made it serves no purpose to the drama community its adds nothing to the palette of australian cinema it really was a waste of time creating this droll unemotional piece of work and more time really should be spent work shopping scripts and creating good stories not creating a mess like this hugo weaving and rose byrne were ok but severely hampered by a bad script pia miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot and her lines were average at best a true waste of talent the saving grace was geoffrey simpson cinematography which like most aussie films was superb br br come on guys think about it next time please br br 4 10
<START> nva combines humor military comedy and teen movie although it is somehow typically german movie like sentimental i think it's a great and very funny movie you will not only laugh in nva but also get a bit of an insight in the eastern germany armed forces of the late 1980ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the german democratic republic br br you will enjoy nva if you liked another movie directed by leander but not necessarily if you enjoyed good bye lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny br br the acting is acceptable but watch for former boy band singer kim frank who has only two facial expressions natural and shocked saucer eyed
<START> colombian terrorists hold hostage a military school in the u s until their demands are met the students decide to fight back will they be able to do it br br silly premise but the film actually works the group of kids who fight were all up and coming when this film came out in 1991 sean astin looking very cute wil wheaton looking miserable keith coogan george perez the token latino who is very handsome very muscular and is mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear t e russell the token black guy and shawn phelan none of them are very good actors except astin but who cares this is a mindless action film the only other good performances are from denholm elliott having a ball as the headmaster and louis gossett jr as the dean br br other than that there's lots of action suspense explosions and little brains in other words fun br br only complaint and this is minor it's a bit too long there are three endings and there is lots of casual bloody violence the r rating was well earned still i enjoyed it a lot
<START> oh i remember watching this show at 4 00 p m during my junior high days it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homework br br still the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems br br but the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall br br the lead actress can't remember her name and i'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details delivered a fantastic performance she made the show watchable br br they just don't make shows like this one anymore
<START> i'm a big time horror fan and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards well let me tell you i don't know whom was giving it all the hype but let me speak on a few things br br first of all this film is not a lot of things it is not scary not suspenseful not overly gory not overly sick except for one season maybe not beautifully scored at all br br the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london we don't even know what they did but it is presumed that they killed someone br br spoiler alert br br the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of cleansing the island of perverts oddly enough the killings are cheap the characters are cheaper and the effects suck br br there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning but even that is done without any care for how it is shot br br end of spoilers br br the end of the movie is about the only thing that isn't totally predictable i especially enjoyed when the herder farts on the husband anyway if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead it's nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread br br 3 10
<START> junior high and high school teachers will find the cure an excellent teaching tool both as a companion to huckleberry finn or as a stand alone lesson although aids is supposed to be the main theme the strong text of friendship and love as they evolve between eric and dexter is a powerful message for teenagers writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective i also suggest directed class discussion about how eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend
