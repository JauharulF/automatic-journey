<START> i will give it this it tried it did try to make it good and even got luke wilson involved luke wilson is good but he can only do so much he can't make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped br br the running gag with the bully was asinine he was never funny and i got tired of the gag really fast and the kid bit was kind of weak too he to florida yeah ok br br the movie felt like an average kiddie film at times with this underlining mantra adults stupid kids smart and that bit gets tiresome br br but the only moments that were funny was the police cart wilson drove around when he lost his squad car i loved that little cart especially when wilson turned on the sirens but other than that nothing else was worth my time d
<START> for those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary this is a unique film part homage to german expressionism part allegory the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920's moreover the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument for advancing the story is stunning aside from this the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice perception and opinion in truth it's not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows in sum this film is something not often seen and as the producer of the film said in the q a that followed will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day
<START> this series doesn't present the british view of the revolutionary war so much as an anti american view of it the underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed british rule that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw britain into a violent civil war that the american supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist violent louts duped into the struggle clearly the intent of the author richard holmes is for the viewer to these characteristics in a straight line from the american population of 1775 to today br br for example in the episode the shot heard around the world holmes up an obscure print of the boston massacre in which he claims the skin of a black man and the first man killed in the revolution was purposely whited out holmes claims that portraying as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause holmes never reveals how he knows this and there's more holmes goes to some length to work in a single unsubstantiated atrocity the desecration of the body of a british soldier he compares the american militia to the viet cong and the without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups the list goes on br br supposedly this series was made in response to mel gibson's the patriot it says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to mel gibson on any topic instead of presenting the british view it seems holmes really wanted to give a sensationalistic anti american view and in the process he's made himself the roger corman of historians strictly third rate schlock
<START> i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even lukewarm reviews i found this movie downright awful the plot flounders around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller then realizes it cannot achieve either so it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot highlighted with a unintentional hilarious scene with laura linney an injection and spilled coffee that leaves the audience awkwardly squirming in their seats looking at one another like is this for real basically it is abysmal and really disappointing for robin williams fans and it makes you think someone blackmailed laura linney into adding this piece of trash to her otherwise respectable resume i wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish i had even seeing it for free i wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time the computer glitch twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid and by the end you don't care who wins the election i vote for straight to dvd
<START> this is on my tv right now but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment the previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better no matter how much i hope and pray i will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time and would be of your time it is not going to get any better i can't believe this screenwriter is doing atlas shrugged i hope he has improved a million fold i see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews but i'm still not convinced if you are familiar with his work please post something here because i really want to see atlas shrugged and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be

<START> this is a brilliant film the story starts off in romania where billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything there is a really funny scene here where crystal is a child and talks his father who is a rabbi into eating pork you may know that this is a parody of crystal's religion he is mainly a talent scout and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew he accidently falls into a small river believing he is dead some huge hands come out to reach him he later thinks he is in heaven he finds out that he isn't but that he is in a monastery believing god saved him he becomes a monk searching for who saved him he later finds a 7 ft 7 in man who he casts as the perfect villain he also recites shakespeare see the film and find out the rest
<START> this is a film about loneliness and how the distance Â physical and emotional between people tends to relationships br br the narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having living with him is too much for they quarrel Â nothing physical just verbal eventually goes leaving alone again end of story br br except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two men br br there are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it all br br or wanting a cigarette opens the door to the balcony of apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then closes the door leaving out in the cold the metaphor is complete br br or cleaning up after grudgingly and with increasing anger and all the while wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends money on a toy for a is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable is rational logical self confident and a demanding control freak the right brain left brain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can convey br br but is not completely emotionless he still loves his ex wife who tells him that she's off to canada with her husband to be affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the wait br br all in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few panning shots some high angle tracking shots a few rural scenes Â but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together and or engage in very limited conversation br br i saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost 'being there' with himÂ and i guess i was in a sense br br i'll say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes that i haven't described it's not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie i've seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone Â just as we are all alone when we die face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long time br br highly recommended for serious movie buffs
<START> by the time this movie came out in 1996 director mark lester had been making tight sharp little b action pictures for more than 20 years he was responsible for the great truck stop women from the '70s and several other little gems unfortunately he's also responsible for this dud it's a shame to see the talented and still smoking hot theresa russell wasted yet again but she's still the best actor in this picture eric roberts shows up for a while does his eric roberts thing then goes away a not altogether unwelcome occurrence in a picture with eric roberts in it frank stallone actually isn't bad which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is as has been mentioned by other reviewers the action scenes which is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first place are almost completely illogical and unrealistic in addition to being somewhat inept other than some vintage clothes and a few old cars there's no feel whatever for the 1930s the era in which this film is set a by the numbers script with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracy this isn't a documentary of course but the filmmakers could have at least tried for a little authenticity and performances that range from grade b to grade school relegate this cheap little quickie to the 4 00 a m sunday slot on hbo which is just where i saw it
<START> take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting why don't you it so happens that back about 1979 director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards if he doesn't break his neck will make the first movie well i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed peralta edited it together well with not your usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today the whole effect is post modern in the best sense but that has been done altman's prediction hasn't quite come true what peralta has done however is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z boys this is all good i highly recommend dogtown
<START> please do not blame korea for this bad movie i am in korea please excuse bad english it me to see these movies which make korea look like obsessed with blood and sex it me even more to see animal killings and hear americans say that is how korea is we do not eat live animals so please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture there is scenes with the man eating live animals and non koreans think it is normal no it is disgusting to us too the director is a misfit sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members i wish america and france will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country please watch any other movie from korea that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are this movie is rubbish
<START> guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin although this film isn't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together all the way around than virgin but then again that's not really saying much br br beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight faced exploit film a couple of yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion as this nastiness is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa and that they're gonna do the same to her they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story the ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide the clinic worker moved by the young lady's story decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the yakuza leaders this whole plan backfires so now ms vigilante clinic worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original got only worse some pretty rough butt rape ensues along with the pre requisite gang rape she too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim it turns her into a raging blood demon no sh t that's what really happens this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty f cking insane kill scenes including a very classy chest burst rape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn and my favorite a head engulfed by demon vagina kill complete with demon vagina slime that has to be seen to be believed br br definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty but still very disjointed feeling beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non compatible way still i have to give the film credit the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall a solid 7 10 for another crazy j horror classic
<START> iam not sure if discussing the television series is exactly where the comments should be drawn to however it is on the television where the the lone ranger really made a name for himself iam not even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this masked rider of the plains iam though referring to a point where in a little boy about 9 or 10 years old i was to see the movie the lone ranger and never forgot it i can recall that i was on a line or we were moving toward the paramount theater the theater was located in the theater district if i remember correctly it was directly across going east to west from the building that has the ball that drops on new years eve this is of course if anybody doesn't know new york city high above the street on the roof tops there was a time and maybe even still today huge billboards would advertise what was being shown and so on it was at that point in time that i looked up and was never more impressed as i was when i looked at that billboard to see the lone ranger across the roof tops it was great it made an impression and was never forgotten that day we went to see the lone ranger it was the story of how the lone ranger was born the terrible ambush that the texas rangers rode into and the subsequent rebirth of one of its fallen heroes it was in this film we learn that the lone ranger will not shoot to kill but to injure so as to let the law be the judge that type of thinking is so worthwhile that we might be good to learn something from history this is where we learn that tonto discovers the fallen ranger and upon seeing the symbol of the boyhood friendship that the lone ranger established years earlier when he as a younger person came to the aide of a injured young person in tonto for the aide given tonto gave to his faithful friend a symbol of his thanks which now was part of a necklace that tonto recognized tonto said you are the lone ranger said sabe that is familiar then tonto tells the story of this trusty scout the meaning of i think the lone ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one of the great heroes of television it should also be stated that these very respected individuals clayton moore and jay sought to live there lives according to the legend of the lone ranger it may very well be that there is an inspiring story in the story of the lone ranger and his faithful companion tonto i myself was so pleased by the ability to find and buy the dvds that i stayed up all a saturday morning and watched the many episodes now available long live the lone ranger and his faithful companion tonto hi ho silver
<START> this film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of mormons across the desert along the way they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy br br wagon master is what i would term a little john ford film as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns in particular this film lacks the big name stars like john wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage long time ford stock character actors ben johnson harry carey jr and ward bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as the lead was probably johnson though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus this is not a bad thing as the film worked just fine without the big star and is well worth seeing br br now this isn't to say i loved the movie it was very good but certainly not perfect in particular as far as the music goes you'll probably either love it or hate it i found the sons of the music a bit schmaltzy at times it did evoke a nice mood but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes i think a little would have worked much better plus with their incessant singing in the background i kept expecting roy rogers to pop out at any moment another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion br br however and i am glad to say there is a despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental the film still worked well this was primarily due to john ford's nice as usual direction as well as ben johnson's exceptional performance he was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film another plus for me is that i saw this in the same week as brigham young another film about the mormon migration while brigham young was a bit silly and overly saintly in its portrayals here the mormons were less perfect and more like real people with foibles and personalities oh and speaking of brigham young it seems as if jane darwell was the 'go to' girl for mormon themed films during this era as she was a major supporting character in both films considering that she died in brigham young and it was set about 20 years before wagon master this is some stunt br br also if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous jim he's in a tiny role where he plays the impassive indian dancing next to jane darwell around the camp fire
<START> i'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive this movie focused more on a let's just make it gory view br br the movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down there is blood just spraying out of the hole i wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively and the original zombie lady kelly or something displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick i laughed quite hard when she died deserved it in every way br br i was a little confused as to why dr kelly could talk after becoming a zombie but then there wasn't anything uttered by another zombie because annoying screams and shrieks and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen yet when dr bennett is expelled from the airplane and into the engine removing most of his lower half he is still able to live at the end br br i kinda felt that they altered things to make a good scene when one of the bitchy girlfriends i didn't take the time to learn their names they played a pointless role was in the bathroom she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror was it a two way mirror to watch mile high clubbers i've never broken a mirror on an airplane bad luck and all that but i doubt there is that much room behind there with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and all br br the few redeeming qualities were too little too late sadly one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight attendants yet they felt the need to kill all but one off and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady chomps down on frank's arm and he says she's me to death or something to that degree br br honestly i'm sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie the fact that i bought it underage kinda redeems that but still it failed on so many levels stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later
