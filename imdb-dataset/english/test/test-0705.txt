<START> hey i think this movie was great and it had great graphics and i was vary glad they used final fantasy 7 i think that game was the best i ever played anyways this is a great movie and i loved it they should make another one but maybe they should ether use final fantasy 7 again or final fantasy 10 there both pretty awesome from tyler sheena i hope you can email me back if you have any details if there is another one people for anyone else reading this i suggest you see this movie it is animated but it looks pretty realistic and its got awesome fighting scenes i haven't see that fast of fighting in a movie for a long time the game final fantasy 7 is also really great not good graphics but its really fun and challenging
<START> context is everything when one goes to rate a movie when rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made we didn't really know what the inside of the earth was in those days so you can't rag on the movie too much for the plot based on a much older book for the era this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great i watched this movie in a masterfully restored hd master for the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster thing this is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits models and creepy costumes awesome ps doug mcclure rocks
<START> this is almost ed wood territory yeah that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office and that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like mozart and why the giant claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw we get big close ups of the ugly chicken foot but nothing more i guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled big mouth might suggest a jerry lewis comedy and speaking of comedies all that anti matter gobbledy gook is funnier than anything in a lewis movie i guess the were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take care of a 1950's flying menace so they concocted a real whopper anti matter from another galaxy yup this fugitive from kfc is supposed to have flown in from another galaxy behind a shield of anti matter as explained in excruciating detail by one of the film's resident geniuses in this case it's jeff morrow a pilot who i gather in his off hours advises einstein on the secrets of the universe br br unfortunately it's also morrow who keeps the ridiculous proceedings out of the bad movie hall of shame since he actually delivers his lines with a straight face what's more he even sounds as if he believes them this is a movie acting triumph of the first order to heck with the oscars morrow deserves a combat medal for performing above and beyond the call of duty under the most extreme bad movie circumstances watch leading lady then you can gauge his fortitude under fire she looks like she just woke up inside a bad dream and maybe if she stands stock still no one will notice her i barely did oh well the first time i saw this drive in disaster was through a beery haze in the back row of what's now a housing development i should have learned my lesson and broken out another 12 pack this second time around
<START> here's what you have to remember about this movie it's a kids movie i don't know about the rest of you but i'm an 80s child i was obsessed with rainbow so naturally i love this movie but if you watch the other rainbow movies this one is by far the best but like i said it's a kids movie you have to judge it as a kids movie it doesn't matter to kids if the acting animation or script is fantastic or even good all they care about is what happens to the characters if the good guy or girl wins then it's a great movie if not then it's bad you all know what i mean you were all kids once
<START> this was without a doubt the worse horror movie i have ever seen forget the fact that the story had little to do with the facts of ed gein ed story is horrific this movie ignored the facts and strayed way off course acting on all levels was pathetic story again for some unknown reason didn't go into the horrific facts could have been so scary if it would have stuck to the facts what were they thinking terrible movie steve railsback version was much much better don't waste a penny on this terribly made flick and why ignore the reality of the horrific events that alone would make for a great story man makes you wonder why this would ever be approved for release why spend so much money on a movie that will never make a penny except for my wasted 5
<START> and there were quite a few of these br br i do not like this cartoon as much as many others partly because it was made in its period i much prefer cartoons with daffy and bugs which are fifteen or so years before hand many people will like this particularly people who always find violence funny cartoon or not br br the basic plot is a pretty well known one for looney tunes elmer goes out hunting daffy leads him to bugs and daffy ends up being shot instead also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes some do not enhance the episode ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre the plot is mainly geared by jokes each joke keeps the episode going this way of plot going is not all that unusual in looney tunes of course if you are pretty much a looney tunes boffin or an eager one like me then you'll know this already br br for people who love everything about looney tunes and daffy duck and like the sound of what i have said about it enjoy rabbit seasoning br br 7 and a half out of ten
<START> bergman and comedy don't quite go together some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince this film has the odd naff moment the last 30 seconds being the nadir but on the whole this is a charming rather than funny piece enjoyable throughout bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well there is a great scene on the train between david marianne and an uncouth salesman which will stick in the memory some of the marriage material is typical cynical bergman but this is bergman in a light rather than dark mood br br this film has its moments and is worth the 90 odd minutes not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for bergman
<START> yep this has got to be one of the lamest movies i've ever seen it's utterly tasteless has no style whatsoever the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it br br sure i appreciate a good b movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do but this has got to be the worst i've seen in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b movie interesting br br the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on screen br br it's not even funny in fact it's quite the opposite i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability br br i find nothing good to say about this movie it was a waste of time watching it and i hope others don't do the same mistake if you also pay for it you should get a serious done
<START> dennis quaid is hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy and he's doing too much to prove it tv sequences are very good like a of old black and white footages music is fine too because mr lewis himself is singing but the rest is just hollywood b movie style with the fifties happy days complex i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder
<START> i usually like these dumb no brain activity movies but this was just too stupid there were way too many clichÃ©s and the plot didn't really make much sense there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt we didn't even get too see if the big master plan worked we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther the professor that died because of stupidity see below br br one scene annoyed me particularly why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen why didn't he bring two or three of them then he would have that was bloody stupid the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all
<START> thank you the for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a m i truly enjoyed it to be honest i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with dru berrymore and of course the talented chloe as rebecca carter br br the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm for example the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie there's absolutely no effort in lightning but let's ignore that fact because let's be honest we watched pleasures of sin because of the high amounts of sex br br the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy explicit scenes delivers the best performance of the female cast br br so my advice is watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs br br recommended only for the sex scenes don't expect anything else
<START> wrestlemania 2 is the only wrestlemania thank god to be held at three different locations and while it was an interesting idea it didn't really work there are only really two matches that really struck out with the rest being decent or most of them pretty terrible there are some entertaining celebrity's on hand like susan saint james ray charles and cathy crosby but the experience was a waste of time for the most part the british vs the dream team match is worth the price of admission itself but you can honestly see that anywhere br br matches br br coliseum br br paul vs the magnificent w mr fuji for the time it had and despite the crappy finish this was surprisingly bearable stuff with the crowd being really into it crowd chants bullsh t at the end that being said it did nothing for career match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring br br 2 5 br br intercontinental championship match randy savage c vs george the animal steele not that great wrestling wise but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved and some great comedy from steele besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes for leverage br br 2 1 2 5 br br jake the snake roberts vs george wells for a throwaway match this was better than it should have been but it's too short to make any impact what so ever roberts wins with the ddt pulling out the snake afterwords which disgusts saint james br br 1 1 2 5 br br boxing match mr t w the kid joe frazier vs roddy piper w lou bob orton a huge failure in my opinion i was bored senseless throughout this and while it may have been a marketing success it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me lot of rowdy chants are noticeable as well t wins by dq when piper slams t br br 1 5 br br horizon br br women's title match fabulous moolah c vs velvet mcintyre ends too quickly before it even gets a chance to start making a record for quick pin fall as far as woman's matches are concerned moolah wins when she takes advantage of missed splash from the top rope br br 0 5 br br corporal vs nikolai volkoff w classy freddie big pop for the corporal stupid match up with boring offense from both involved while being much too short to matter corporal wins when he whacks volkoff with cane br br 1 5 br br battle royal william perry and andre get the biggest pops this is pretty entertaining stuff despite all the nfl talent involved it's also noteworthy for bret hart's 1st ever wrestlemania appearance andre wins when he chucks the hart foundation out br br 2 1 2 5 br br tag team titles british w lou ozzy osbourne vs the dream team w johnny valiant c absolutely tremendous match that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time you won't have time to catch your breath with all the maneuvers on hand and the excellent in ring psychology this is pure wrestling at it's finest you cannot call yourself a wrestling fan if you dislike this match win when dynamite kid heads with valentine br br 4 5 br br los angeles memorial sports arena br br ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez pretty decent match up here with both men putting on solid performances hercules is a nasty brute with above average skills and it contrasted well with high flying style steamboat wins with a high flying cross body off the top rope br br 2 1 2 5 br br adrian adonis vs uncle elmer terrible match with annoying comedy involved the fans love uncle elmer but i do not adonis wins with a top rope maneuver br br 0 5 br br the funk brothers vs tito santana pretty solid match here with a lot of memorable bumps taken from terry funk the one through the table was something else for that time i would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite win with help from jimmy hart's megaphone br br 3 5 br br wwf championship hulk hogan c vs king kong bundy decent pop for hogan one of the most over hyped matches in wrestlemania history hogan can't wrestle worth a lick and bundy is not that great himself the violence was brutal for the time but hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying and there are too many boring moments hogan wins when he escapes before bundy br br 1 5 br br bottom line wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects die hard wrestling fans should see this once but you really don't have too there isn't enough here to satisfy a true wrestling fan vince blew it on this one don't be fooled by the hype of the main event it really is a boring affair like most of the card not recommended and ranks as one of the worst wrestlemania's outside of the brilliant tag title match br br 4 10
<START> a fine performance by vittorio and a masterful one by jean hugues anglade adorn this tale of lust desire and alienation in france the work of the two lead performers is striking subtle intense and passionate alas the script is deliberately turgid and sordid and the overall effect leaves one with a downcast spirit still those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to savor the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of gallic low life br br
<START> by the way it looks at the other comments made it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick it is not centered around zombies as a matter of fact they are not zombies at all they are a device by the wizard to scare the girls to death his main focus is on meg tilly who he wants to help him finish the job that he died while doing in the first place and what you get is a great flick with an awesome ending it is hard to find on video but every once in a while it shows up on hbo or check it out i gave it a 10 and highly recommend it
<START> can you people please stop believing everything this man says get br br your facts straight before you start praising this liar he's not even br br from flint he just says that to keep his blue collar look he's br br from a rich suburb next to flint i mean he went to a private school br br his parents paid for him to go to school wow that sure does seem br br like they suffered a lot from flint going to the dumps he was also born in canada oh wait that makes him a canadian citizen i wish he would just move there instead he lives here in his 1 million dollar new york apartment thats working class right there i sure can't wait for his dvd set to come out i want to here him talking about how big corporations are bad where will i get those dvds oh yeah at target and wal mart the two biggest corporations in america which were also the only two stores allowed to sell them
