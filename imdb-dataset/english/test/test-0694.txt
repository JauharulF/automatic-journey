<START> the original review i had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over harsh so i'll preface with the good sleepy hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer and pizza or sleepover movie the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no one's really focusing on the movie the visual elements are beautiful and it is kinda fun in parts but horror my friends it is not i made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off if this is your intention send me a personal message and i'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations that's a serious offer by the way true horror fans deserve better now my complaints complete with spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers why bother even making a movie based on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense feel tone or theme of the original listen carefully between the lines of ill written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of washington irving rolling over in his grave i will even accept the big city detective bit but ricci drawing around the bed come now not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in the legend of sleepy hollow but it's historical bunk i don't care what neo pagan axe you have to grind but in the 18th century witchcraft meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolical powers this whole fluffy white witch goddess worship an' it harm none approach to witchcraft dates back historically about as far as the british invasion parties interested in real old school pagan practices are referred to james the golden bough if you don't believe me this creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the sleepy hollow legend is shattered so we wind up with a totally different story altogether if that was burton's idea i wish he'd warned us in advance also i wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here and he might as well have dropped the irving pretensions altogether and at any rate the movie isn't scary not once not at all the warped tree came close but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the farce comedy bellowing and finally yes i too wanted christina ricci for christmas but god clearly never meant her to be a blonde
<START> great chris has got to be the best williams that i have every seen he acts it up perfectly this was like watching williams as he really was and is it almost made me cry watching him br br i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits very sad what both of them went through br br i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times i am glad that they ended it in a high note br br i hope robin puts a 100 bill in this guy's hat br br and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver
<START> this is possibly one of my favorite films it tells the tale of a girl named gerda chelsea hobbs who lost her mother at a very young age so has been bought up by her father she falls in love with the bell boy named kai however on her birthday the snow queen bridget fonda comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps kai then goes after kai and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him br br i thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast it has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow i think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy i have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why i have given it a 10
<START> opera the u s title is terror at the opera is somewhat of a letdown after some of other movies like phenomena tenebre and suspiria i still can't find inferno anywhere it's one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic br br the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she'll gouge out her eyes this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory argento fashion br br unfortunately about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical this is especially directed towards the killer's motivations i still haven't completely figured out why he's such a nut the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense br br but for about the first hour or so this is some of best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking too bad it couldn't maintain it through to the end br br rating 7
<START> historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can't be beat so while i'm not a huge fan of the genre i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's british and with decent actors br br i have never read anything by sarah waters which is of course something i should do hence i didn't really know what to expect from this i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story but not much more while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well crafted although there were almost a twist too many somewhere it took me a minute to get everything straight br br production values are good the actors are very solid and the pace is decent although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half hour that might just be me though i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished all in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas
<START> this movie has one of the best club scenes very good soundtrack if you like techno trance music br br some situations as the main character carl begins to take drugs for example are a little off reality but the plot is entertaining but the characters are all a little shallow br br i'd not recommend you to see this film if you don't like techno music br br for the plot acting alone this movie is a 4 10 with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and soundtrack it's a 7 10 but if you would want to go to the movies just to hear nice tracks and grab a little club feeling it's a 10 10 br br the special effects are sometimes hidden sometimes clearly visible i e fast moving clouds sun moon morphing background morphing cuts br br i for one enjoyed it very much a shame there was no in the cinema
<START> this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable plus the low budget shows big time some of the fights were good but the story is laughable and there no menacing villains at all the dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film but chuck norris made it somewhat bearable i really have nothing more to say since i was only paying half attention because it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end the direction is terrible don does a terrible job here with lousy photography an awful pace and overall the film looked dull there is no gore the acting was terrible chuck norris is very good here he kicks that ass and he made the film almost bearable chuck rules george murdock is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing terry o'connor is decent here and had okay chemistry with chuck michael is decent as chuck's brother overall it's quite simple avoid out of 5 chuck saves it from the bomb rating
<START> the film that gave us john waters is one of the funniest films ever yes it may be gross but it's filled with hysterical moments that nobody has done since the infamous dog scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema not a film for the easily offended it's one of those movies where you always see something new performance is worth the reputation mink stole is hysterical this is the film responsible for the farrely brothers and the entire gross out comedy genre i know that sounds a bit extreme but think about it before this comedies were very run of the mill and almost identical after this movie comedies became strange and weird but in a good way i'd give it 15 out of 10 if i could
<START> i would not recommend this movie even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing including the dreaded 'f' and 's' words this kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film come on br br there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along including a prostitute br br the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid' br br despite having elizabeth shue this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it
<START> bugsy siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast in addition to his dreams about las vegas he toyed with the idea of acting he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft so it wasn't such a crazy idea br br warren beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye he's too old for this part beatty was miscast bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries beatty just doesn't radiate menace br br this was a vanity project for beatty who hasn't come to terms with the fact that he's no longer a leading man br br the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms none of which mantegna even attempts to match you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets br br warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye and now it ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts
<START> the unpleasant home invasion genre can be traced back to wes craven's early sleazefest last house on the left with such nasty off shoots as i spit on your grave wrong way and the visitors soon following in the footsteps of that film here in this early '80s italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once more with the twist being that this one is set on a continental train la ragazza del Â known in english speaking countries as terror express Â starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse as the sex scenes start to gain precedence over the more serious action and suspense br br david phil and ernie three rich youths who wallow in terrorising and humiliating others board a trans continental express in italy the train is full of other passengers among them prostitute juliette silvia who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp persuading the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping compartment the three cretins quickly set about upsetting the passengers with their aggressive drunken behaviour but matters get more serious when they seize control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves in from the rest of the train pretty soon they are revelling in their temporary a young wife is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault and later the odious trio force the male passengers to role a dice in order to decide which one will rape a 16 year old virgin travelling with her parents a concept made doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game the only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being escorted to germany but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs br br la ragazza del gets off to a decent start various intriguing characters are introduced and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual gutter level of its genre things fall apart during a horrid scene in which is sex sandwiched in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs the scene is gloatingly filmed and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the instead we are being asked to feel turned on this is sensationalism at its worst further humiliating rapes follow but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of oral sex and the female genitalia one sequence featuring the 16 year old girl teeters on the brink of hard core and feels particularly wrong by the end of la ragazza del it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense lovers of sleaze will revel in it others might want to look elsewhere
<START> legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne dies of a heart attack a bunch of drama school students steal corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for his grave writer director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh original and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga atmosphere the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods with a gal being set on fire a juicy decapitation the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b flick faces mayne has a deliciously eye rolling ball with his flashy role leon contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed up director wolfgang talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs rohmer plus there are nice turns by luca as jerky drama student ringleader saint jennifer starrett as the sweet meg jeffrey combs as the geeky stu and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo popping up in cool bits are chuck porky mitchell as a detective patrick wright in one of his customary policeman parts and cochrane as a corpse joel king's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot a fun little fright flick
<START> after renting one true thing the other night i have learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted i have never seen such a real life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like meryl delivered she deserves the oscar nomination but she has some tough competitors in the running all i can say is beautiful film great acting from streep and meryl streep revealed her one true ability in this excellent film
<START> this isn't exactly a complicated story it's not a mystery or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films however this isn't one of them those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked with ghosts this doesn't apply the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail it jumps from one character to the next never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching because of that you don't connect with any of the characters you don't get to the point where you care either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems it's going to redeem itself or their actions are despicable and you're not inclined to anyway refusal to go very far to help is a good example his refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part the only characters you may momentarily feel for are when she's being questioned and then tortured after her rape by lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around lorenzo's invitation to supper with family and her fathers all out attempt to force lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back then just as things start to be developing again they're gone from the movie i've read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didn't know what it wanted to be etc i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything from lorenzo's return and the coincidental viewing of daughter by goya everything seemed nothing more than contrived without much of a storyline no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place the essence of who goya was didn't materialize other than his actions or lack thereof proving him to be more self centered than anything else as for his art the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself to sum things up best the movie had no cohesion it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered and upon ending left you feeling like what you'd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them you can't watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination there's just not enough to it to waste the time it's not a case of your missing out on something it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good just aren't there as for best film ever made it's not even the best film i've watched today
<START> and atmosphere this film has but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes almost comically so in early scenes in his which he trades in for a garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr lyn harding what wasn't clear to me was why would have wanted his stepdaughters dead if as in the case of helen angela baddeley he didn't want her to run off to get married he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched br br other abound as well after setting an early wedding date with helen the fiancÃ©e is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet death provides merely a diversion and what could have been an interesting murder tool a poisonous snake is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding br br stewart competently portrays holmes' aide dr watson though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea as lyn harding is sufficiently menacing a trait that would be put to good use as holmes' nemesis professor moriarty in two later films 1935's the triumph of sherlock holmes and 1937's murder at the baskervilles br br with repeated and an unsteady camera it's surprising that the story line isn't more disrupted than it is it's integrity is generally maintained even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps i guess that would be my main complaint with the film as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the
