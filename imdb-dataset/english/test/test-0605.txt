<START> a tough life gets tougher when the three children of a single mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely passing br br to stay together the older boy plans a daring high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle their only remaining next of kin br br their trek takes the three fearful runaways on a chase through the desert in a classic beetle penniless hungry desperate terrorized by delinquents and too young to drive hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities br br what the movie lacks in acting and plot realism it makes up for in the honest human need to be a part of a fulfilled and complete family even if that family is cobbled together with spare parts of broken lives br br sure the ending is forced and too over dramatic for the critical movie goer but every heart beats the same cry for family togetherness and belonging br br with all its weaknesses i still give this movie a strong recommendation
<START> the aristocats is really quite charming and is rated far too low on imdb the songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the jungle book but they weren't bad at all the animation is really lovely the best sequence being the landscape of paris in general it looked beautiful this is probably disney's most relaxing animation i think and as another reviewer quite rightly said who doesn't love cats another great piece of animation was o' looking into duchess's eyes as their romance was so believable while not obvious a good thing the plot about a greedy butler and a fortune reminds me of bailey's billions was a little unoriginal but worked very well and the script was really funny especially the fights between the kittens they remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters always fighting my favourite scene was the chase of edgar with the two dogs who were always fighting about who was the leader the voice talents were a delight most notably phil harris whom i recognised from the jungle book and eva gabor from the rescuers the supporting characters namely scat cat were also well done in conclusion a really pleasant film that is definitely underrated 8 5 10 bethany cox
<START> one of my favorite bum actors c tom howell stars in this tepid remake of wotw he runs around a lot while a cgi generated spider like machine goes around killing everyone the budget for this one obviously was pretty low it also was one of the asylum productions have you seen any of those yikes i am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big budget spielberg version was slaying them at the box office and if truth be told neither version is all that hot the george pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the h g wells novel primitive special effects and all perhaps because gene barry was much more convincing in the lead than howell or tom cruise
<START> et juliette is one of those french romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules rather like belle pour toi the gorgeous daniel auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash around his ears the film isn't a preachy morality tale but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the last richard as juliette is a heroine that women will cheer her laughter is my abiding memory of this warm and witty film the down to earth way she has of including all her children by their different fathers particularly the birthdays gives the film an edge that lifts it above your average romantic comedy but its always the french that seem to show us how effortless this all is
<START> no pun intended i'm not going to spoil anything about the story but it's safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays and of course being a priest while being naughty exaggerates all that plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan wook yet br br if you have seen previous works movies you know he is very visual in a good way and it shows again here while it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath and when that boils quite a few bad things start to happen but through all that dark there also moments of light fun to be had too a very stylistic and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job
<START> one crazy summer is the funniest craziest not necessarily the best movie i have ever seen br br just when one crazy scene is done another emerges it never lets you rest just one thing after another the soundtrack is great the songs are the right ones for the scenes br br it is also a clean movie little that is dirty in it br br of course it has the story of the guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch money taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources who'd want to see it if they failed there is a serious side in that parents and children do not live up to each others' dreams one should always have an open mind and weigh all the options this applies both to parents and children in one crazy summer the parents are wrong this is not always the case
<START> cyber zone as this dvd was sold in oz is about the worst b grade junk i have seen apart from a restrained deadpan act from singer indicating he knew how bad the movie was going to be the other actors sway about genuine attempts at line delivery swanson and quarry or absurd imitations of classic movies scenes hues makes the most ham fisted portrayal of dying since jim carrey's mask all of this with no real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof by genre period or any common vein is plain annoying don't even try to join the dots with the plot it is blade runner thinly disguised with no content actors or scenery due to a very limited budget you gets what you pay for is never more apparent there is repeatedly annoying re use of limited sets with no attention to set dressing and a spew of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for dr who in 1976 the helicopter explosion is worth a rewind to demonstrate my point of course there are masochists that will lap up this tripe but if you are watching this movie for a bet make sure you get more than your pay rate at 2 this dvd will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster
<START> imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines but all i really want to say is this is an incredible film and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play but i have to type something so let me point out the following br br 1 river's edge contains what still may well rank as crispin glover's all time funniest and best performance in a film and if you have been following crispin glover at all you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10 funny lines galore br br 2 river's edge contains the second most memorable performance of dennis hopper's career other than the one in blue velvet and it is really excellent dennis hopper is really funny br br 3 river's edge contains the best performance of keanu reeves' career and it is excellent it was the role he was born to play he has plenty of good lines but one in particular is really really funny listen close when his character and the step dad are talking to one another br br still the best stoner film it is much more than just that it tends to show up in the drama sections of film rental stores but if this is a drama it's the funniest drama of all time
<START> basically this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible director which happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie i've ever seen so avoid it at all costs br br as for this documentary it's entertaining entertaining and blatantly misleading most of the historical looking footage is most likely just that historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise there's no doubt that waverly is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it's own fascinating history but manufacturing a documentary to market the locale and the related production is for lack of better words appallingly useless br br and yes i've lived in kentucky my whole life and i have visited the location numerous times waverly hills deserves respect and there's nothing respectful about this lame documentary
<START> the racketeer stars carol deprived of the e that usually appeared at the end of her first name lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist roland drew who has since become a down and out alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong top billed it's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies stiff direction immobile cameras stagy acting and ridiculously slow paced delivery of lines at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s l o w l y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs done about five years later this could have been an interesting movie but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies the racketeer was made in 1929 a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces Â vidor's hallelujah applause wyler's hell's heroes capra's ladies of leisure Â all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act too bad howard higgin wasn't that strong as it is watching a naturally rapid paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak one can't help but wonder where that 50 foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him
<START> they do each sequel is worst you who think that ghoulies 2 or 3 need a 1 please watch this sequel you'll be wondering with the first three parts then you'll give a 10 to the first 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other that's because ghoulies 4 really gets the big 1 from me it does
<START> do not miss this picture that defies ages with no hesitation a masterpiece not only the script and the music but also casting br br cut everything contributes to the perfect achievement now nearly 25 years ago and still amazing of maturity art and br br sensitivity available now in dvd do not miss either the is perfect br br and the sound re boosted one mystery remains about this superb work why the actors did br br not succeed better after this flashing start
<START> i know this movie isn't for everyone and i won't push my opinions on you but what i have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie it was the best i have ever seen it was funny and even though it wasn't the scariest movie i had ever seen it kept me on the edge of my seat because i didn't know what was gonna happen next if you like funny scary movies you have got to see this one
<START> this lame harold lloyd sound film has nary a laugh in it and makes one wonder if this lloyd is even the same one that made all of those delightful and hilarious silents br br lloyd's boyish likability becomes fey and limp when we can hear him talk and a sluggish restrained pace replaces the zany antics of his silents lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows up in china and then finds himself transplanted to contemporary new york city without a clue as to how life outside his chinese village works he finds himself an unlikely victor in a mayoral election and quickly draws the ire of all the government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption when he's framed in an attempt to bring him down he decides to play just as dirty as everyone else and stages a fake execution of every crook in nyc as a scare tactic this darkly satiric ending feels out of place next to everything else in the movie but it's the only part of the film that comes remotely to life everything else is a dull bore br br i don't like having to admit that a harold lloyd movie fails because i like him so much but i don't have a choice with this one br br grade d
<START> movies seem to fall into two categories films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs and those that challenge them this film is a 180 degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like the longest day and the green berets which seem more like disney fantasies by comparison the apocalypse now project the production and resulting film is heart of darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post modernist variety the cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve this is the plight of joseph conrad's original character kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in ts eliot's the hollow men kurtz he dead of 1925 although neither a straight telling of conrad's heart of darkness 1901 nor a first hand account of the vietnam experience apocalypse now stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se like platoon and the deer hunter but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale apocalypse now is not so much seen as experienced br br the bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin captain benjamin willard martin sheen in a tour de force performance aboard a us military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of vietnam and cambodia where few westerners would ever tread his mission is to terminate colonel kurtz marlon brando a career army special forces division officer who was the darling of the us military until he went awol and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between vietnam and cambodia the official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the american public none the wiser br br the movie is rather episodic the journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as sheen and his crew meet different self contained aspects of the war at the ground level american audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film making before with the possible exception of the deer hunter which was released in the previous year the first and one of the most notable is an helicopter battalion led by col robert duvall in an oscar nominated performance who is a cross between general robert e lee and richard wagner he loves to play ride of the valkyries from wagner's the ring when he bombards helpless villages his line i love the smell of napalm in the morning is one of those oft quoted lines from the annals of cinema other encounters include an where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of hugh and playboy bunnies br br despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing the original release not the later redux version does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between willard and kurtz the strange discourse between willard and kurtz is worth the price of admission alone and some of the shots of both sheen and brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film not even the likes of clive barker wes craven or david cronenberg have anything on coppola in terms of horrific imagery brando's kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within br br without giving too much away coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations according to the documentary hearts of darkness coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised he wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom coppola was using as extras in the scenes with kurtz at his village after the viewing coppola had his ending and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of american film making love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene br br this film is not for all tastes just as conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes it's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most american viewers to absorb it's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban american life that make this film difficult for the average movie goer to handle which is as it should be coppola did not make a family picture however if the viewer can understand its larger point there is a lot to be gotten out of apocalypse now if you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre existing attitudes about american sensibility and heroism better stick with john wayne but if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been even beyond the evils of war rhetoric apocalypse now will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it
