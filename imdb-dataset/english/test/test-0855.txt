<START> well of course everybody is entitled to have an opinion about a thing everything the presentation was interesting black and white movie the year 1968 students manifestations general strike youth ideals love etc sorry but i did not sense love romance a lover who is all right that his girlfriend sleeps with no matter who that is love but not only that the movie is very long and for no reason i had to stop watching the movie several time because i simply lost interest i waited for something to happen but nothing the only thing i was impressed during the movie gypsy fiddler playing in the streets yes that was nice i do not think that art should be complicated encrypted hidden in secret meanings confusing big disappointment and waste of time
<START> first and foremost i take issue to the title of this movie is not a spanish word the name to which they are referring is i imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way but i assure you it is singular in spanish br br next i thought this movie had been done years ago it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town then it would have been kind of scary br br let's talk about the special effects the most important is the costume used for the given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that isn't so the shape color and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney world br br there were times when the was walking where no man could walk his movement were jerky and strange at these times but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man br br another thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it the would kill one then the next but it never seemed to actually eat the victim you say it's just a movie and i agree but the idea is so far out there that it's stupid br br what country is dr pena from he sounds sort of hawaiian british something else but i think he's supposed to be latino the problem is his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he wasn't latino br br the soldiers fired round after round at this thing and weren't making a dent yet the continued to fire i'm no military man but don't soldiers especially the special tactical forces such as this have to have some wit about them to perform their duties wouldn't they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new they didn't they just kept firing away while the continued to slaughter and not eat them br br did they have to kill the little dog anyway my vote was 3 for this flick because it was bad why did i watch the whole thing i'm sure you've done the same on occasion so don't give me an flack
<START> is this a game fmv or a movie in all honesty i watched this one out of choice less ness it is a very big waste of time and money br br it seems hk movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world br br try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch rather than something you want us to watch br br the graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid 90s low resolution games in comparison to today's br br the way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s' wing commander game namely the third installment of the series stop and make us asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in hollywood br br sure they have big budgets and better actors but we have some of the oldest histories the myths and the legends the best and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world so what went so very very wrong did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films please stop wasting our time and money this is the reason why hk movies are heading downhill so rapidly didn't you claim to be the hollywood of the orient guess not
<START> i saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in february of 1983 i was in the hospital having just given birth to my first and only child i'll refrain from telling you the extent to which i was moved suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day almost 23 years later i hope i can find a copy of this movie if such a thing was ever made this movie should be remembered fondly by anyone who ever saw it however i must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me this way it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved by it i never saw ms margaret perform a better part nor have i ever seen her in a more convincing role i will forever respect her just for accepting such a lovely part
<START> br br the amplified dispassionate female voice could have been leona in heat but no it belongs to allison hayes as nancy archer the 50 foot woman of the title in the most infamous role of her film career allison's performance literally rips off the roof in fact make that a couple of roofs br br jaw droppingly tacky is the tale of nancy a neurotic boozy heiress and her loveless lothario husband harry william hudson who also co starred opposite the amazing colossal man nancy has a close encounter of the third kind in the desert with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini skirt and gladiator sandals and who has a thing for nancy's jewelry what he does to her once he's carried her off is probably best left a mystery but soon nancy starts to grow br br treading into the center of town on tranquilizers tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets the buxom heads toward the low rent saloon where harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named honey yvette vickers the confrontation turns ugly br br the poverty row f x make the alien giant and nancy appear to be transparent due to incompetently transposed images you'll understand why director nathan changed his name to nathan on the credits was no stranger to directing giant creatures human and non having also directed the deadly mantis the 7th voyage of sinbad jack the giant killer plus several episodes of tv's world of giants and land of the giants br br a lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons
<START> the mad monster starts in dr lorenzo cameron's george zucco laboratory as he perfects his discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his dim witted servant glenn strange apparently he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters the ultimate soldier however first things first as dr cameron has his sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who dismissed his experiments forced him to resign subjected him to public ridicule dr cameron puts his plan into action uses his monstrous creation to murder professor blaine robert strange in an unfortunate turn of events dr cameron is unable to control the beast is spotted by a local farmer jed harper eddie holden who spreads the news like wildfire in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named tom gregory johnny downs gets wind of the story starts to investigate he starts to suspect dr cameron since gregory is going out with his daughter ann he has plenty of opportunity to sniff around br br directed by sam this is really low budget stuff from the 40's even worse it's dull unoriginal low budget stuff the script by fred drags the extremely thin premise out to almost 77 minutes which is far too long there is no variety in the story it's basically the same thing over over the character's are dull clichÃ©s the mad scientist who conducts pointless experiments that create a monster the fragile pretty daughter the reporter who plays the hero by pure coincidence happens to both be investigating the mysterious deaths said mad scientist is responsible for is romantically involved with his daughter the dumb servant stupid idiotic police stereotypical shotgun wielding farmers who are always accused of being drunk this was probably clichÃ©d even back in 1942 the film plods along at a fairly slow pace director never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing technically the film isn't great obviously the budget was minuscule the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless wino who hasn't shaved for a few weeks has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in his mouth the black and white cinematography is basic static like most films from this period while the good dr cameron's laboratory consists of a couch a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top the acting is stiff wooden with looking like he's on dope throughout the entire film zucco as the mad scientist doesn't convince is forgettable the mad monster is a pretty lame horror film there is very little here to entertain although at least i made it through to the end in a single sitting which when i think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself
<START> this film for what it was set out to be succeeded it's a short tragic film although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships this film is meant to just give a taste leaving you with the what happens next factor after watching it i really was wanting more more of the characters back story what influences they had to make them into the people they were i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think the acting is amazing there aren't many lines in the film so their body language facial expressions and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene both franco and miner have that element and it shows for them especially franco to take the time to make this obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that i appreciated the film for what it was also i'm happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would've never known it existed
<START> i was watching the sci fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on while not as bad as curse of the komodo this still sucks bad wynorski uses the same island as in curse of the komodo as well as the same actors and house the effects are top notch suprising but thats about it i don't know what else to say about this movie oh yeah as in curse of the komodo the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island also when i saw this part i laughed hysterically a part man komodo and cobra overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie steer clear to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating it's almost over it's almost over 0 out of 5
<START> watching some of the sequences err the entire 1 3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice in alexander a film directed by the russian legend sergei m eisenstein co directed by in his only significant credit made me realize how much must really go into directing at least on a scale such as this if i were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release i probably would award eisenstein with the director's award of the year posthumously it is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work battleship potemkin and october it could have been something he scoffed at at first but amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later lord of the rings fans meet the films' grandfather so to speak br br to say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it and often a bad one it is something that has a full blown message to it and a point of view it's still a matter of hot debate see the swarms of argument over moore's films for proof about whether great art can come out of something that is point blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner in this particular case the russians against the germans at the time it was nearing ww2 and russia once again faced the and it's interesting to note that eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film as a rallying call for the russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history the end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing battleship and october however if nothing else comes through those films it's that eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together for the viewer that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail on those terms alexander nevsky is fearless br br but even with the whole idea of great germans bad' there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent a little less strict to these ideals for example when we first see the germans in they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent not that they aren't out to take whatever they can they have their own national pride going too that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their christian led masters tell them to at the least the evil of the picture has a face however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in there's also a brief scene before the ice scape battle where the russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little because more often than not in alexander nevsky with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare there aren't any complexities to characters most notably nevsky himself played in ultra heroic fashion only questioning near the start by nikolai who perhaps has to be this way in intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale after all to be looking for naturalism in an eisenstein film is like trying to find non kosher pig's feet at a deli br br but the real reason to see the picture isn't the acting anyhow but for the look of the film how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that eisenstein lays out on the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his 20's films with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities of the hundreds of people rolling on through in fact i'd say that any director working in hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic particularly war would do very well to take a look at this film even with just the sound off it's even better if thought of as a silent film with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times one could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice how it starts with the german soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs and then how eisenstein inter cuts between close ups of the actors fighting and then to wide shots and with sped up editing and of course one can't discount the power of the music as well sergei delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work all the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed if this was just a short film it would surely rank with the greats much like the odessa stairs sequence br br if i did find it a little less than totally magnificent it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound while i have yet to see ivan the terrible my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors which is really as broad as can be with the melodrama at such a high pitch its staggering the sub plot of the two soldiers vying for the olga is the best example i can think of but even this considered alexander nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to grade a
<START> what has to change in today's attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach the approach is awful comparing it to pulp fiction seeing only the pornography and all its aspects come on people there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture and to all the hasn't paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again magnolia is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this industry that film making is today and what about there will be blood that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not yeah you the so called consumer you know something f k you you don't deserve this you don't deserve anything so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films even mainstream because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff like that sell out britney spears br br anyway this was very painful for me to say because i don't want to see this i don't wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers sales revenue and sales return i want to see magic the magic that fellini bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema because thats what pta is doing he is creating magic
<START> engaging characters nice animation dynamite songs all this and cute kitties too there's a lot of excellent humor but no real menace so don't worry about your little ones the two farm dogs steal the show even though they only appear in two scenes the artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people but i find it charming
<START> ok i gave this a three a three it deserves only one star no questions asked br br if your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit b horror movie than yes it will get one star but i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap br br with this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more hollywood but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish we laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy br br the acting is terrible the effects and death sequences are so bad the story complete crap br br but the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie priceless br br the most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed dark basement which is clearly lit and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling just terrible br br so if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie br br wait why am i writing so much no one knows about this movie i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha
<START> korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head and the latest by the celebrated director chan wook park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe br br directed in part in a style similar to the sympathy trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark steering clear of clichÃ© it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust however the film doesn't take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughout br br our leads play their roles to perfection playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour there are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but it's worth giving it a chance to the end br br if you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late dark and engrossing it will pull in a crowd one i'd recommend you give a try
<START> as was mentioned by others could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former wayne's world star mike myers play a serious role the story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters if there was any good scenic shots of ireland then it would give it another reason to see it but instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green of the emerald isle that are often shown in irish films if there was any cultural to admire the irish personality it would be worth seeing however this could have almost been shot in england too bad for myers but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of guiness
<START> not since j michael babylon 5 has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show this is easily the best thing on tv right now the characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well being the villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they're up to next and brian puppet work is the most innovative out there kudos to s for a job well done
