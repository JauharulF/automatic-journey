<START> another example of the women in prison genre this is not exactly a genre known for quality films but this is a notch below most a bunch of women are taken from the where they work to a prison on a rocky island once there they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious dialog for a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it the sex scenes are awkwardly acted and some scenes like the shower scene seem to drag on and on that said there are at least some minimal production values on the w i p scale i would put it above fur but below chained heat
<START> oliver stone hits the bull's eye with this film aided chiefly by electrifying screen presence and biting brilliant screenplay every moment crackles with a steadily growing tension climaxing in a truly memorable movie going experience if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile into a seamless union of creativity then this is it the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame br br an ultimate indictment of our society's increasing morbidity and self sickening hunger for the next big thrill br br a film not easily forgotten i highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature
<START> i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film the film's story is not dismal but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal the acting was absolutely dreadful the children were overly whiny a metal pole could have done a better job i wanted desperately to fall asleep but because the television was so loud i was kept from peace the monkey's are neither cute nor are they funny the drama is laugh worthy i cannot remember when i saw a more dreadful film the story is weak thin predictable and completely fake the adults try to be good actors but they just can't seem to break through stereotypes the girl even appears to want to leave the film via falling off a hill during the movie in order to leave it i don't blame her micheal anderson should publicly apologize for this film not just to me but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film in fact i apologize to you even if i had nothing to do with this project i apologize for this film because this means at least someone will this film even surpasses the dismalness of films that of rob schneider and the cheetah girls i would even go as far to say that it is even worse that hilary duff's collection of films but that's pushing it just please don't see this film or else you'll be pushed to write a review similar to this one on how awful this film is i'm very sorry
<START> i remember seeing this in the early 90's on uk tv and was hooked the international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent the scenes set in pakistan and afghanistan are of particular interest and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the cold war the characters of and helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like the sopranos and six feet under in this area in the uk the vhs goes for about Â£6 and the dvd about Â£10 a quality bargain i thought soderbergh's version was great too but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt
<START> this started out as a good sketch comedy the first few shows were very good and i was looking forward to a long run what was really funny was the mariah carey imitation and the take off on beverly hills 90210 featuring the hair fight the delta burke vs william conrad heavy weight battle was also good unfortunately the following shows went downhill relatively quickly the writing became uninspired and oh so predictable as if the show had acquired a cult following in it's young tenure nothing fresh was being offered and the recurring skits were boring one example is the gun family or whatever it was called which became a weekly feature this sketch was not all that funny to begin with let alone being a regular feature an example of a quick promising start then a sudden fall
<START> this series has recently been unearthed and excerpts can be seen at least within britain via http www org uk tv id index html presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely the problem is that this series was followed by the series the wars of the roses that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable tv or at least crowding the market br br the two series are quite different in dramaturgy the wars the plays through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes an age of kings follows shakespeare more closely both series benefit from integral casting
<START> this movie was over shadowed by 'the bruce willis richard gere which was released the same year having seen both films i can honestly say this is the superior film br br granted the production value of 'the was very good it probably had a substantially bigger budget however 'the is well written and has a fascinating story aiden quinn is flawless in dual roles aiden quinn and director christian duguay did a great job of establishing a deep and multi layered relationship between the title character and his family i particularly liked the ending br br i was reminded of the jack ryan character in the tom clancy movies both are naval officers thrown into unbelievably dangerous roles as they covertly work on behalf of national security and yet both harrison ford and aidan quinn reveal their respective characters as heros who manage to be both virile and gentle they have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families br br what i don't understand is how the opinions of all who have posted on this movie myself included can be so much more positive than the luke warm reception the film has received this is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains compelling after multiple viewings if you are a fan of espionage genre films i recommend 'the enthusiastically
<START> from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film lets put it this way i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought 'i can do better than that whilst sat watching this pap the acting in this film was terrible i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place the storyline was mediocre and i suppose like most films if the rest had been done well it would have stood up i don't usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating must be cast crew i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack
<START> story chinese tall story tells the story of righteous monk who along with his guardians monkey sandy and make their journey west on a quest to recover ancient finally they reach the final leg of their journey in city but all is not as it seems when the city is attacked by evil tree demons monkey tries his best to battle them but is overwhelmed knowing his master is in grave danger he uses his trusty golden staff to thrust to safety br br the monk ends up being knocked out when he land and when he wakes up he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard imp named who takes quite a shine to our young hero after many verbal misunderstandings becomes convinced loves her so when the monk decides he must rescue monkey and the others she insists on accompanying him so the mismatched pair begins their adventure together br br review okay so it's another journey to the west movie which isn't a bad thing to me since i love the story and the characters associated with it so i was a little excited to get my hands on the dvd so i think i'll start off my review with the story which is all over the place at first it was your standard fantasy film then it became a ridiculous comedy then suddenly became full blown sci fi if the director jeff lau was experimenting with mixing genres then he did a pretty scatological job with this movie i think it's a pretty unique approach by having the story centre on a character other then the infamous monkey king especially taking a character as pacifistic as and then putting him into what is at it's core a love story so overall i liked it br br the acting is for the most part solid with leads nicholas tse and charlene choi putting in some really good performances though ah char does spend most of her screen time behind some rather ugly make up the supporting cast is nicely put together it includes all the usual main stays so and isabella leong make appearances one actor i'd like to mention is wilson chen who plays the monkey king he did a good job with the limited material he seemed to have been given he played a version of the monkey king who was subdued yet arrogant i had a feeling he'd be twins effect ii territory but fortunately that's not the case here i hope he gets to do a follow up to this with himself in the central role since the film does leave itself open for a sequel br br okay so let's get down to the directing which again is kinda all over the place lau gives too much time to the stephen chow esquire nonsense comedy which includes a scene where in order to toughen himself up dresses up as spider man which i assume lead to many a head scratching moment since the film is meant to be set in ancient china he does create some really nice and tender moments between the two leads and does delve into sappy territory but this reviewer does enjoy a bit of sap on occasion so it didn't bother me in the slightest br br right now onto the cgi which for the most part is quite bearable there are a lot of moments which probably belong on a ps2 like many other reviews have stated but there are some cool moments particularly the scene in which monkey battles a flying minion a lot of the cg gags are provided in the form of the golden staff which turns into a range of different things ranging from a giant fly to a mech suit straight out of the matrix revolutions so yeah it sounds crazy but i guess you'd have to see it to believe it br br right so in closing a chinese tall story isn't a movie without it's flaws but it keeps itself together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a overall enjoyable movie if all of the above doesn't swing you to see it how about i put it this way it's much better then twins effect ii
<START> this film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide she is tormented by her son who refused to speak after that br br child grief is rarely explored on film so it is refreshing to see a film like addison's wall however due to the very nature of the film there is no tension or drama apart from a few key emotional moments everything in the film is very plain the abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable addison's wall could have been much better such as exploration of the contents of the wall a more intensive care program to help addison to go through his trauma instead the film feels very unfinished and non engaging
<START> i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem except to say that it represents young buster keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half dozen best short comedies ever made the goat is twenty minutes of smoothly paced expertly photographed beautifully executed gags two reels of non stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending which wasn't always the way with buster's comedies see cops for one case where fatalism ultimately got the better of him or one week for the victory of defeatism if i had to describe this film in one word i'd call it effortless but if i were permitted two i'd call it seemingly effortless for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease still they didn't call him the great stone face for nothing buster never let the public see him sweat br br a sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along row i e on a bread line in a grim urban setting where buster waits patiently at the back of the line and as a result doesn't get fed but it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos buster has our sympathy but he never asks for it before long through a series of accidents coincidences and absurd misunderstandings buster is believed to be an escaped killer named dead shot dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around and yet while he's clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self pity or even surprise we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him and that he hasn't time to feel sorry for himself anyway he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap br br just as buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either which is especially impressive because the goat must be one of the most laugh packed short comedies in existence this is the film that features that iconic shot of buster riding a train's cow catcher right up to the very lens of the camera which isn't a gag exactly but sure is laugh provoking in its own strange way meanwhile there are gags involving guns dogs cops an incredibly furry mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under buster's weight a surreal sight indeed but some of the biggest are saved for the finale when buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis big joe roberts a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady virginia fox trapped in big joe's dining room buster leap frogs over him and sails through a turns a phone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade out gag br br to say more would be a disservice to first time viewers i only wish i could see this film in a theater full of people who'd never seen it before and float on the laughter live musical accompaniment would be nice too and incidentally the musical score supplied by kino for their home video dvd version of the goat is first rate serving as icing on an already tasty cake
<START> there's something going on in this film directed by x files scribe john that has eluded me you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet i feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward it's about perception there are characters the heroine nicole jaimie alexander meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish this might seem like a spoiler but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part they seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not it never gets a proper answer and i for one was a bit clueless at the point there comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psycho drama now there's nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us that's how i felt as i watched rest stop this film is supposedly about a young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jesse joey to make it big in hollywood they make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing someone in a crusty dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind jesse's disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be br br that's the easy part when a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the cabinet she meets another a police officer in the area joey lawrence who might seem like her savior but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with the truck driver commits torturous acts to nicole like her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast br br it's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that has me listless perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare it doesn't make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea why does he make himself so obvious why does he allow her to prepare it seems i'm going out on a limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack yet why does decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd meetings with people that don't exist what is and the writing team trying to say and to cap off the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in a rv they play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all
<START> and obviously i didn't see it br br but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one won't you say br br and i can't believe that someone like louis gossett jr would return for something like that br br did jason really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film br br i'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd
<START> i found this dvd in the library and based on the jacket notes it looked like it might possibly be interesting a black comedy set in 1940 france just as the germans are marching in boy that should have them rolling in the but it does this is a clever original suspenseful and funny film i don't recall seeing anything like it before Â foreign or u s that the writer director can find humor when we know part of the outcome the germans will occupy france for four years is remarkable that he does it with such charm is part of the delight what starts off as black comedy and fluff even ends up having a couple of serious moments Â including a race to spirit out a cache of heavy water which was part of the preliminary research for the a bomb and a quick history 101 intro to the beginnings of the vichy government that would govern southern france for much of the german occupation but don't let any of that that scare you off the movie itself is funny charming and romantic and races ahead at steady clip br br one of the best things about it is the combination of actors we've seen many times adjani and depardieu and others we've never heard of before along the way there are two star making turns virginie and both are impressive but mr is especially so according to imdb he was in ten films before this one Â but he also won the cesar as most promising actor for this role so apparently he was not all that well known even in france he is a combination of romantic lead and comic actor Â and he makes it all seem so effortless you may be reminded of cary grant in bringing up baby and arsenic and old lace Â it's hard to do comedy on film because the risks are enormous that the actor can come off looking inept but grant pulled it off charmingly and this guy does also i should think we're going to hear more about him in the future br br to be sure this film won't please everyone Â there's a little bit of violence although nothing you don't see on tv every day but if you're up for something original you may feel after you've seen this that you've unearthed a cinematic gem br br the so called spoiler in this comment
<START> it carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of vietnam and into the wild eyed look of martin sheen and dennis hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding colonel kurtz i don't say marlon brando because after watching the documentary hearts of darkness i am skeptical as to how much credit brando is due for that quality the tone of voice i'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing everybody gets what he wants i wanted a mission and for my sins they gave me one they sent it up with room service it is indulgent without being narrow and alienating a good example of is hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness generously installing lines written by t s eliot and rudyard kipling into his stony monologues i mean the man's a he'll walk right by you without even saying a word and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say did you know that is the middle word in you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs and then i mean he's a wise man he's a great man i should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas the first one's kipling the second one's eliot
