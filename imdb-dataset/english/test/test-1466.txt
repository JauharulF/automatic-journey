<START> it is inconceivable to me how anyone could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie i'd say it's the worst movie i've seen in years and i see a lot of them maybe i've forgotten junior high it's also very hard to believe that this is the same jeff daniels to did such a brilliant performance of george washington in the crossing seems like ever since he did dumber he's gone into the tank can you believe he even wrote and directed this junk
<START> my name is earl 2005 br br review for i have seen this br br this is something else first off how is this rated so high i cannot understand that this show is filled to the top with either annoying people stupid people or just plain unlikeable the gags are hideous br br i saw one episode where the wife of earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish not kidding that wasn't funny that's repulsive then she and earl's extremely stupid brother and i mean stupid then had sex i nearly threw up br br this has to be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time jason lee is a talented actor but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible comedy br br earl is now in jail for this current season let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery br br the last word this show would be funny to people who think larry the cable guy is funny to the rest of the world not a chance avoid like the plague
<START> well it's about time van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years the plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex marines as drug smugglers twist is cool but what makes this movie awesome is the fact that van damme is back to doing martial arts again his latest films have been more acting oriented but in the shepard is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape there are some impressive fight scenes and van damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360 spinning heel kick for being a low budget action movie it does have good sets and great stunts van damme says some humorous lines and shows that he's improving as an actor i'm glad he's back to dealing out some van damage i've been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films scott adkins is great in his role and van damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end overall it's one of van damme's better films and it will keep you entertained a must rent for fans i'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like bloodsport or kickboxer su
<START> french cinema sucks down with all these visions with their my god am i cultivated distinguished attitudes pestilence to conceited symbolic film language and impervious i'll no longer have a mind for that carax did you ever think about that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid maybe i'm too common to understand you or had it been your task to confirm all the clichÃ©s of a frenchman the world can have guillaume the to be comes to his home palace mme deneuve not in the picture plays the flute here am i darling in this moment i knew that she's in the bathtub and we ll see her lying in there soon don't misunderstand me i'm not prudish and the sex scene was the climax of the film but this is in berlin we say what means something like a self satisfied and the worst seen that often in french movies i can tell other example she beautiful and willing is looking at herself in a mirror combing her hair and her wild bearded dirty young guru into the room breathless shouting there's no escape there's no escape forty years after and what's new what's exciting about my god there's that woman and she loves and admires you what would be more natural to be happy with your life and when you're not please explain much better why born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza no escape is that the point
<START> the supposed writer and director mr dhawan has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster hollywood movie hitch starring will smith many scenes are also exactly the same the plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humor probably mr dhawan's own creation and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standards br br although salman khan and govinda's acting did give us some smiles however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs
<START> what bird is that a maltese falcon the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael hair which has more depth and character than the man underneath it br br the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue salutes to raymond chandler and humphrey bogart and crime fiction etc seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or the reason this film has no and near forgotten is it's so vacuous an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers this film is what the title suggests
<START> this is classic 80's humor if you were a teen in the 80's this was a summer hit to go see it was a early look at those now super stars this and better off dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager even crazy family and friends like these characters to be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun the uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner the twin brothers who look nothing alike and to meet was so much fun this may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon
<START> seeing that this movie was on the imdb bottom 20 i simply had to rent it br br suprise suprise i have no regret of seeing this movie at all in fact i really enjoyed it there's a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics of the 80's to shame is it stupid yes but jim wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after all br br rent it for a laugh that seems unintended but is actually meant to be funny wynorski is a genius hope he directs the next ninja turtles movie
<START> the film heaven's gate was a good view although still tedious at over 4 hours but the film took great license as usual with hollywood james chris christopherson and elle were actually married in real life their main contribution to the johnson county war was to start it by being hanged well by starting it i mean it came at the beginning not the end here's the real scenario james and ellen watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family by filing as single individuals they could get two homesteads they chose on crazy woman creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the association he offered to buy them out repeatedly which they refused br br although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel cattle kate and a prostitute herself and also in the film there is no real evidence that was true it is known that she bought many head of sick cattle nursed them back to life and was later accused by the association of receiving the cattle in trade for lewd in the end she was accused of rustling an act almost certainly untrue so much for this part of the myth of the american west which is a de gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years br br in real life she and jim were surprised one day by several members of the association taken in hand and promptly hanged those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial but that was the first link that led to the murder of nate champion and the start of the johnson county war br br quite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end br br other than that i think the main problem with the film was the editor who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing
<START> some spoilers it took some 19 years for bruce campbell to finally put his masterpiece man with the screaming brain on the screen but campbell had to alter his story by having it due to financial problems take place in sofia bulgaria not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in los angeles california br br in the film campbell plays us pharmaceutical tycoon willian cole who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife jackie antoinette byron to the former communist republic of bulgaria it's there that william wants to help finance almost non existent mass transportation system br br it's poor william's misfortune to get involved with both gypsy woman tamara and her ex boyfriend an ex kgb taxi driver the two william will unwittingly end up their brains inside william's skull because of jealousy and vindictiveness br br after murders both william and their bodies are delivered to mad scientist dr ivan stacy keach by his loyal assistant ted raimi to have their brains experimented with dr has this theory in that two heads are better then one and now with the material william available to him dr at last is finally going to prove it what dr is going to sadly find out is that by fusing the two heads or brains together their brain waves will overlap and cause them to not only malfunction but turn against each other br br william with right lobe fused into his damaged brain is out to find and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and for his part is stuck in william's head who's likes and dislikes in both food and drink are totally opposite to his own this causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of william's body br br things get even more screwed up when jackie finding out that murdered her husband william confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of call gypsy town and ends up being murdered herself brought back to dr by his assistant it's determined with no body available to plant jackie's brain inside of an experimental robot that been working on the operation is a rousing success but the only drawback is that jackie with her brain inside the robot has to have her brain every few hours or like a real brain lacking oxygen she'll die together with the robot's batteries br br combination 1930's like screw ball comedy and horror flick with both william turning the bulgarian town of upside down in trying to find and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence she put them both into br br spoiler alert it's dr who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting and thus cooperating with each other this is done by him instead of fusing the brains together dr keep them independent by implanting a cell wall in between the two uncooperative of gray matter
<START> at first i thought that this one was supposed to be somewhat of a comedy horror when i had seen the body in the bathtub with the lady just standing there screaming over and over again but as the film proceeded on it got more and more flat the plot was silly with a man upset that the prices of real estate have gone up so now he to call up some radio psyciatrist and babble out his fury because he has nothing better to do then the law gets involved and tries desperatly to make us feel that they really care who the caller is and go out of their way to track this guy down one suspect after another are accused this movie is terrible and the slow moving love scenes of adrian b and her husband are boring and made me just fast forward the movie avoid it
<START> i don't think i will include any spoilers but if i do i can cover my butt the last american virgin came in a time were such teenage coming of age high school sex romps were the rave films such as 1984 hot times 1974 and the popular porky's 1981 were making mucho money yet it is the last american virgin the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations it is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity the go to the wrong places prostitutes the dangerous ones older woman with jealous boyfriend and the convenient ones luring their high school female counterparts the movie has a lot of funny moments and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star it is worth remembering for a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes devo the cars journey and others by today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a nc 17 rating but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain while love might be right in front of us it is a little piece of 80s americana and worth having in your movie collection
<START> before i sat down and watched this film on hbo i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot well that's exactly what i got out of it except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie i wasn't expecting it to be i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste well it was but still it was somewhat worth it the whole plot was very stupid cheap acting and some of the lines were very very dumb otherwise than that it still had it's funny moments even though not many br br all in all if you're going to rent this don't watch it on television i gave it a 4 i was generous because it made me laugh but yet it was still pretty stupid
<START> i found an incredibly frustrating film to watch it starts quite well and moves along briskly until the first which is a doozy after that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story it was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot if you hate film where you can't understand why characters do what they do you will loathe particularly the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense also at the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to her friend rather than generating sympathy from the audience most people started to giggle this was probably because the of the story was a complete idiots finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be 'shocking' and comes from the horror cop out school of 'people are bad audience so just accept it without any br br is neither good or bad but mediocre and annoying
<START> this is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens these people are going on a trek the young girl wants to photograph animals there really are no piranhas but i guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha anyway there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving there is considerable anti gun talk but we all know where that is going toward the end there's lots of action and a rape thrown in somebody must pay and they do it would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to sort of fill the thing out there were lots of monkeys if you fast forward through the dull parts you have a tight little five minutes
