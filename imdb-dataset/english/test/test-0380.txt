<START> take a few dark and stormy nights fog coming in from the coast obsession and doubt two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred a suspicious disappearance a shoe in the night silently grinding out a glowing cigarette butt and finally a tremulous heroine who finds herself threatened as much by her own doubts as by one but which one of the men around her sounds like we might have a good 80 minute noir instead under the direction of vincente minnelli and with two a list leads katharine hepburn and robert taylor undercurrent becomes a nearly two hour matinÃ©e melodrama a long slog of threatening angst amidst the perfectly groomed and dressed cast when you glance at your watch half way through a movie and with a sinking heart see that you have another hour to go both you and the movie probably have problems br br minnelli in one of his earliest non musical movies doesn't lay on the hothouse approach as heavily as he later was known to do still what is basically a simple story of greed murder and obsession is turned into an endless katharine hepburn vehicle hepburn shows us in carefully lit close ups how to demonstrate fear love anxiety giddiness happiness doubt suspicion and terror robert taylor is more or less along for the ride br br hepburn starts the movie as the tomboyish ann hamilton an energetic young woman in slacks who helps her father with his inventions their housekeeper is determined to get her married when dr hamilton decides to sell an important formula to alan robert taylor it's love at first sight is the smooth handsome dynamic inventor of the distance controller which was vital in the war and which has turned him into a hard charging millionaire manufacturer he's a captain of industry as one of his many washington friends says ann hamilton now ann may still be a bit of the tomboy but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those congressmen and judges her husband knows she learns fast and eagerly they both are obviously and blissfully in love br br but wait the is about to gnaw ann realizes she knows nothing about her husband's family none of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk about them to her when she learns bit by bit that alan's mother died in the old family home in while seated at the piano or that he has a brother michael who has disappeared alan becomes very quiet and sometimes goes into a rage he always apologizes but wait once more did his mother really play the piano didn't she really die in bed wasn't michael caught taking money from the family firm and alan sent him away all this plays out against the exquisite hotel suites the manicured country home in with the horse stable and the tasteful ranch house by the sea everyone in the movie except employees are dressed to the nines there are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty even in a black and white movie minnelli can't help but give us dining tables filled with crystal and china tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of gowns br br by the end of the movie when all is finally known when ann on horseback is chased along a high extremely well designed mountain trail by the bad guy on another horse when she is threatened with death by boulder and her pursuer finally meets death by horse it's a relief even robert mitchum who plays michael is unable to bring much tension to the movie what might have been in lesser hands a taut little b movie instead with the a list is just an overwrought melodrama too big for its bones
<START> kramer vs kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget it isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films but it does not mean it still isn't important i thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it the performances were the best positive for the film and dustin hoffman played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates from him billy who is hoffman's son played another great performance along with meryl streep playing the depressed mother of billy kramer vs kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10 but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it certainly one of hoffman's best films he's ever done i highly recommend it br br hedeen's outlook 9 10 a
<START> when you read about this film you wanna cringe i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself so what is the attraction here i think that for me it's the of the romance i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmy breslin like columnist and a down on her luck health wise ballerina you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint he's a bit overweight at least as a would be suitor for a ballerina hope that doesn't sound unkind and possibly a tad too old for her nice change of pace from greek god wooing super model the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later which is a pretty good sign however some of the acting is just dreadful a subplot involving a young puerto rican boy befriended by sorvino's character is just hilariously bad but the opening scene where is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story good luck finding it you'd think that lifetime would be re airing this or even we but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years
<START> the opening scene really got me into watching the movie however not more than 5 minutes later i was already gouging my eyes out not only could i not understand a word that was said the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped the one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget however i didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two african americans but i guess anything is possible also why the hell was robin in the movie i'm not sure that it added anything artistically overall i would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this movie
<START> this movie has a fairly decent premise one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films most spectacularly in alien and some decent he man performances from the male cast the possessed astronaut's wife to me is the weak link in the ensemble she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes for which i blame director corman br br given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play blood beast might have been pretty decent but the inherent cheapness of the production design and the continuity errors and gaffes undermine the proceedings for instance every time i saw the comatose astronaut laid out on an examination table the width of an ironing board i broke into giggles probably not the the emotion the crew wanted to invoke and the monster's costume needed some serious work fern covered parrots just aren't scary or convincing br br still the premise was strong enough that i hung on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve itself and the alien's motives were sufficiently ambiguous at first that i could sort of think of it as an enigma and the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of punch to it along with the plot development where the alien claimed to have assimilated some of the dead man's personality br br it's corman it's cheap fast and mildly watchable if you don't think too hard or expect too much what more needs to be said
<START> this movie was sadly under promoted but proved to be truly exceptional entering the theatre i knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it br br i was caught off guard with the high quality of the film i couldn't image ashton kutcher in a serious role but his performance truly exemplified his character this movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies it does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case i highly recommend that everyone see it br br this films is truly exceptional
<START> i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in '97 and it still made me laugh out loud it's skillfully written kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle you're more of a man than i br br for that matter i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline where kevin kline listens to the how to be a man cassette and the post almost wedding scenes w joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie br br sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending but few movies are perfect
<START> to my eternal shame i've never seen a silent movie not even the mother of all vampire movies nosferatu however if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from buster keaton then i'll probably try to watch a few more this is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies the premise such as it is focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as keaton is mistaken for renowned bad guy dead shot dan co director malcolm st clair this leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate keaton br br you're left amazed and entertained in equal measures keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt man judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like jackie chan on speed and the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard my better half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much if you've never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch it certainly blew away any ideas i may have had about silent films naturally it isn't as polished as today's movies the acting is pretty awful truth be told but that doesn't matter because you're enjoying the movie regardless anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed brilliant
<START> ab tak is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai india is a hard working hard edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers imtiaz becomes frustrated by high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when allows him to take the lead on his first case further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics br br i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india the camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds the acting pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director amin has taken liberties with factual accounts nevertheless ab tak is an extremely polished piece of film making
<START> especially after watching the matrix reloaded spoilers br br after seeing the matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make believe robotic characters with their super powers it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk i cared about these people and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much it still left me feeling like it's possible verses what a stupid video game like the matrix br br this movie isn't brain surgery it's very straight forward some things are predictable like knowing that someone is going to be a back and that someone early on is going to die pretty obvious but so what the first 15 minutes sets up our reason our motive our main objective br br i like that theron and didn't have any make out scenes i am glad that they didn't go there they kept it about funny dialogue especially seth greene that guy is funny br br this is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd it's fun fast and entertaining the only thing and i guess it's a big thing is that we are really rooting for the bad guys this group of are already on the wrong side of the law not a good message for the kiddies parents please explain this to them br br
<START> oz is by far the best show ever to grace television better than the sopranos yes er yes csi absolutely uncompromising daring and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television tom fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing no topic is taboo rape drugs murder oz is evidence of just how good tv can be it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races but always comes back to your everyman tobias in jail for vehicular manslaughter we see what we don't want to see pain death mayhem oz will disturb you make you cringe make you look away but most of all it will make you think to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production
<START> with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie well it is a stupid movie with a horrid script but the f x namely the eight legged freaks makes this flick a hoot to watch a tribute albeit on the silly side to those great mutant creature features of the 50s arquette and sheriff sam kari wuhrer summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in arizona also in the cast are doug e doug rick leon and the charming scarlett johansson
<START> i'm sorry perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911 perhaps it's an old fashioned story perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but i'm sorry this film is awful as in the title clichÃ© 49 i think it has at least that many clichÃ©s it's a dreary story impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved about a fireman and his dreary life told in a pointless from now' flashback to the past style we begin the film with the hero in peril in a collapsing burning building the entire film is about trying to get us to love this guy so we squeeze a few tears out when he meets his end in the finale of the scene from the start of the film i found it hard to care and wished he'd gone up in smoke earlier clichÃ©s abound such as death of best friend love at first site hazing in a new job a worried wife with a husband with a perilous job a father figure boss superior 2 4 kids well 2 but close enough sacrificing your life to save others awards for bravery on and on it's every life every police officer nurse doctor in some way it was lazy if it was meant as a 'life flashing before his eyes' as he died then god help the poor chap i'm surprised he didn't suck in more smoke to go quicker the flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable dully acted and with a soundtrack that could put the laughing cow out of business it was so cheesy it actually sounded like muzak or copyright free elevator stuff to be avoided at all costs unless you need something to watch with granny of a sunday evening or maybe if your related to a firefighter warning your life will end horribly or you will be scarred for life if you are a brave fireman according to this movie unless your john travolta strange style hair in this one

<START> historically awful scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of one cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching as with all track and filed movies nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown from the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the la olympics
