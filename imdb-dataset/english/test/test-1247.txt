<START> the film has no connection with the real life in bosnia in those days should be more realistic and shows the viewer real traumas that were happening to common people during the war please see some films of yugoslav authors emir kusturica e g bure a barrel of powder tito i ja tito and me gore beautiful villages burn beautiful etc just this is the real way to know about so called bosnian problem hollywood is definitive not th right address to make films about the balcan peninsula maybe vietnam ww ii but not of the living in former yugoslavia
<START> a friend of mine decided to rent this thing lucky it wasn't my money pretty much wasted my time though a story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing directing maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over acting gary busey's character for example all the over acted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention for all the wrong reasons obviously where the movie in itself failed miserably in short a waste of time and money br br 2 10
<START> if i didn't know any better i would have thought resurrection was made in the late 80's early 90's when crap sold as film in hollywood br br i don't understand why people like christopher lambert he speaks like he's reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emote he was easily the movie's weakest aspect the other actors were ok nothing horrible br br it's easy to see where the majority of the budget went the special effects the killings look pretty professional but hardly make up for the film's dullness br br i wouldn't go as far as to say resurrection is a carbon copy of se7en but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it centering on a religious minded murderer on a modern crusade the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible passages and christian history to piece together the killer's puzzle resurrection however is bereft of se7en's clever storytelling cinematography acting well everything that makes it good instead resurrection lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise it br br in conclusion resurrection was about as bad as i expected it to be i almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since i knew it would be bad going in but sue me
<START> i'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie so it is grainy poorly written bleached out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull the person i was watching it with fell asleep twice and yet there is something in this film that fascinates me though i am not sure what perhaps the character of sam an enormous former patient who was by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop or the marvelously played head doctor i forget her name br br anyway watch it and form you're own opinion it has one of the greatest endings i have seen in film
<START> roy has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be a piece of art that is both beautiful funny and evocative at the same time the end result is a moving if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms br br this is unlikely to appeal to everyone in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its wavelength the almost absurdly long takes awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences but it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that shapes a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments with the characters seemingly left alone in their own oddity its a difficult piece to watch at times not least because like many of its scenes it requires patience but whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne others will simply look on in confusion its a film that blends understated humour with own brand of heart
<START> cheerleader massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the slumber party massacre series if that's what they were doing which it is considering one actress from the original returns in a small cameo role they have failed miserably and made by far the worst installment of the cheerleader massacre seamlessly combines bad acting a horrible plot a dumb killer dull and boring deaths boring scenery and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made did i already mention how bad it was don't get me wrong this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as napoleon dynamite but it is undeniably a horrible movie br br cheerleader massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original slumber party massacre stay away by all means this movie is utter garbage
<START> i was hooked in by the premise that the show was about demons from hell and a doorway to hell what i didn't realize was that i would be watching some guys run around tunnels chased by small children who may may not have been demons for the entire movie sure there was some dialogue in between and great underground scenery but the lack of a plot developed characters any twists or development in the story at all was sorely lacking oh and out of interest there were no special effects the entire budget was spent on actors salaries sets and lots of time running around with a camera underground br br the ending was one of the typical lackluster boring endings that makes you say i endured this film of boredom for that if you want to see demons and a doorway to hell i promise you that you would be better off served watching the trailers to the game london which while shorter than this movie at 5 minutes pack more dialogue character development action plot and satisfying conclusions than this br br the second star is for effort but overall a low score for failing to make a movie that stands out and for promising in the tagline much more than what was delivered
<START> when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland they died with their boots on 1941 is most likely the film remembered best it is the sweeping saga of general custer flynn told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon dehavilland through his tenure during the american civil war and finally with his death at little big horn director raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable of historical texts rewritten by screen writers wally kline and mackenzie until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion hence the battle against chief crazy horse anthony quinn is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians california joe charley grapewin and a absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nation's first peoples br br flynn who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold to two parts albert has never been more ignoble he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine resident warner stock players arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them br br overall then despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn they died with their boots on is ample film fodder for a saturday matinÃ©e or sunday night with one's sweetheart warner's dvd is pretty nice looking although film grain is often obvious the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep solid blacks and very clean whites some fading is obvious during scene transitions the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level
<START> the plot of sally of the sawdust is the usual melodramatic stuff an orphan rags to riches but the film rises above most silents thanks to three people br br this is not of course d w griffith's masterpiece but it does showcase his film making savvy in full maturity he uses all his innovations which are techniques we take for granted now close ups cross cutting a mobile camera and the ability to modify acting from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety br br w c fields also showcases his skills not his signature gruff delivery but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian he does a few inventive juggling acts cut too short to be fully appreciated and some very deft pickpocketing but it seems that every prop that comes within reach gets manipulated for comic effect hat cane car roof dog cash he's a joy to behold br br finally there's carol dempster much has been said against this actress but her performance here is also richly comic she was 22 at the time playing a teenager and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be wholly convincing but she truly engages the eye when she's on screen particularly when she's dancing she's not a beauty though she's positively luminous in the one scene where she's gussied up like a talmadge sister but her plainness only adds to sally's character especially in the many moments when she shows very obvious affection for fields as her guardian father few if any hollywood performers could compete with fields when it came to comedy but griffith gives his leading lady every chance to match her co star and dempster absolutely holds her own
<START> if you suffer from insomnia then radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7 year coma the film is so preposterously overwrought and mundane that it's hard to imagine that director steve could overlook such obvious dullness br br the story has an exiled doctor who we never get to see move out into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts full of antibodies that can combat any infection yes just like that episode of futurama the don't work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours br br not wanting to be caught by the government guys in masks the group head into the desert for cover hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus all of this is narrated by michael the only one of the quartet immune to the infection and it's the most boring narration ever they could have cast someone with an interesting voice but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than clive owen br br on top of this the editor insists on fade cutting more than half the movie giving it a weird dream like feel and increasing the audiences desire to go to sleep it's no surprise that half of the audience walked out of this i was not one of them for some reason but i bloody well should have br br the ending is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding but it's plain and simply not a relief yes but not dramatic in the slightest br br the utter cheapness of this production and muffled sound that renders a lot of the dialogue unintelligible cripples what could have been an interesting sci fi story if it had better actors cooler locations and a sense of urgency as it is radiant is a snoozefest
<START> hit and run is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who has it all until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene hence the title the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns but is frightened away by angry passers by who think the hitter abandoned the scene this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story br br colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self loathing hole causing her to make a bad situation worse br br this is a very thought provoking story and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain wishing throughout that she would simply come clean br br as a tv movie thanks to colin and a strong script this is a well above average tv movie
<START> when it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didn't watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is a very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to it br br back then 7 out of 10 now 3 out of 10
<START> alfred hitchcock's remake of the man who who knew too much is usually not considered to be as good as the original but for me it is one of the best films ever i prefer it over vertigo and rear window br br like north by northwest it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family br br while the original was good for it's time it is hard to watch by today's standards the remake has excellent production quality an endearing doris day and a really creepy villain br br don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over
<START> i watch this movie every time it plays on tv a simply brilliant film three men return home from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty all three led opposite lives during the war executive banker became an army corporal a soda jerk became an air force captain and the high school football hero loses both his arms in battle and now each must reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality the homes they return to with grown children and independent working women along with a depressed economy only add to the strife it's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly however the awkward intimacy of frederich march and myrna loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader both at home and at work are heartbreaking br br dana andrews is riveting as the handsome decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform br br the film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actor br br this film however took on a whole other level after seeing saving private ryan the reality and magnitude of what these men lived through for love and country and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield br br this is an essential for any collection br br
<START> without a doubt the most impressive recent gay oriented film i've seen c jay cox hit the nail on the head with this one the way he handled the issues surrounding faith family and sexuality were very well done casting was perfect wes ramsey did a fantastic job at pulling off the character of christian and steve will knock your socks off in the role of aaron both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and the impacts these issues have on young gay men as a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment though not mormon the identification with aaron's character was phenomenal for me strongly recommend this film to anyone faithful or not who is interested in how young gay men have to deal with family and friends in an oft times unfriendly world by the way the music in this film rocks another great job by c jay cox
