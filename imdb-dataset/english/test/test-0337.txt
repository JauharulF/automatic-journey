<START> a truly scary film happening across curmudgeon james rants led me to recently formed web logs like life after the oil crash energy bulletin and the oil drum and the data behind the theory of peak like this film and paint a grim picture of die off or die back i hope they're premature but in mid 2005 rising gasoline prices rising oil prices will you join us campaign bp becoming beyond petroleum and even t boone pickens lend credence to the idea that we are at or near a peak of oil production br br after copious research of limited data oil investment banker matt simmons has suggested that the may no longer be able to increase production in their immense but aging fields in the face of increased demand primarily from the us and china the have not responded with higher production despite previous assurances stated world production from 2000 and 2004 indicates that light sweet crude has indeed peaked which means that will become more costly br br the film seems aimed at baby boomers but younger people our children also need to understand the implications of an energy depleted future
<START> this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it robin is somehow mystified by an elk man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of and outright satanic episodes the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor this is barely watchable and to top all the ridiculousness they kill robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and oppressed watch the classic series or the newest from the bbc
<START> even if was your favorite film it would only be possible to watch it at most every ten years its just too emotionally strenuous widely regarded as finest film the ascent is the story of partisans operating in the forest in the dead of winter in german occupied soviet union br br while assaulting the audience with the sheer physicality of the wartime experience particularly the of cold and snow the actual struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists there is always a subtle barely inferred sub text of moral judgment and the question about whether a man can be moral or immoral in one context but otherwise in another br br a partisan group hiding in the woods is attacked by a german patrol and loses their food supplies two men who knows the area and a jewish schoolteacher are assigned the task of going to a small village for food they find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timbers and foundations in which in one cubby hole there's a children's mirror hidden the overwhelming feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a land and a people become truly cursed i thought of the war that the americans and british brought to iraq and about how bringing the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate nation br br the two move on to a nearby larger village where they obtain under duress a lamb from the collaborator the arrive and the two partisans escape under fire is hit in his foot and holds off the as gets away with the lamb becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive he removes his boot in order to put a bullet into his head just then returns and drags out of the line of fire br br drags through the forest bloody meter by meter all done in one long take each meter is an agony and yet he still pulls him through deep snow up across over black bush stumps which crack as they snap under the weight of the men there are several similarities to the cinematic vocabulary of here the long takes documenting a process the effect of using repetition and the resulting emotional stress which builds the longer the shot goes on in the background unnoticed because of the action there hangs a question did commit an immoral act by going back for whether under the moral standards of marxist or merely the common imperative of the survival of the group wasn't his duty to get the food back to his starving band and leave to cover his escape to sacrifice one man in order for the group to survive which leads to the question can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system the partisans come as if another curse of war to a farm house containing a woman with three small children she is embittered by the scourge of war and barely hanging on with her three children they are barely rested when more germans show up they make their way to leave and are directed to the loft to hide br br cough gives them away when a german pops his head in to have a look and no one responds he threatens to fire across the loft and nerves break and they are captured now who has the moral responsibility here for coughing or for cracking the two partisans and the mother are trussed up and taken to a nearby town passing ominously under a wrought iron arch at the entrance they find the and a small girl already in custody they are interrogated by a turncoat played by favorite keeps his head during interrogation and torture and only asks what the prewar profession was he doesn't answer but from his ease standing behind a desk the likely answer was br br on the other hand begs for his life and even offers to join the police the previously unnoticed character defect making a 'wrong' moral decision the ambiguity sentimentality of which disguised it from judgment now becomes obvious unsettling and very ugly br br the five sit in a dark cell they are all scheduled to die the next day from here the elements of a christian parable become stronger genuine rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other old master poses of christ are represented he decides he can save everyone if he takes on the guilt for everyone he must be kept alive until morning so he can save everyone he asks the mother for forgiveness and the knowing what is taking place doesn't feel such despair at dying uselessly as he did before br br morning comes the germans don't care if takes on all of the sins of his companions or not they will all be hung they trudge up a inclined street which is a virtual via a bench is taken up to the site of execution which is the gateway to the town five ropes hang from it the bench only stands three so stands on a tree stump which kicks out from under him they all are hung br br as descend the road with the germans someone in the crowd calls him a judas an unnecessary allusion only misstep imagines several times being shot in the back trying to escape dying an honorable death and tries unsuccessfully to hang himself in the but leaves with the germans as the beaten dog he is however if was morally right to go back and save life is he wrong to try to save his own life
<START> of course really experienced reviewers who like stuff like star wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it but really it is enjoyable teen comedy with an awesome story and good acting br br josie gellar played well by drew barrymore is part of a news reporting team and she has been offered a 'real' job she has to go back to school and find out what teens are like these days well this goes alright until josie remembers her horrible time at high school and gets freaked out but she's never been hip never been cool never been popular until now br br sit back relax and enjoy with never been kissed br br
<START> most critics seem to have dismissed this film like so many other charles bronson vehicles as just another patchwork of mindless violence and while there is a fair amount of mayhem death wish 3 is not that awful of an effort particularly for fans of the series and its star br br this time out aging charlie's paul is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of new york city the trigger happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory where he once again becomes a one man army in an urban war of good versus evil bronson at least the older version is truly at his best br br i'm not saying death wish 3 is a classic indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections the characters are generally made of cardboard the violence is over the top a man well into his 60s outruns and dozens of young punks but in the tradition of the original death wish and later films such as falling down with michael douglas it has a definite crowd pleasing charm who doesn't want to see gangbangers get their due there are also some great cheesy moments and one liners so common in 1980s films when a tenant of his apartment building sees setting up a booby trap for instance the vigilante lightheartedly says he's thinning the herd a line only bronson can truly make work br br so you see the key to enjoying death wish 3 is to accept it for what it is it ain't spielberg and it ain't art so throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it
<START> many times the description full of sound and fury signifying nothing is used and is right on target unfortunately code 46 lacks both sound and fury a bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated tim robbins character william is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with maria samantha morton seems almost absurd these folks are so passionless that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with thorazine there is a brave new world sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2 3 stops overexposed unfortunately this technique gets tedious and rather hard on the eyes the cutesy mishmash of languages also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence many futuristic scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance this film has neither flash nor substance its a code 6 all the way
<START> the title pretty much lets you know what you're getting it's a grade c howler but not as blatantly funny as i was hoping directed by exploitation film specialist eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan demme long before directing silence of the lambs and philadelphia this low budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the philippines but set in some anonymous third world country playing hooker and small time drug dealer lee daniels blaxploitation superstar pam grier plays the first half of the title role while long forgotten margaret markov is the other half karen brent an unlikely patty hearst like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government naturally antagonistic toward each other they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini skirts as uniforms run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half hearted cat fighting as lee and karen are pitted against each other of course they escape but shackled together a la the defiant ones and continue the cat fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits br br meanwhile various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit the loutish drug lord looking for lee who stole from him the rather passive revolutionaries looking for karen and the incompetent police who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord needless to say everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of filipino women a dog wears karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion one beer bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face there is a rather sad ending but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise sadly grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the jive while markov is an amazonian blonde whom i am convinced is trying desperately to be credible since no one displays any talent for acting the rest of the cast is not worth noting except balding bug eyed sid haig who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord the 2003 dvd contains only the original trailer as an extra
<START> strikes me as routine as far as tv movies go i can believe that it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills br br for instance good old john ritter now a rather bulky and bearded villain poisons his wife enough to make her ill then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately fourteen years pass before the story picks up again why fourteen years i would guess that though the narrative doesn't demand it history does br br some of the particular scenes however are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer pawing through her attic ritter's first wife stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black and white flashbacks with stings on the score suddenly she recalls when fourteen years ago she discovered ritter shaving from a rectifier carefully collecting them and putting them in her shampoo and her liner or whatever it's called later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well br br frankly i don't believe it i don't believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that ritter put into her shampoo or eyeliner is referred to in the movie as a toxic metal and i suppose it is in sufficient quantity but it's also an anti that's sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed someone will have to demonstrate as no one does in this movie that it is a topical poison many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed so how come some in her shampoo gives immediate and drastic headaches and her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup i think the anthropologist e b called this simple minded idea sympathetic magic but i'm not sure br br mais je anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return circumstantial evidence piles up against ritter who plays the villain with all the stops out when his first trial is dismissed he smirks at who has prompted the investigation br br you see was good friends with ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner i'll bet and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in ritter's marital schedule sure the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective lawrence dane everyone else acts by the numbers they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing but dane does little things that are original i'm told you want to report a murder long pause while he sits down and waits then abruptly thrusts his face towards and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice so who was murdered i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life i mean what the heck ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and character is dead so who is to object i wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals let me see cyanide a massive dose of and maybe something else that i was confused by it all not that i was rooting for ritter here's a mathematician with a ph d who insists people call him doctor he even corrects people who address him merely as professor most ph d s get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly call me whitey even though i know how to get a standard deviation and you don't average tv fare
<START> i'm sorry but i cannot even partly agree with some comments on this awful piece of sh br br english is not my native language because i'm a german citizen so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammar structures or something gg i cannot understand why this movie got such a high rating 6 3 are you kidding me this movie has completely no sense not even a seem of good acting br br when i looked at the comments on the da vinci code which has i think nearly the same rating i had to bang my head on the table because i watched 00 schneider directly after and oh my god there are worlds between them br br the majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 6 3 and helge as a genius of course he knows how to make money but i think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact that german isn't your native language and you just ignore or rather don't notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences ok i must confess that some scenes are funny but all in all a 6 3 is just too much for my
<START> this is one odd film it seems to be aimed at a younger audience but is filled with sexual innuendos the whole premise is rather absurd not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far fetched but then again the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line br br the cast are good though meg foster plays a very butch mafia like leader with the handsome a j as the leader of the bullies egan and rebecca are well cast as the young lovers though for a comic actress of her talent leigh allyn baker is notoriously wasted in this film br br overall the film is unusual but i don't think that is enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution the scenery is all rather dull and the special effects quite dismal sit this one out unless your in the mood
<START> lucille ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s but she still made an occasional film most notably the long long trailer and the facts of life although her television career remained strong as the 1970s began her movie career seemed to be winding down but ball was determined to have one last big screen fling and the project she selected was the 1966 musical mame br br in many respects the role seemed tailor made based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different broadway plays mame dennis is a wacky wildly uninhibited woman who inherits her orphaned nephew patrick and leads him on a wild tour of life's possibilities bouncing from one comic spree to another the music which featured such songs as open a new window and if he walked into my life today was among jerry herman's best work the supporting cast which included robert preston and bea arthur was the best of the best expectations were high opening night fanfare was tremendous the film was a disaster critics were aghast and audiences sat slack jawed br br no matter what hardcore lucy fans may say mame is a fiasco so much so that it is hard to know where to start it is badly directed badly filmed badly performed and there lucille ball is at the center of it all unable to dance unable to sing and grinning like a waxworks dummy while incredibly bad choreography swirls around her but the disaster is hardly of her making alone the supporting cast fares no better bea arthur and jane recreate their stage roles of vera charles and agnes the former is stagey the latter is dismal robert preston manages to sing with a smile but he's pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it br br the dvd brings the film from the vhs pan and scan release to widescreen but that only means there's more awfulness to see everybody loves lucy but only the least critical fan could love lucy's mame while i wouldn't say it's bad enough to make you want to gouge your eyes out you may wish you had not recommended br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> chuck jones's so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor the historically important but lacklustre 'fast and furry while it features several predictable gags also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences chief among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights there's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket powered roller skates also sees a great improvement in the representation of wile e coyote not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in 'fast and furry but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain although it's a little slow to get going too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags once arrives at the mine shaft sequence it's clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are better road runner cartoons than but there's a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario
<START> everything i can say is that it's one of the best documentary movies of the ocean ever seen it impresses immensely by professional filming scenery and idea what i've seen during those 50 minutes cannot be compared to any other visions of the blue planet
<START> i play final fantasy 7 and this movie is excellent like the game all fans of final fantasy will love this movie br br the music are fantastic and the history is good but the best of this movie is the visual effects are amazing the characters are equal to the game and that detail are good for the fans br br you don't need play the game to like this movie all the people can enjoy the film because the history is some different and is easy to understand i buy the dvd because is excellent is 100 advisable if you don't see this film what you waiting for believe me you will fascinate like me
