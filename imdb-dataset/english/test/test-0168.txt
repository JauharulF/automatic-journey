<START> shuttle is an indie thriller about four young adults who get a ride late one night on a shuttle bus from the airport to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath br br although some of the sequences of scares and it's unconventionally interesting plot work some aspects just don't the bad dialogue and unlikeable characters gives a good reason to not care for them but often the suspense works and asks you the question of what would you do and usually what you would do isn't what these idiots on the shuttle do br br if you're expecting a mindless bloody horror film you'll be mistaken this is a film that causes you to use your mind but unfortunately not until the end br br four out of ten
<START> this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 in fact it is now more available with two other medium sized silent chaplin features a dog's life and the pilgrim that chaplin re released in the 1950s in it's day shoulder arms was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach it still is very funny chaplin in disguise as a tree spying on the germans is so ridiculous it's hysterical but it suffers from being set in it's own age charlie's dealing with world war i a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people but not the worst war horrible to say of the 20th century chaplin would live to see that war too and would spoof it's main architects in the great dictator but the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture also hitler as a target seems more important to audiences in 2008 than kaiser wilhelm ii and his general staff br br shoulder arms was to take us through the drafting of the tramp his training his getting use to trench warfare and his actual fighting against the huns on the western front much of this is now gone one segment when albert austin is a doctor examining chaplin in his office at the draft center is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary unknown chaplin this is unfortunate because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out what remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more and feeling a trifle cheated br br sydney chaplin and henry bergman do well in supporting parts especially sydney as wilhelm he had done it before in a short with charlie for the sale of bonds giving a militaristic speech before being clobbered by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled war bonds here we see the tramp succeed in capturing wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion it was only topped by stan and ollie capturing the german army with a tank and barbed wire in pack up your troubles br br the funny thing is that chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities he was not a naturalized american not in 1917 or in 1952 when attorney general publicly announced that chaplin could not return to the u s because he was an enemy alien chaplin and his family were in europe on a trip in anger charlie settled in switzerland for the rest of his life except when he made a countess from hong kong and when he went to hollywood for his special career oscar in the 1970s because he was not an american he could not be drafted by the u s so he sold with douglas fairbanks sr and mary pickford u s war bonds but in great britain tens of thousands had perished in world war one battlefields and the public there was upset at chaplin who they considered a slacker and a coward chaplin eventually did overcome this but remnants of the resentment followed him until he died this does not detract from the success of shoulder arms as a film but it does suggest why chaplin did not do another modern war film until 1940 and a target
<START> well the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected it's not boring and it's not unoriginal it's really not a silly romantic comedy the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual of course we're still talking about a movie but the main characters are indeed plausible donald is of course an exaggeration but he's just a pawn in the movie a means to prove something the ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy always the same moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre i genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies it's worth a watch besides it's better directed than other movies the story line always stands up the characters themselves stand up and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact yada yada at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all the movie makes you feel something you may even learn a thing or two it's not the usual hope producing tissue idiocy it's a good movie not a consolation prize for teary women around the world
<START> so i caught this one afternoon as what lies above and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising the heroine diana pennington is a mountain climbing expert but that doesn't help her when her fiancÃ© brian gets hurt on a climb when she goes off to get help and returns he disappears from the mountain never to be seen again br br two years later diana is still a climber but she won't go near snowman's pass that is until curt seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancÃ© with a new satellite program she agrees and they take off up the mountain with two assistants his bodyguard hugo and the computer whiz tyler from the start you know that there's some ulterior motive going on but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie br br the major disappointments are the red herrings most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition the object from the sky that fell into the mountains which turns out to be not so supernatural the story of how snowman's pass came to be and the most memorable one of them all diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie but what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball the majority of the movie revolves around the search for brian that's why i can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie this was the major plot this was how the movie started how do you not wrap that up br br i wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one
<START> this is the battlefield earth of mini series it has with a few exceptions all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director in this case they are the same person who clearly don't know what they are doing they have both a messiah wannabe that don't really deliver as a hero played in this case by a guy that looks like mark hamill but sadly the force is not with him and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some often badly made computer animation the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who don't even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted battlefield earth mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic the fifth element 's fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made silly moments to remember 1 every scene with the guild guys who looks like mst3k's observer guys but with silly hats 2 shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress why was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner with matching silly hat together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats 3 paul the stand up comedian 4 baron in over acting overdrive screaming i m alive 5 every scene with the backdrop because it newer fits the foreground 6 every scene with the fake religious specially the water of life 7 the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away

<START> my friends and i rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about we all thought it would be like a canadian american pie but when we watched it we were completely surprised we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it it was nothing like american pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end after that night it became my favorite movie for not only it's plot but the actors and the great writing there wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable everything is very realistic and relate able for anybody living in a small town with little prospects i absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance it's worth it
<START> it's difficult to criticize a movie with the title like the bed that and involves a ghost narrator who's trapped behind a 2 way painting he drew and a bed that and Â if i'm not mistaken masturbates now that's getting back at its human companions furthermore it up in orange for whatever reason to absorb lying on its surface including apples wine fried chicken and of course people again it's suffice to say that don't expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid Â the final remains of anything that orange suds takes Â dissolving only certain things it'll drink the wine but the okay and it'll eat away at the chicken bone but the just fine heck the bed even replaces the unused containers hilariously at one point it downs pepto bismol i had to laugh at that one i don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously it's low budget and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money i thought in a world where there can be a killer and a 'blood beach ' this might be amusing to watch for reasons that might involve cost 90 of the film is voice over no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright confusion on why a bed would attack i can think of one Â and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief a victim loses all flesh on his hands barely saying ow only one scene that went on too long was minutely tense Â a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back using a sheet where are the mst3k guys
<START> when jean seduces the young gardener for the sole purpose of annoying her husband little does she realise the explosive drama that is to follow br br the short scenario does not waste a word or a frame in this brief interlude in the day of a dysfunctional family the lives of the father mother and son are all linked in some way with the gardener it's this fact that makes the script so intriguing br br for such a short film the production is every bit as professional as any major work and the casting is ideal br br a wonderful little film that can guarantee a few laughs from beginning to end
<START> i love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending this movie could be considered a drama bout two characters realizing true love but the story's so touching and so sweet that in my mind its a romance granted the acting is not so great thats y i didn't give it a 10 but they do the job and they don't overact thank god plus they're cute but the story's powerful and just plain adorable some of u pansies will choke up its a great watch for a love story but if ur homophobic stay away for everyone else i loved the movie its soo sweet i felt its a brokeback on a smaller scale but with a happy ending so enjoy
<START> saw this movie and totally loved it the characters are great it is definitely my kind of movie you do not get bored in this movie i love independent films they are so much more rewarding my husband and i really enjoyed jay's style if you are an open minded person who loves thought provoking films and loves conversation after it's over you will love this film it is definitely thought provoking the film definitely will step on some toes but who cares those people will probably not go to see this movie it is amazing to see the characters evolve jay floyd has really captured both sides of the table applause applause jay i hope you are working on another movie
<START> i really don't understand who this movie is aimed at from just the absurdity of it not to mention the ridiculously bad acting cheesy dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child i'd assume this was meant to be a children's movie but i think there may be more swear words than pulp fiction not to mention constant references to drugs and general mayhem and killing so which demographic is it trying to please this movie is too schizophrenic like trying to combine country music with heavy metal in the end no one is going to like it because it's a bloody paradox i would recommend this movie because it's so funny in a bad way except the actors are so patently unbearable that i wouldn't want to suggest otherwise br br i'm completely serious when i say that i could not watch more than 15 minutes of this
<START> i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four years old i had half day kindergarten and this was on wpix channel 11 in the afternoon i just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing br br i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child i of course stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out no vcr's or back then i grew up not realizing that the show was still on until i was in 11th grade br br i also had no idea that there are dvd's and wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show but now they're all past the demographic or i'd buy all of them dvd sets this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today
<START> this is one of the century's best tv series ever with all the great suspense story and a cast of absolutely fantastic actors and love and grief that really gets you involved and captivated in front of your tv if you have seen it once you will go back to see it again i have several times and still do it the 20 th century's best drama
<START> i've expected a comedy about the nva but this is a parody it shows the national army of eastern germany in a light that is not appropriate and definitely not true br br one can make a comedy about everything as long as the underlying facts are not changed even a comedy about the german is possible as roberto benigni with life is beautiful has shown br br the movie nva would be an ok comedy because the jokes in it are overall ok nothing special not hilarious but enough to live with it br br the point is that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the nva a death machine that was ready to attack western europe along with it's friend the red army an institution that used everything to get the utmost from it's soldiers an army that marched into the in 1968 and was ready to march also in poland to destroy the you can't make a movie without showing the tiniest bit of evil or would you make a parody about a guantanamo or 9 11 showing osama bin laden as a funny screwed guy 90 minutes about a funny osama in a afghan taliban camp where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the nva
