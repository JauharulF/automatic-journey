<START> the only people i would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf although i'm sure a would get a kick out of it this film had nothing no acting terrible music awful script only the power to suck any happiness from your soul you may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer inanity and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself firstly i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable secondly i only made it without gnawing off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow the problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes and that was a fatal error on my behalf i normally like films to leave you with something by the end but all this did was take for the sake of your sanity do not watch this film
<START> but a great cast jonathan pryce kathy bates rupert everett lynne redgrave julie andrews and dan aykroyd and that's just the beginning br br i'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone death singing a sparkly suit cell phones a little person nice looking woman actually a modern not medieval a boombox and a crossbow oh and a psychotic and barry manilow br br you will have to trust me when i say that 50 of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your dna makeup it's not your fault it's hereditary the other 50 of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes but you have to keep watching br br even at that at the end you may wonder why you watched but keep in mind that absurdity thing it should grow on you it is a test
<START> opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by theodor and a good not great performance by jannings as henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work henny chews the scenery as anne br br it's all very beautiful but it's all surface and no depth the melodramatic tale of a woman wronged made it a hit in america where the expressionistic the cabinet of dr caligari flopped in the same year 1920 proving that what is popular is not what endures lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies not sterile spectacles like this
<START> this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see br br it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and like an h g welles story i can't quite recall may live to want back br br keep in mind that this is a short very short it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring bang it's over and believe me the 'punch line' is one you will remember br br i'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy of that i am sure
<START> i guess melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool it has the cool approach of the late '60s early '70s same discrete quirkiness le rouge a bitter and story is also the playground of delon and montand in defining roles br br is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine delon is a hoodlum montand is a sick failed cop plays an escaped suspect le rouge is of course far above a heist movie melville uses his techniques wordless detailed depictions of every step of the heist etc yet this particular action drama is far better than his other it's very unlikely them by being so much better the look of le rouge is very peculiar to melville very br br delon was sharp and cool brings his craft and montand makes maybe the finest role of this movie his performance has an unexpected warmth br br on the other hand the characters are barely sketched no more than strictly necessary and are personae or masks yet the portrayal is inspired economic but suggestive br br another of the movies that prove delon to be a good a very good actor and the fact that he's not a genius does not imply that he ought to be despised as a fourth rate actor he's good he can bear the proximity of a and montand br br only ten yrs before le rouge melville was doing towards the end of the '50s a boring overlong insipid noir pastiche starring himself Âand after only a decade here he is in full form with this quite amazing action drama stylistically it's a success br br before seeing le rouge i was not a fan now i guess i rather am one br br le rouge is a an action drama one of the most genres melville scores
<START> we are in a small town a homely widow ida lupino hires a handyman robert ryan to look after her house she soon starts to regret it as ryan grows erratic by the hour it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic and now she is unable to escape her house br br beware my lovely is adapted from mel the spiral staircase story and play called the man pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness one however shouldn't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture because it isn't it's clear from the get go that ryan's howard wilton is a dangerously troubled man but this is a different sort of peril movie one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist br br ryan and lupino are a great combination they had also done the excellent and far better on dangerous ground this same year so with both actors clearly comfortable together it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house re prison ryan is particularly strong as his character in and out of madness with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy the direction from harry horner is safe he in truth doesn't have to do much other than let his actors run with it and george e cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches with one involving christmas tree baubles immensely memorable falling some where in between being average and great beware my lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film noir for fans of robert ryan tho it's something of an essential viewing oh yes and then some 7 10
<START> the further adventures of ma and pa kettle almost seamlessly picks up where the egg and i left off for the first solo adventure of the a new writing team and director is introduced leonard goldstein associate producer of the egg and i was producer of the further adventures of ma and pa kettle with many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the to the works very well there is a reference to ma beating birdie hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt an import scene in the egg and i the prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send tom kettle to college in this movie tom is returning home as a college graduate br br there are two plots intertwined in this movie one is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house the other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up br br pa kettle percy wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest and ended up winning a house his disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit when pa plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion never in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him he played the part to perfection in his autobiography jack benny mentioned how impressed he was with percy deadpan delivery took that comedic device to a high level of perfection br br ma marjorie main and pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse ma and pa almost as much as they help them ma adapts far more quickly than pa included with the modern conveniences is a television a very new household item in 1949 moving walls hidden beds and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props but the attention is on ma and pa never the props themselves br br tom kettle richard long meets kim parker meg randall a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults tom is a bright self made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment this subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes but left to subside it was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie br br seeing the moving out of their run down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves ma was the practical one just as she had been in the the egg and i pa was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy he never felt at home in the new house but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him
<START> flashdance meets meatballs iii or maybe it should just be called meatballs iv this is my friend all time favorite movie largely because he still has a thing about j v cheerleaders as someone once said this is fine more than fine but as you get older you need to branch out whether you want to or not society demands it br br gimme an f has cinema's greatest j v cheerleader mary ann played by beth miller who looks like a sweet faced alicia silverstone from before her clueless days wesley hates miller's other film the horrific teen wolf too made three years later where she plays a fickle southern belle much like martha smith's character in animal house personally i admire miller's range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both br br anyway mary ann is a naÃ¯ve novice cheerleader from a member of the lucky ducks squad who comes to camp for cheerleading instruction she's befriended by jenna karen lee kelly the leader of the tough girl squad appropriately named the demons jenna becomes protective of mary ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to mary ann br br later mary ann gets a crush on tommy hamilton the head instructor tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing phoebe daphne is tommy's long suffering girlfriend she has a well adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective she even tolerates tommy's flirtation with mary ann trusting that tommy will not actually take advantage of young mary ann br br while these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with which is a shame because had they brought some actual comic relief to the production it would have been a decent film jennifer cooke plays pam a social climbing and terminally peppy instructor who is carrying on with camp's money hungry owner and there is another couple with a thing for the characters from mad max since nothing is very funny you are left with only a cute semi romance and some great dance routines br br an attempt is made to create some suspense by slowly leading up a final competition but unless this is your first movie experience the outcome is never in doubt and there is a back story about some japanese businessmen wants to get money from but it goes nowhere dramatically or comically br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> very serious spoilers br br this movie was a huge disappointment there are so many problems i dont know where to start so i'll talk about what is good about the film br br the cast was great steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged upper class uptight white guy queen latifah plays a big beautiful urban black gal and eugene levy well he pretty much plays himself add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well and if watching these guys for 1 75 hours is worth 8 to you then you wont be disappointed br br but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone all the white people are uptight bigots all the black people are ghetto ebonics speakers the blacks are hip cool with it and poor the whites are nerds stiff and rich except eugene levy he is clearly taken with queen and speaks the lingo so nicknames him a freak so if you're a white man and you like black women and you know street slang you must be a freak the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs br br putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy character she comes to martin's home under false pretense but martin takes a liking to her anyway she's supposed to be wrongly accused of robbery martin takes up her cause 3 4 of the way through the film we find out character escaped from jail so our sympathy for her goes out the window br br there is no real plot the movie plods along from scene to scene with showing up in some place where she's not supposed to be like a country club or martin's house and martin trying to hide her thats the running gag then in the last minutes of the film they decide that they're going to finally deal with assertion that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery martin goes under cover as a homeboy to extract a let's face it unusable confession from ex boyfriend and everyone lives happily ever after br br finally but there is a lot more wrong with this flick this movie appears to be a hodge podge of clips from other movies the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin movie the house sitter where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes up his stodgy middle class life martin and meet online ala got mail the whole quirky nanny fixes rich man's life goes as far back as the sound of music and mary poppins br br i wouldnt see this movie again for free
<START> one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those amicus anthology movies add the beast in the cellar to the list br br much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film it does open with a fairly good hook but after that we re treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk correct me if i m wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the cellar is the anti smoking stance some people have mentioned that this is an anti war or anti military film but watch carefully and you ll see that everytime a lights up for a fly puff he gets killed rather strange considering attitudes to smoking t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays
<START> jack brooks' quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie br br i found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super tedious wait br br the climax can't begin to make up for all the setup time br br normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but the fact that the wait time before action index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development br br not so br br while not without its initial charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappoints br br wish i could get all that setup time back to it into something that pays off
<START> despite its new york setting new york characters 'summer in the city' is not an american movie it is better than that what is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres director shows a deft touch in combining comedy with tragedy pathos with drama br br the secret of success appears to be a of great characters each could have their own film built around them and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie ranging from bai ling to ornella muti robert burke to peter stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in hollywood pictures even sandra bernhard is funny here br br an added bonus cream on the substantial cake is john cale's soundtrack
<START> some people think this was a rather bad tv series with cheesy effects considering it was filmed between 1977 1979 but really look back at those years and think we didn't have computers back then so if you think about it it's a rather good tv series br br i always figured bad ratings killed the show but no the network did they canceled out their theme as the superhero network and abandoned a short lived spider man series if it had gone on it probably would have run well into the 80's and if it was really lucky and i mean really lucky the early 90s br br and no one wanted to pick this series up br br anyways jolly old or young nicholas hammond of the sound of music fame is brought to the tv screen as peter parker the secret identity of the amazing spider man along the series peter deals with a clone a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician br br while the series is way out of timeline being that peter is already graduated from university and thats when he gets bit and uncle ben is already dead the audience is treated to action suspense and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego spider man br br while it's also slightly disappointing that robert f simon looks nothing like j j jameson it's not so disappointing that betty grant isn't betty grant but a hot african american girl who reminds me of halle berry who is one of the hottest women on the planet so really this one wasn't so bad br br but considering the time and how much drama they packed into this one it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today either way it's entertaining even for today br br 8 10
<START> there is nothing good to say about this movie read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other writings abbie was often dismissed as the clown prince of the '60's but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness his sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas the media too often concentrated on the man not the ideas and that's the problem with this movie too later in his life he did suffer from depression but this flick is like a national enquirer version of abbie he deserves better if you don't know abbie or his times this movie won't help br br this film lies i give it a zero br br
<START> there are good movies and there are bad movies and then there's moscow zero a film so utterly bad it makes spending a month in solitary with an insurance salesman an attractive entertainment alternative br br with an incomprehensible plot about the gates of hell opening within a labyrinth of tunnels under moscow the film is a mess of repetitive and nonsensical shots of a little girl running through tunnels red lights floating about and strange wall shadows none of which serves to mount any fear or tension but instead elicits the reaction of here they go again with the girl or lights from the viewer br br directed by marÃ­a who for reasons i can only conclude as shame was billed as luna the movie stars vince gallo as owen an american priest who travels to moscow in search of sergei rade serbedzija a friend and colleague who has gone missing in the tunnels he enlists the help of a series of locals who with the exception of are all portrayed by spanish actors trying with limited success to russian accents br br along the way they cross paths with members of some sort of underground leather coated religious mafia headed by a portly val kilmer whose career seems to be in such free fall that he's resorted to appearing in dreck like this and henchman sage stallone sly's son who seems to have been cast merely so the stallone name can be included in the film's marquee br br apart from watching the troupe try to navigate their way through the tunnels with the aid of a comically drawn map and repetitive shots of them being followed or eluded by a pale faced young girl not much else goes on throughout dialogue routinely switches between english and russian with actors frequently taking turns in each language and entire conversations are uttered half in one and half in the other with the only apparent reason being they felt like it adding a frustrating dimension for the viewer over and above trying to figure out the crazily cobbled together story br br about the only thing moscow zero gets right however is its title which could only have rendered a more accurate description of this movie if the word moscow had been omitted
