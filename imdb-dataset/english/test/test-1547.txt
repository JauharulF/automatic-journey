<START> i saw this film some years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent music is endearing and should be given the recognition it richly deserves the cinematography is awesome critics hated it but they hated home alone too i haven't found it on video but welcome anyone who can find a copy
<START> i didn't really care for this had they gotten rid of the comedy slapstick and focused on the dramatic philosophical aspects of the script this might have been worthwhile br br the more the film went on the less i liked the protagonist mailman he does have interesting things to say but he's also a hypocritical insecure jerk br br 3 10
<START> i saw this performance on tv and taped it my daughter played it over and over again i loaned out at work and everyone just loved it it is just brilliant physical comedy bill made an appearance here in california he was working and living in new york and performed the regard of flight on stage i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance br br bill was awarded a federal endowment and my daughter wrote him a letter of congratulations and bill was so kind to write her a note back and a photograph br br people ask me and i can't decide if he is a comedian and actor or a clown actually he is all three i really wish this was on dvd my tape is lost
<START> i watched this series on pbs back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so very atmospheric and creepy sometimes this is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted you are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people the villains are almost laughably evil especially the sheriff of nottingham man i would love to beat the s t out of that snotty little bastard nicholas grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the sheriff his whipping boy sir guy is equally but is also pathetic lots of murder and mayhem in this series along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that nature i noticed it got an award for children's television which is surprising if i had kids i would not let them watch this outstanding use of locations in this show also it is now on dvd so go out and buy it
<START> and again columbia pictures decides to merely make hash using the original version with curly and without any of the gags or jokes to boot toward the end of this pitiful flick when joe gets stuck riding the bull the studio didn't even make much of an effort to re record the sound for if you listen carefully you can still here curly going woo woo woo woo also when moe and larry throw the darts in order to slow the bull down so he can get off that's lifted right from the original because you can actually see moe and larry magically appear 15 years younger why oh why did moe allow all this to happen it's a burning question that probably can never be answered because as far as i know in real life he was quite sensitive to any type of criticism and had rather high standards for his work as also did larry curly and shemp don't waste your time on this one
<START> how this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me the test that postal workers take is so difficult there is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie how they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling i didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid then he tries to start the car without his keys lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all it's just a sad stupid mess i liked the moms dress though br br send it back to sender as soon as possible
<START> yes non can't see what's the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually 'get' it but i plead with you foreigner look at the other crap that's been churned out from singapore and compare it to this film it's like comparing a chunks to a little diamond this film is the first to truly show some the seedy underbelly something the forces that be pretend does not exist and there's a part in the film where a gangster ah beng in our unique colloquial curses in 4 languages namely tamil english malay and well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time the sad thing is that viewers from foreign will have an easier time getting their oily little claws on this gem in its country of origin it was banned initially only to be given and r rating and that too with about 20 cuts to it it's nice to know you that one of the best creative edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain unadulterated uncensored halfway across the world than in your own nation
<START> like another poster mentioned ch 56 a local boston tv station showed this multiple times over the years on saturday afternoons they paired it with the first sequel return of the majin br br now i haven't seen it since then but it never left me aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy technically it isn't horror until the statue comes to life at the end it's just about a village ruled over by an evil man there's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them to no avail but things go too far the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guys but then it starts going after the good guys too well done with some cool special effects at the end loved how he got rid of the main bad guy also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too br br no masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasy horror film worth catching but not if it's the dubbed print
<START> here we've got an intelligent mixture of typical and intelligent filmmaking not that the script has not its big holes and a few are a bit but the cinematography is a optical treat and the soundtrack is first rate the blend of fast and colorful slow sometimes nearly poetic parts has no comparison in its kind of movie so a classification is rather hard the closest genre is a disaster or with deeper human and political notes than usual well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas but i am hoping this for so many other mostly asian movies before and nobody seems to believe me unfortunately
<START> i would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie recalls the offbeat melanie griffith jeff daniels comedy something wild in which a rather eccentric free spirit hooks up with a conservative and very orderly young man and the two pose as a couple and basically her personality gradually has an effect on him he looses up and learns to enjoy their short lived tryst that is exactly what happens here except insert convenient store robbing eccentric alex rosanna arquette in melanie griffith's role and super cautious teen lincoln the name is no coincidence played by devon in jeff daniel's part this movie even shares the same twist and abrupt genre change where the creepy violent boyfriend suddenly shows up in the end and things end up quite badly only here instead of it being ray liotta playing a throwback to 1950s film goons it's peter greene br br the story is about a teenage kid who is in his own little world he has some sort of fascination with death following his brother's suicide and his parents have disconnected too behaving quite strangely the mother is convinced christmas will be arriving shortly despite it being august then on a night out with the guys one of whom is played by jason of the wonder years trying to buy them beer he runs into alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car with his permission of course and they take off for mini adventure across the deserts of the west coast robbing convenient stores in robin hood sort of fashion and of course indulging in the routine self discovery as each asks more about the other's life but alex has left behind a partner in her trade of theft and he isn't going away easily although we're not consistently reminded of him or anything as in repetitive flashback or cutting over to his point of view at least this much was done cleverly br br 'do me a aka trading favors is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self discovery that lags quite a bit for the first half of the film but delivers the goods a little to late once alex and lincoln arrive at her home out in the middle of nowhere by the time the filmmakers give you enough stimulation the film is unfortunately almost over i would recommend that if this is the sort of story you're in the mood for and despite rosanna arquette always giving a good performance even in a poorly written film i would still recommend catching this in its best form something wild
<START> i did not think haggard was the funniest movie of all time i like and viva la bam a lot more i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam or jack ass should see it i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out i think that jonny knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier i think ryan dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more
<START> first of all i've seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porno flicks how bad was chris as ungar on the sopranos chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief and then throw in bobby as one of his vegas cronies it's just too much to take in a dramatic movie neither actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for tony paulie or uncle junior and i want to know who did the makeup for this disaster i want that person to be my make up person over the next 25 years so i'll never age a day either so that's all i'll write on this movie since it's not worth wasting too much more of my time br br yes i do know that michael imperioli and steve are their real names
<START> you are alone is a beautiful almost delicate film smart directed crisply written with two complex and riveting performances and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you br br the story about a highschool girl who drowns her depression and awkwardness by working a few hours a week as a 500 an hour schoolgirl escort and the depressed next door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown new haven hotel features breathtaking performances from both jessica as the girl and richard brundage as her neighbor br br as daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with maggie gyllenhaal in secretary she so captures a teenager's angst of growing into her own skin and when she talks about always being in control you start to realize she's not in control at all but in danger of going over the deep end which i guess in a way she does br br brundage as buddy is depressed angry heartbroken a shell of a man but it isn't until the film's startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of his pain br br after a very brief opening segment which will hook most independent film lovers and have the religious right running towards the exits we are brought into the hotel room at first you're not sure about these people or the film making style shaky annoying like the characters until you realize their back story told in short flashbacks they're confrontational at first for a reason and so is the camera but as they open up as the story settles down likewise so does the camera and i don't know 20 minutes in give or take you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screen br br having just seen the world premiere screening at the brooklyn film fest where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes Â i almost wish the film were already on video so i could watch it again because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film particularly a very candid dialog regarding fantasy and climax i really thought things were going in a very different direction but i realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what i imagined i need to see it again but as dark and sexual as much of the talk is blunt to say the least i found myself laughing more than i might have expected at some of its candor which definitely falls into the things we think but lack the nerve to say out loud category it's very blunt especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning some of it will make you uncomfortable especially if you're watching you are alone with a partner you'll definitely have something to talk about Â perhaps argue about Â afterwards perhaps it should come with a warning you should be alone when watching the music is amazing i would have come home and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if i could have the film looks as good as anything shot on film after the screening director was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good his answer none they couldn't afford it br br i have to give credit i am a big fan of his two shorts the pretty girl and objects in the mirror but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this film br br to everyone involved bravo
<START> tony hawk's pro skater isn't much different at all from the previous games excluding tony hawk 3 the only thing new that is featured in tony hawk's pro skater is the new selection of levels and tweaked out graphics tony hawk's pro skater offers a new career mode and that is the career the career is basically tony hawk 1 career because there is only about five challenges per level if you missed tony hawk 1 and 2 i suggest that you buy tony hawk's pro skater but if you have played the first two games you should still try this one overall there really isn't anything new but it is still very fun to go through the game hopefully this review benefits your needs br br graphics 7 out of 10 overall the clean visuals isn't really one of tony hawk's pro skater main characteristics the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony hawk 1 and 2 and the character models look a little bit improved when you look back to tony hawk's pro skater 1 and 2 on the old ps1 the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head in tony hawk's pro skater the graphics are rendered a lot better the character models are no longer filled with the textures are more smooth but not to the farthest extent tony hawk's pro skater visuals do not compare to tony hawk 3's graphics but activision probably didn't want to make tony hawk's pro skater have extraordinary graphics overall the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the xbox to use in here graphics are nice and clean that's all i have to say br br sound 8 out of 10 the sound effects don't deliver much to the imagination but the skateboards popping off of the ground sound great the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating was because you are not obligated to listen to the below average tony hawk soundtrack because there is a custom soundtrack feature the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony hawk 1 and 2 mainly because it is more clearer and just the fact that everything sounds great one of the main reasons why i bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack the grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did just a little tweaked out one of the major problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is over it will not proceed to the next track the song that you have just listened to will just play over again i don't like the in game soundtrack but like i said you are not obligated to listen to it br br controls 10 out of 10 the controls are the best part of tony hawk's pro skater the control set up is marvelously comfortable and easy to get used to back in the playstation days people thought that the controls were the best ever but it looks like has done a better job with the xbox control surprisingly it is very easy to use the control stick to execute tricks activision has done great work with tony hawk's pro skater controls they have made the xbox controller the best for tony hawk games you will not be disappointed with the control style and that is a guarantee br br game play 10 out of 10 excluding the fact that tony hawk's pro skater is basically tony hawk 1 and 2 put together the game play is still unbelievably fun the game play factor has been changed around a bit this time you get a lot more air than in the first two games and it is a lot easier to perform tricks in tony hawk's pro skater each character has three career modes consisting of tony hawk 1 career tony hawk 2 career and the career tony hawk 1 career is rather easy because in the first game you get nothing for air the tony hawk 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version did the only amount of difficulty that applies to the career is finding out where all items are but after you've done that career is no hard at all in the career there is a total of 3 levels and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes collecting s k a t e and doing whatever else is required for that particular level the third level out of the three is the competition level where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold in the first two levels the secret tapes and collecting the letters s k a t e are featured in both of them overall tony hawk's pro skater still maintains the old tony hawk's pro skater vibe br br story br br fun factor 10 out of 10 tony hawk's pro skater is by far the most funnest game on xbox today i have played tony hawk's pro skater 1 and 2 and back then i didn't like them but for some reason tony hawk's pro skater is really fun there really isn't much to say except that tony hawk's pro skater is by far the best game on xbox today one problem is that if you've already gone through the game once you will play it a couple more times but it will be repetitive br br replay value 10 out of 10 tony hawk's pro skater delivers a high amount of replay value there is a lot of cheats to unlock and a lot of character videos overall tony hawk's pro skater has lots of replay value mainly because it is so fun br br best feature you are not obligated to listen to the crappy in game soundtrack worst feature the custom soundtrack is a bit messed up br br final statement lots of people have complained in the past that they didn't like tony hawk's pro skater because there is nothing new but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for 50 00 br br graphics 7 out of 10 sound 8 out of 10 control 10 out of 10 game play 10 out of 10 story n a fun factor 10 out of 10 br br overall score 9 out of 10
