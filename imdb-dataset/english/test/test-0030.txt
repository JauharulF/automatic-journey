<START> the plot was not good br br the special effects weren't br br the acting was not very good at all br br like others i felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly well a space shuttle through br br i thought the ending was rather unbelievable br br by the way guys about the blow torch in space br br blow torches have their own supply of oxygen hence the name oxy acetylene torch two hoses run from the torch one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle br br so a blow torch would work just fine in space
<START> i have to admit that i am disappointed after seeing this movie i had expected so much more from the trailers the movie was absolutely horrible it lacked a real story line and the acting was not exactly the best don't waste your time the movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is i would have to say that i don't usually write anything about movies on imdb in fact this is my first one but this movie was such a disappointment that i registered just to let people know not to waste their time or money the story line is that of a heist that is to happen and it looks like it had potential to be good but the things that happen in the movie are a little far fetched to be believable watch another movie instead maybe the inside man
<START> is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs circa 1987 it tells three stories in parallel about how opium is grown in north east pakistan how drugs are smuggled from pakistan into europe and finally how people addicted to drugs spiral out of control all three stories are told realistically and with empathy you see enough of the characters lives to understand how ordinary people can get sucked into a life that is really immoral br br these aren't card board cutouts the opium grower is trying to feed his family in a dry area filled with guns and other opium growers the drug smuggler is a rich german with no heart but his wife one of the three main characters is just an ordinary woman who has to choose between leading her life the old way or giving up finally the main character the government minister has the toughest role as he must deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter she slips into the world of drug addiction and starts stealing suffering from ill health attacking her parents emotionally all so she can continue to satisfy her craving for the drug heroin that is destroying her life br br is one of the best dramas i have ever seen on tv the scenes in this show will remain with you for a long long time highly recommended colin
<START> i kept waiting for this film to improve but this is the worst kind of escapist movie a spun sugar confection that sinks under the weight of its own ponderous self importance the pace stumbles on like a legionnaire stranded in the sahara the absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with little to do other than look good in white linen irons plays yet another moneyed charmer who's had a touch of the sun is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress luckily the script does not often call on her to emote away from the jazz club microphone all the enviably relaxed pretty unnecessary characters take turns masticating the scenery with an air of weary sophistication the whole exercise comes across like an interminably long ralph lauren ad br br if you're past forty and believe is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette well if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for appreciating godard's leaden de l'amour and you may even have sat through le divorce without cringing
<START> 20 years ago dr chopper yes he is driving a chopper as well as chopping people up disappeared when the police found dead bodies at his clinic since then people have been disappearing around lake or something and dead bodies parts of bodies has been found all over the place turns out dr chopper needs body parts to stay alive and has been taking them from strangers like pair of lesbians and 5 sorority girls on their initiation you get the picture traveling through lake when a bunch of teenagers decide to go camping they are bound to clash with the doctor br br well if you wanna waste some time this is the right choice acting varies from really bad to mediocre with the girls tripping and falling all the time for no apparent reason every chance of showing skin is taken but without actually showing anything at all the same goes for the special effects who are pretty pathetic with every slash filmed in an angle so you cant see it but there are a lot of body parts in the movie all drenched in blood probably to cover up how sad they really look the plot is pretty faulty and dialog rather sad only time i laughed was when dr chopper said howdy when trying to be scary don't watch this one if your not a freak even then i would recommend you to watch something better
<START> this was a first feature for clinton i was there while he shot this mess back in adelaide around 98 br br although i wasn't involved directly in the production i was witness to the typically delusional behavior post set that went down the parties the drugs the illusionary glamor really an example of what not to do when making a film but also a byproduct of young talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame worldly position br br i like clinton we had a curious friendship he deserves to have another crack with a more mature script there the problems lay and i'm sure a much better job will be done if there's a next time round because frankly he certainly didn't do himself any favours with this on his cv and neither did the cast but hey it was a paying job in country where actors regularly starve to death br br in summary fascinating to watch 'the making of' basically not so much fun to experience alas
<START> this movies shook my will to live why this abomination isn't the bottom 100 list i don't know br br my life was saved by the healing power of danny trejo br br worst movie ever i dare you watch it's like a 90 minute collect calling commercial only much much worse i rather watch the blue screen it's that bad really
<START> the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters' adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be like them br br as tony leung said in the film love just happens there doesn't need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enough br br i had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar wei's work is wasted on the local audience
<START> this movie was disappointing after 15 years when it was brought back to mind from reviewing some info about mariel hemingway all the regrets i felt about the movie came rolling back while i remember peter o'toole i was entirely oblivious to the fact that the female lead okay she was little more than an object for discussion in the storyline was ms hemingway i saw this movie back in the days when i wrote movie reviews and warned people off it as the stories just didn't work and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out still hasn't made sense of the flow of the ideas br br part of this may have to do with the fact that it looked like after the original movie whatever it was about was filmed an editor came in and tried to piece together something out of it i don't know if this had been a project of a previous studio boss and so was sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor or this was a disaster from the original screenplay that attempts to salvage were unsuccessful the theatrical version just didn't work
<START> i think every critic who panned tommy boy when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all every critic panned chris farley and david spade's movies yes coneheads was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and black sheep i agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made but tommy boy does not fall in the category of coneheads which could have been a little funnier and black sheep which is a piece of tripe it is very funny and entertaining i do agree with the critics that chris farley was no john belushi or john candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but chris farley was very funny and i wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no john belushi or john candy but he was very funny the scenes between farley and spade as nemesis are side splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious it is very sad that chris farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like tommy boy to remember how truly funny he was tommy boy is one of the 1990's best comedies
<START> whoever saddled this piece of drek with a title like riddle deserves some kind of award there are dozens of riddles here like who conceived such a dire project who funded it who cast it who persuaded vanessa redgrave to share even one scene with vinnie jones and so on the most sane voice connected to the whole belongs to the person who decided very very wisely that this was unreleasable and not even good enough to go straight to video dvd which throws up yet one more riddle why if we rule out serious did the mail on sunday get involved and deign to give it away this has golden turkey written all over it and smacks of being shot in two days in somebody's garage and cobbled on to some library footage of london except somehow you know that someone actually did shoot this on location when it would have been kinder to shoot him herself vinnie jones and julie cox are not even cardboard cutouts more like tissue paper and i swear pete and kate moss couldn't have done worse whilst derek jacobi is a grotesque joke and the plot moves with the speed of the irish team sliding up the cresta run apart from that
<START> the above line sums it up pretty good the best assets of the comics are it's visual gags and word jokes the latter of which are almost impossible to translate which is why the comics are at their best in their original language br br both are quite hard to capture in film which is why those will never be as good as the comics movies are simply a different medium than comics with that in mind this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic br br the word gags are bearable and sometimes even funny does an amelie reference i have to mention that i watched the french version if you don't watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles the word jokes will probably suck br br the slapstick is okay as well it's a very simple form of humor and not really funny when you're older than twelve but it captures the spirit of the the other visual jokes are the movie's saving grace for the older audience as their often quite funny br br the acting is totally over the top but again that's not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the only depardieu and clavier don't really overact which might be the reason some people think they didn't enjoy their roles i didn't notice a thing on the other hand and especially claude rich turn overacting into an it's actually fun to watch again i fear it wouldn't be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed br br overall not a bad movie at all much better than the previous one it's not a classic and it doesn't dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie but it's still worth seeing the french version that is 7 10
<START> that's what i kept asking myself while watching this film i mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of storyline really i just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie but i persisted i persisted in the hope that maybe the storyline would get better that there might be a good twist at the end however i couldn't have been more wrong in the end i persisted because i figured i could write a bad review for it if anything after watching it br br i mean don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with beautiful sexy and vibrant women but when the director only shows that along with a shitty story thinking it's what the viewer wants to see it insults us all to think we are all so shallow to only want to see burlesque from rep big movie industry players is preposterous my advice hire a different movie
<START> the unthinkable has happened having first witnessed it a few years ago i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called island a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones i'm not making this up it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on like new schools or cancer treating drugs however for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump guest house paradiso to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch br br based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show bottom this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable richard is a hotel manager as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action his buddy eddie director adrian is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff top next to a nuclear power station between them they indulge in cartoony violence with sound effects at regular intervals steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all the plot such as it is involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina vincent cassel who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso much to the astonishment of richie and eddie and that's it br br i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy we've had films like trainspotting 28 days later four weddings and a funeral and the brilliant shaun of the dead also starring simon pegg but this this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle guest house paradiso is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it i kept watching waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came just an endless stream of trapped knob gags unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk come the first ad break it was on tv you see and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you my readers kept me going i'm watching this so they don't have to became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force fed dog food br br trust me i used to love the bottom tv show the combination of suitably grubby acting from and with ott juvenile humour worked for half an hour every week certainly not for an hour and a half as and indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience honestly this makes mayall's drop dead fred seem like the godfather and should you happen to meet either of these two people who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region they'd probably enjoy it pegg and bill nighy both as guests at the hotel are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived and should not be so lucky the movie equivalent of and should be avoided as such
