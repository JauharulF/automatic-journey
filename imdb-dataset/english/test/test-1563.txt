<START> the movie starts with a spiderman spoof which is your introduction to rick riker played by drake bell of drake josh fame personally i'd have given the movie to josh who is much funnier and the rick joke is lifted right out of airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film rick's class is on a science trip to the amalgamated genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film brent spiner data in star trek tng playing dr strom rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from br br we meet our next big star names at rick's home his aunt lucille marion ross of happy days fame uncle albert leslie nielson of airplane police squad naked gun fame and we're introduced to carlson on the amalgamated board of directors dan from the simpsons who is then very promptly killed we're told rick has slept for 5 days get some cheap crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention the stephen hawking scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny br br we get another spiderman spoof rick catching the girl and all the planets but the movie should end right there as jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead you get to see rick's 1st powers emerge gripping ability speed then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong we also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed we get a flashback and a batman spoof in which we discover rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents spoofing spiderman again uncle is shot with jeffrey tambor from hellboy playing the hospital doctor we then get an x men spoof done very badly as patrick stewart is about as white as they come barry bonds is played by yet another lookalike br br we meet invisible girl played by pamela anderson looking stunning in her costume 1st outing in his costume once he fixes his ability to see breath through it is another batman spoof the tom cruise youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike and not a very good one at that there are lots of modern references like youtube facebook wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day there's a very weak gay joke never a good idea to do those either when jill is helping aunt lucille make thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isn't very funny just infantile br br the aunt farting scene isn't particularly funny just incredibly childish anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12 she's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of at her funeral and the even worse cremation joke br br we get the 2 worst in the whole movie prince charles nelson mandela at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is landers wins the douchebag of the year award landers is revealed as the hourglass in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past jill twice in the same direction br br obviously the hourglass is foiled jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one
<START> ugh this movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess the story is halfway decent but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable we're actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the president's protectors then we're all in trouble roy scheider turns in a good performance as the president but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of patrick muldoon who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise or perhaps someone will see it and say hey if they can get a movie this bad made maybe i can too
<START> well what to say br br i think i shall start with a confession i have cried 4 times in my life once when my dad died twice due to a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this film this film deals with the real confronting issues of 6 school kids forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open for all the world to see i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this everything from incest to is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes br br it starts off with a suicide at 2 then without letting you know who it was that died the story begins to be told from the start of the day it follows the lives of 6 school kids up until 2 it interchangeably and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers lets you know everything about their lives their loves hates dreams desires secrets shame false confidence self loathing corruption and arrogance the overall outcome of which is a sort of whodunnit trying to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film without spoiling anything i must let you know do not feel cheated by the ending it contains a very important lesson br br and now a warning this film is definitely not for the faint hearted many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it disgusted by some of it's content or perhaps it's that it's sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality this is what high school is like for many people i'm sure most would agree
<START> spend your time any other way even housework is better than this movie the jokes aren't funny the fun rhymes that are dr seus aren't there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids 4 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net my wife left and did dishes so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isn't funny isn't cute the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label
<START> the long kiss goodnight has just about everything action fans want a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote lethal weapon samuel l jackson and great action set pieces by renny harlin br br seriously underrated one of the best action movies ever
<START> this is the latest ghibli movie and it is also a major departure from the studio's established style first of all this film was obviously aimed at young children much more so than any of their previous films it lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of and yet it is ever so entertaining even though there is nothing put in to attract adults i still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story the movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters the story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings intentions etc but that makes them all the more endearing special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely amazing despite being way different from previous ghibli soundtracks i find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie
<START> i'm slowly ploughing through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my favourite actors br br its a great action film although not as ott as the title might suggest it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable br br the biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would appear that rob the guy who did the to death' song which was popular in 'the matrix' has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his angels' album the tune in question is called 'im not driving anymore' and is also the opening tune for the tv series 'law and order' and the opening track on the reloaded' dvd menu teaser that really surprised me due to the sheer
<START> take someone you love or want to love and go see this film br br it touches you in all the right places br br all the other reviewers here have said it all br br perhaps the cynical will not be impressed br br they only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days br br this film is ga run to stay with you for life br br i am so gratified that the director is not usc trained br br this validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in film these days br br it is because of the usc mentality and inbreeding br br hooray for jeff hare and richard marcus cast and crew well done
<START> this is by far the worst movie ever made i have no doubt i have seen such crap as manos space mutiny and whatnot and i can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle to science crazed br br science crazed has no plot something about a guy making a woman pregnant via turkey and the child born hours later is fully grown and ready to kill of course being a newborn it takes him about an hour to kill people the director loops footage constantly and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death there is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie however the dialogue arrives about a minute after it is spoken br br sample scene the monster is walking down a hall we know this because there is about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet in between loops we are treated to two women working out repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes when the monster does show up no one moves and everyone looks like deer in headlights as the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them by the level of the acting you would guess that the people are already dead br br i know my description doesn't seem too bad but trust me i can not fully describe the pain that is science crazed br br stay away and boycott all video stores that carry it br br
<START> nevsky is one of the great epic war films sure others such as birth of a nation and napoleon had come before but this one is just as influential the acting is stock but anyone who knows the first thing about eisenstein would know that that was part of his theory of film this film unlike many of his silent works is about the heroic individual as much as it is about the group this reflects the stalinist philosophy that had risen to the fore by 1938 still his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something they perceive as evil nevsky is just one of many men he is prince because he is strongest but not because he is somehow different than the rest the film's romantic angles provide more of a personal story than eisenstein had previously allowed not all of the elements work and the film is probably a bit too long but it still resonates
<START> imaginary heroes the remarkable work of the then 24 year old dan harris is tag lined people are never who they seem to be perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing yet i rented this movie in spite of the tag line rather than because of it and i'm glad i did i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy i personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams particularly those which are lost in the case of one son loss requires deep examination of what he had and didn't have in his life yet the central tragedy of the movie while posing enticing questions in its own right acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief i believe the film inquires into an important question how do we cope with our dreams particularly where heroes become imaginary
<START> worthless movie a complete waste of time and nothing what i expected it to be the packaging makes it seem as if it is of the american pie genre it isn't rather it is a ridiculous stringing together of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise let's try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad snl skit into a full length feature presentation what is remarkable is that the director's based on their commentary on the dvd take themselves completely seriously i have been a huge fan of the movies that national lampoon lends its name to up to and including van wilder with this one i feel completely cheated in fact i feel duped i was expecting a van wilder like farce to relive my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage what lead to my ultimately unmet expectations well for starters the fact that the cast all appear naked with an enormous sausage covering what must be covered on the cover of the dvd add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a movie that it is not to make matters worse the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half naked drunk college students feebly trying a photo stunt but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie in fact i didn't even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until i was told so by the directors in the commentary don't get me wrong i love plot twists and being surprised by movies but i hate the fact that this movie tries to pawn itself off as something it is not ultimately it does itself a huge disservice artistically though most likely not financially because it sets its audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises br br in short do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case it is not your usual national lampoon movie the only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and tv shows that make their involvement here entertaining
<START> very simply they are all the syndicated episodes and not the original uncut unedited nbc episodes it is not the complete first season all eps are edited to conform to 21 00 for syndication meaning jokes are cut an extra commercial fade is included all of the harvey korman intros are not here very poorly done shame on a series i've been waiting for if you're a true die hard mama fan don't buy this and go to http com web main help customer service and send them comments on why we're unhappy on this butcher job to a classic sitcom
<START> the movie was fantastic if your a fan of videos jackass or his show viva la bam you cant help but like it i have a few friends who aren't fans that enjoyed it and others who thought it wasn't that great those who didn't like it were mostly female friends they really didn't appreciate some of the crude humor that personally i think made the movie so funny i'm pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in bams home town which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations the cast of is made up of all his friends and buddies and also includes some big name pro too the soundtrack is phenomenal with music by him in my opinion haggard has it all a great plot characters you'll never see anywhere else plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project
<START> even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time i saw this movie not for people who are easily upset by intense material the finest performances by alan rickman and stowe without a doubt this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for any reason whether they are or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame it still scares the hell out me today it's happening now br br apparently imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review imdb might want to get a grip some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions
