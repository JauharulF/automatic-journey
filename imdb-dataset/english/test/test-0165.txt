<START> for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings who love film have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you br br for those with a poor attention span high expectations and no brains well um you may get bored and find things dragging at times br br this is a charming modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles i chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through br br this film is a little gem
<START> i was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later point was a regular viewer i remember that i really enjoyed the show along with leave it to beaver my three sons ozzie and harriet dick van dyke reruns of i love lucy the real mccoys etc i am now enjoying the first season of donna reed on dvd and have watched the first two episodes donna stone is shown to be an intelligent well mannered problem solving serene stay at home mom similar to june cleaver and in contrast to lucy ricardo in episode 2 i especially like how ms reed becomes a surrogate dad trading in her dress for sweats and boxing gloves while teaching her son how to defend himself physically against a much larger bully while none of the mothers in the neighborhood i grew up in including my own exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by ms reed it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision making prevail at the end of the day in contrast to today's accepted standards of vulgarity selfishness and indifference among one's neighbors i cannot imagine jeff and mary stone being told by their parents that trespassing in their yards is okay leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable or telling their mother to shut up in a supermarket in front of everyone
<START> the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said let's make fun of the russians and at the same time show people how advanced we americans are the movie portrays the russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the americans it is true that american campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are however this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between east and west to me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the cold war
<START> out of the many films i've seen tommy boy is a rare film where i can watch it over and over and it's still funny david spade and the late chris farley do their best in this film and is a must see by anyone who's a fan of the spade farley duo
<START> i understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories but the way he tried to show time passing by the couple of who first appear jogging together than jogging with a sic than the man alone and to link the adventures of the characters the final scene with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying oh a boat were awful at the same time i liked the way he portrayed the middle high class even in an excessive way i think it is a lousy movie if you want to watch it do it as a film school student trying to see technical aspects and issues it will help a lot
<START> i rented this movie to get an easy entertained view of the history of texas i got a headache instead the depiction of history in this movie is so comical that even mad tv would not have done a better job
<START> this movie had terrible acting terrible plot and terrible choice of actors leslie nielsen come on the one part i considered slightly funny was the battling fbi cia agents but because the audience was mainly kids they didn't understand that theme
<START> as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles it is no surprise that shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles magical mystery tour the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie called head both movies are not so much a true story with a plot though mmt attempted to define a plot as they are a hodge podge of skits and snippets interspersed with music and songs and out takes br br head has no plot other than the pre fab four trying to break free of the box they are in i e the type casting of being monkees and the surrounding commercialism and yet always finding themselves back in the box most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other seemingly unrelated scenes filled with anti vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents the film bounces around haphazardly also to be blamed on the multiple directors br br the film like magical mystery tour is now excused by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements like mmt it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap br br like mmt head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through but it is not ironic at all that like everything else the monkees did this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first even when it comes to laying an egg
<START> masterpiece and a movie that captures the swedish soul it also served as a great inspiration for bergman the between and with in the leading role as borg from 1957 is not a coincidence don't miss it for the world
<START> i will confess that once i started watching this movie it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim or maybe fascination that they got funding to make distribute and show this film that kept me searching it for merit or possibly some bizarre wish fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain but no such luck br br so you are warned to not start watching it in the first place lest the same thing happen to you there's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on br br the first person mockumentary and the schtick about fabian's quest to impregnate women of the falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric maybe freshman high school freshman that is film student project than you might imagine the effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants who other than the two professional leads are in fact real people as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically it's pointless and sexist br br the reason i ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a there's an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until it's completely off even when you know it's bad for you you just want to see what happens br br in the end this is rather dishonest filmmaking because it seems ultimately to have no moral center no elucidation of the local political situation nor any place in the type of political sexual personal film universe a la goddard in short it's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does smug would be the one word tagline br br i'd suggest the filmmakers rent for a few times or hell even 'blair witch project' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion or at least entertainment value
<START> this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film br br the story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the gray characters turn good and the bad guys get their just desserts and boom it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up br br which wouldn't have been so bad if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place but such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess br br my advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes and then shut it off at this point imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far br br believe me the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends trust me on this
<START> lazy movie made by a lazy director the characters are grotesque despite the tragic of this war there is no emotion at all in the movie symbolism is artificial and inefficient and old bosnian woman giving a photo of her son to will her willingness will awake the super mother sleeping inside her a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide too much is sometimes worst than not enough br br this movie is only an advertisement an empty to a woman who is not a hero she worked for united nations remember un failed to protect civilians at srebrenica who are the true heroes of this war a canadian judge leading post mortem trial for atrocities that happened mostly because her organization failed to prevent them where is the criticism in this movie
<START> while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics both are way above average roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering he played a version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and gutsy approach if a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn't gutsy then tell me what is br br tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city gritty unglamorous often dangerous but filled with energy the story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without extraneous elements it may not be one of the all time greats but it is an exceptionally good movie br br everyone has an opinion about car chases mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt the pontiac ventura chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6 the ventura got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension mods they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track the bawling of those gm as they wind up is music to the ear i've heard this chase criticized for imitating the bullitt chase the truth is that they are two works by the same master bill hickman who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers br br yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm that's beside the point let's face it movie car chases are unreal by nature in bullitt the french connection and the seven ups however bill hickman and phillip crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films
<START> basically this is a very good film it is very different from seagal's other films though which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans unlike some of the other films this does not feel like a you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before the concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change although there are some unrealistic parts to the film some more obvious than others in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch br br it boils down to this if you are looking for a classic seagal action film sorry but you're going to be disappointed watch it anyway for the fun of it if you're open to seeing seagal without the action it's well worth a look i personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while br br
