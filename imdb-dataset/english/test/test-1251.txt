<START> this is definitely a touching movie and a great expression of charles personal struggle the movie is not only about his struggle to get his book the origin of species published but also his relationship with his oldest daughter his daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views something that she as well had to pay for een more than him at times br br now this is not an evolutionary propaganda film as a matter of fact i think it managed to stay very neutral a hard thing to do in my opinion of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church quite the opposite actually if you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film it will be liked by and atheists alike but goes away from the movie talks about evolution and that's it br br paul bettany as charles darwin was incredible of course we all may think of darwin as that old man with the funny beard but this movie centers around the man in his late 20's early 30's jennifer connelly emma darwin is great as always but the actor who impressed me was martha west as annie darwin daughter definitely on of the best child actors of the decade the story is about darwin and his daughter and it is beautifully acted br br except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing the production of this film is pretty flawless some scenes were darwin observes nature is just marvelous and is almost like taken out of a high production national geographic documentary br br i must admit though i'm not quite sure of why they chose creation as the title i doubt it is an irony the movie is too respectful for that well i'm sure there's a meaning too it just don't let it scare you away br br i give this movie a 9 10 this is truly a great tribute to charles darwin and please give it a chance
<START> i've watched a lot of tv through the years so much that when i start seeing new shows that basically seem like reruns of old shows i get insulted luckily i am not too sensitive because all hot properties does is updates the cast meaning make them sexier of designing women and drops them in new york city instead of georgia br br the jokes are more tv 14 ish but it does not make the show any better the only thing that this show has proved is that nicole sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like my mother the car a classic her comic talents remind one of a modern day lucille ball only funnier unfortunately the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy which might be good for some brainless soap but they just aren't funny br br fred
<START> i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie the acting is astonishing the movie itself is powerful and clear and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth br br this is an important movie it could be profoundly transformative br br i would pay good money never ever to see it again because it is so good and so complex it is extremely difficult to watch i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle br br but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once preferably with others so you can talk to each other and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie
<START> i thought this was a beautiful film it is not my favourite of his films chungking express holds that spot this one is quite different from anything else i have seen of his it is slow but not annoyingly so it takes its time and ponders the characters there is minimal movement in the frame the camerawork is wonderful the acting is great the film feels like a long warm comforting drink
<START> thomas hardy is one of my favorite authors some truly wonderful movies have been made from his novels far from the madding crowd tess of the the mayor of and i had high hopes for this one the hallmark hall of fame of return of the native totally wrecked it the cast was terrific the photography excellent but the script was dismal and the direction positively ruinous people walked up to people said lines walked away a meager excitement developed when clive owen and catherine zeta jones very young very beautiful exchanged a bit of flesh pressing but even clive who is a superb actor couldn't save it it was awash with the usual hallmark romantic strings background music and pretend bumpkins offering plot exposition and what could have been dynamite turned out to be awful the richness of the above three movies was absent
<START> while i agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix bronson paul once again takes to the streets given a license to kill by the chief police no less and moves into his friends apartment who you guessed it was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood which looks like it's funny that people who associate with bronson have a habit of getting killed bronson systematically kills them off one by one as the people in the neighborhood are used against him there are some dynamics between bronson and who leads the street gang you can tell they both enjoy their work at one point in the movie after they scuffle in the city jail say's i'm going to kill a little old lady just for you catch it on the 6 00 news the a purse thief who laughs as he's committing his crimes is also enjoyable to watch the movie was made in 1985 and most people probably could identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are cast in the movie it's enjoyable watching bronson paul rid the streets of these thugs watch for the appearance of the magnum a serious piece of hardware that bronson wields i also really liked the soundtrack to this movie
<START> i have great memories of this movie br br i was only 12 when it was released and it scared the bejesus out of me i really miss my bejesus br br zombies graveyards how can you go wrong it's like retarded cousin br br this movie was released 1 year before the pg 13 rating was instituted br br i submit that one dark night is the goriest pg movie not scariest mind you that has ever been released br br can anyone come up with a gorier pick br br fyi i don't consider poltergeist to be gorier scarier yes but not gorier
<START> gen y cops since i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didn't return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way br br stephen fung returns as the ladies man match who has a steady girl in note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as edison i also enjoyed paul rudd's performance of agent curtis he seems to be the tough as nails fbi agent you'd love to hate but soon you'd like his character br br the fight scenes are a lot better in this one even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li br br look for a cameo from ron as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match also is the stunt double for rudd br br if you liked gen x cops you'll love gen y cops
<START> this is the greatest show ever made next to south park i love this show it is so funny and peter's laugh is hilarious you need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before one of my favorite shows of all time br br if you can try to see some of the later episodes such as i dream of jesus or tales of a third grade nothing but there's never been an episode i didn't like all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious it's got a great satire to it as well you can find a lot of clips on you tube if you're somewhere near a computer or a tv see it right away however you can
<START> midnight madness is a movie that is unfortunately highly underrated and unappreciated with a flood of classic edgy teen college movies this one was forgotten as a child i would watch this movie over and over again luckily i had it on video this movie shows a more tame but most exciting side of the eighties in the cynical society we live in this day and age with drug abuse being the coolest thing it's good to see once in awhile a fun innocent movie that is midnight madness that is if you can find it
<START> as a former highland rugby hr player i feel like i can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward i think that i am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories oh and this is gonna be a long post i can tell already br br first off the people who said that the movie doesn't show real rugby have a valid point the movie is full of bad tackles people in the wrong places and much much more if you want to know what a real rugby game feels like you won't get the best idea from this movie but the thing is anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself is not going to be satisfactory it's hollywood not espn really how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game not many that i have seen i think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players much more than it is about rugby br br next the is very much a part of highland rugby it is not something that they just threw into the movie to be honest i don't know how the tradition got started but highland emulates the all blacks in many ways the uniform is based off of the all blacks as well the movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the and to be honest i don't think that that is right but i can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means as for the person from china who said that only a can perform a i would suggest that they take a look at the all blacks and tell me if they think that they are all believe it or not utah has a very large polynesian community and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams i myself am part hawaiian whenever possible the is led by a the team does not do it because they think that they are they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie the concept of unity and those who have gone before is a huge part of the hr culture and the message behind the for any of those that are familiar with it support those values it's a chant by a chief who thought he would die ka mate and those around him supporting him telling him he will live ka ora and boosting him up how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done kia is also a well used team motto even if the actors had a hard time saying it br br also for the people who questioned rugby playing ability i would just remind you that you were not really watching highland play in this movie many of the extras were former players from highland and other teams but the main characters were all actors believe it or not highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community granted some years produce better teams than others it's what you would expect with any sports team but you don't accumulate win record by just being okay the year after i graduated 1998 highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the world schools rugby championship in zimbabwe the teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at the time highland obviously didn't win first place new zealand did that but they did manage to take third place in the tournament beating the national champions in their last match and while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about highland also has a tradition of touring new zealand every few years and usually comes back with more wins than losses br br the majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories i watched this movie with my brothers who also played for highland and between the four of us we were fairly certain that we were able to identify almost every main character nobody knew a white rasta of course as this wasn't a documentary hollywood did take some liberties but to tell you the truth not as many as you might think the film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training sometimes it really was running until you threw up it also showed the service and other team activities like the chuck a rama buffet that were very much a part of team bonding br br and finally the movie in my obviously very biased opinion it was a pretty good movie and i think that the reason for it is that i watched it as an inspirational sports movie i didn't think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama it was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team complete with morals encouragement and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment i hope that i addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was br br kia
<START> i caught this at the chicago and have to say you are alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think not ha ha wedding crashers' funny but sick twisted i can't believe she just said that but it's so damn true funny br br jessica who deservedly won best actress is amazing to watch there's never a moment when you think oh i'm watching a movie and she's an actress she's too damn real for words br br in fact there's 2 scenes that i'm still giggling over and i won't give them away but in one she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is i almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing br br in another she talks about a teenagers definition of sex versus an adults and if it isn't the truest dialog i've heard in a movie in a long time i don't know what is
<START> i have never watched a movie that frustrated me more than lord of the dance frustrated because it could have been fantastic frustrated because the dancing might have been astounding frustrated because the women could have been gorgeous how would i know though by the time your eyes have moved to the area of interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired the insane editor has moved the shot i completely agree with the other comments here about the crappy lighting and terrible camera editor work it makes me nauseous just watching ten minutes of this would be spectacular movie br br give me an opportunity to get a front seat to the live concert and i would be there in a shot br br nicholas t
<START> making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn't do anything for the audience the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor br br what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed br br i don't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show br br the deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written what i would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them the film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social political commentary br br my overall impression was that the film was rushed thematically under developed and visually not up to standard on a positive note the performances and music were very good
<START> this movie was so dumb and slow was it ever slow the only good part of the film was the girl in the tight gold pants there was no gore and what is a 80's horror movie without a little gore plus the killer wasn't at all scary nor were the murders but if you like to watch the world's worst horror movie then this is for you don't waste your time like i did watching this
