<START> itÂ´s long time that i and my wife didnÂ´t see such a boring thriller itÂ´s definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really donÂ´t miss anything we gave 4 10
<START> this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough the acting and plot aren't that impressive but the lines just keep on coming this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going i was especially fond of sharon the canuck on eh however the one that really stole the show was richard's little brother andrew ira heiden his high pitched whining was somehow endearing the whole movie rocked
<START> the thing with ali g is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character br br the humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect irreverent and self effacing type br br personally i totally love this film and so has everyone i have met who has seen it you can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time the humour is both aural and visual and the timing is impeccable the humour is probably very english and specifically london so its possible that non english viewers may not get some of the humour think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it especially if the likes of kevin perry go large tickled you
<START> this is what disney channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts it suits them well it's not funny the acting is the worst i've seen in many years there are more stereotypes than there are actors and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes wanna know why not only is this show a waste of airtime the lead actress selena gomez looks like a pig jake t austin's character needs some ritalin david character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted also the writer of the show is inconsistent in one episode the security guard is called sir by one character and referred to as a woman by all else br br hello it's called and editing do it sometime disney br br has anyone seen the promo for the new four part bloodsucking saga disney wanted their own version of the twilight vs harry potter thing except a million times lamer the wizards of waverly place movie think about it for a minute family goes away on vacation and 16 year old daughter wants independence from parents same plot from the proud family movie etc br br what's worse is all the emmies and it got and most of the audience are some what 4 13 and no life teenagers how many more years before selena gomez is showing her tits br br and disney shows are all crap hack writers hack shows destroying the minds and wallets of today's youth
<START> being american i have not been exposed to this character before which is good because some of you have been disappointed i have nothing to compare it to i have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the american teen movies and although this is a slightly similar type of humor i couldn't stop laughing i hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie and usually a movie has a few funny parts for me but this movie was funny from start to finish my only disappointment was when it was over i'm actually going to buy this on dvd when i find it
<START> good footage of world war i era ships and planes supplement this excellent war drama set in the adriatic walter huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings the safety of the ship and the mission must always come first robert montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat he makes bad decisions endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a real man after he is court martialed and dismissed from the navy robert young plays a lieutenant junior grade and jimmy durante as a cook paralleling the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between montgomery and madge evans who plays huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator recommended
<START> i provided location services on the this film every sunday we would shoot in london's berkeley square david niven ever the gentleman thoroughly enjoyed the role sadly to be his last we had a moment of panic when a trunk load of fake cast for the film tipped down a storm drain br br imagine frantic crew opening all the drains to recover every last one if you know and love london you'll love this comedy romp also starts richard jordan who sadly died from a brain tumour a good film great crew superb cast look for the current stars of coronation street then playing crowd scenes or extras the car lot and retail enterprises were all shot in west london the entire shopping parade and the american used car lot were dressed overnight the car lot is still there as are the shops a restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral parlour if you see the film on the listings make an effort to see it by the way sally harrison the bank receptionist was married to the production designer tony curtis br br april 2007 just thought i would add a few extra comments on locations br br pub just off berkeley square elke sommers cottage in back road film studios ivans used car lot along high street and all shop locations near roundabout workshops converting armoured vans factory on roundabout opposite brewery jail see workshops above telephone box see elke sommers cottage it was the wooden studio prop box used in many films look for the lighting cable at level and the wood hinges on the door computer room near olympia graveyard grave just outside the boundary on common land bank interiors ceiling void and studios br br and just to add david niven ever the gentleman joked and mixed with the crew extras and so on niven would dine in the connaught hotel bu join the crew for coffee
<START> i mean come on this movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2 3rds of the way through characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises they also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie it's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more br br i was really hoping this would be a good movie there was some good acting mark hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart so does sally struthers it was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable i felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers brad hunt does an excellent job he really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies i recently saw lucky 13 which was a piece of crap this guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director br br almost forgot the music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored i call this kind of music teller music because you can just tell what's coming next based on the music less is more sometimes br br cut half of the music from this movie get a good film editor a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie
<START> i was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time they disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to africa and they even act like stepin fetchit and all the others rolled into one there are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman i have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try merrie melodies coal black and de dwarfs or angel puss you won't find them on dvd because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as youtube i don't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early america was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but i have seen better for its time br br plane unnecessary 1 out of 10
<START> im a big horror fan and i quite enjoyed this remake with all these horror remakes floating about i think this is one of the better attempts br br i watched it with my two little sisters and i think it made it even better as they were quite scared also with the shouting at the screen dont do that not that way etc i thought there were some good little jumpy moments and it built the tension well br br camilla belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress so she holds your attention well br br overall a decent film
<START> just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the michigan bar exam i wanted something that was mindless and that i could just sit back and say what the hell were they thinking i was not disappointed in this undertaking but had i been watching this one in a serious mood i would have been irate the company that made this thing just spliced cgi footage from the first octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in bride of the monster look like a masterpiece of special effect footage since when does an octopus have fangs the plot is that an nypd diver is investigating some murders disappearances on the hudson river shortly before the fourth of july he and his partner who is soon to be transferred or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus investigate in a rather inept manner all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the mayor's office of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office surprisingly all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed br br really lame don't bother with it
<START> ok i wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews but this movie was awful just plain awful the characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them the story was abysmal the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through it just completely becomes forgotten the visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup i don't know what this guy is trying to pull off it's like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog this movie makes me think that there is no way american cinema can ever do this i want to give up watching movies altogether bad bad movie
<START> this movie was a heart felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that shaped who tom hank's was using a very cryptic story they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom hank's character as a child and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth in all good conscience i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10 great performances from all the actors and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father and tom hanks covers it up using a far fetched story about a flying machine pay close attention to the little details such as the turtle that he still has even though his brother flew off with it truly a beautiful piece of cinema and every actor deserves recognition for it
<START> i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered i remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007 and thought it would be short lived and not very well written because it was on abc family br br never doubt an abc family show this show surprised me in the best way possible not only is the show well written story lines are realistic funny and enjoyable i was expecting a lot of talk about relationships something like this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid etc but this show is anything but the characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all there is a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening right before your eyes br br don't doubt this show it is truly enjoyable to watch and get hooked on
<START> as a physicist talk about and gets my heart racing however i found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested layman who is most likely to see it if you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff go to the library and check out some books you will find they explain current scientific with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does also to set the record straight hawking is not considered the greatest mind or the world's smartest person as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the imdb hawking himself has commented that it is rubbish it is just media hype they needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius at least i'm disabled to be fair he is probably a genius but among history's greatest scientists people like einstein newton and many others easily are even more highly regarded this is not to disrespect hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has anyhow see the movie if you are truly into science but if not i think it would be boring for you
