<START> excellent exercise on multiple plans br br showing the not yet ended colonialism spirit in france br br more generally the boring mindset of superiority from all western people br br a renewal of the spy and thriller movies oss 117 is uncultured and stupid br br the good idea is that in spite of all these messages it is a funny film plenty of jokes and gags very light and sparkling br br special mention to jean and br br definitely worth seeing wonder how it will be appreciated in us br br seems to be a success in france so probably a next version will come
<START> i saw this movie at the locarno film festival in italian speaking part of switzerland br br aishwarya rai is good looking br br i rate this movie 7 10 because of its nice moments br br spoilers ahead br br it has some really nice cinematic moments in it specially at the end br br though my general feeling is this is too long over 2 hours and 40 minutes and containing too much dialogs and nearly no dancing at all br br clearly a bollywood movie like lagaan or devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared with bali
<START> farley and spade's best work ever it's one of the all around funniest movies i've ever seen watch it once and you'll be hooked and soon have all the lines memorized no sleepy for tommy boy
<START> i turned this off about 50 minutes into it whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of book battle royal make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario deserves to be shot br br it has done the film industry a good turn though now directors like william malone fear dot com can say well at least it's better than series 7 this piece of crap dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made br br be warned this is not a 'so bad it's br br this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere br br never see this movie
<START> i seriously enjoy dr who br br seriously don't just dismiss me as a sci fi person because i'm not normally i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it it is actually really funny and more often than not it's fast paced all of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle br br christopher is pretty good but david tennant is brilliant i think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character again br br i don't know what it is about it but everything manages to work like clockwork br br all i'm going to say is just try it one episode probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two parter though
<START> first off i am a huge fan of robert blake always have been br br this movie came on last night 10 13 and the title interested me of course the star but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started there are some good scenes and i thought they would lead somewhere but they didn't it turned out to be an anti cop anti buddy anti hippie pretty much anti everything movie with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere br br robert blake is great as the lead well as great as someone could be with this bad movie i am still a huge fan of mr blake and love his acting even in crap like this but this drug induced 70's tripe well better stay away from this one and that ending what a
<START> a friend of mine asked doesn't one have to be pro euthanasia in order to like this movie is it a mistake of the movie to infer most want to end their lives interesting questions br br as far as i can see correct me if i'm wrong there is only one who wanted to end his life in the sea inside think ramÃ³n addressed this in the movie as well it is he who wants to die it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death he is speaking for himself and not other though his pioneering work depending on one's perspective may prove beneficial or damaging to down the road his primary objective is a personal one but one thing this movie does my opinion anyway is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the questions my friend so succinctly put forth br br after my first viewing of the sea inside i walked home in a conflicted blur i struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion why would ramÃ³n want to die given the love care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on ramÃ³n by the people surrounding him why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision then on my second viewing a shared thought between ramÃ³n and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness it threw up a telling observation total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy most human beings crave for such an intimacy of course how much we value such needs depends largely on the individual br br as a person with a familial biased sensibility i empathised strongly with the in this movie why can't javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends is he blind to it all i would think not the miracle of the sea inside therefore is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war when we are faced with the of a sane but incapacitated loved one whom has expressed a calm conscious and rational intent to die what then is the right thing to do is caring for and keeping this loved one alive against his or her will a pious gesture does it show up the worth of our love or does it merely soothe our selfish fears of irreplaceable loss with so much understanding accorded to wouldn't their invalid charges by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival also be an overlooked act of sacrifice rhetorical or not how much is dignity worth to an individual is living or dying with dignity a privilege or a right if we really care and love a person should we also respect their eventual decisions in life as in death a torrent of questions the movie might have asked answers to which i'm in no position to provide br br in our eagerness to intellectually the merits of pro life or pro choice we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's the people most intimately affected the and the ones they care for the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them intuitively this film understands one thing that the nature of sacrifice is never one sided in this tug of war we should endeavour not to win arguments but to intently observe and hopefully determine who is the stronger party to make that sacrifice br br the sea inside is a sobering film it opened my eyes to things i don't wanna see and for that i am grateful
<START> one of my favorite lines in shakespeare br br i e we're not finished with you by a long shot so not only does shylock not get his pound of flesh or the 3 000 or the 6 000 or the 36 000 each of the 6 parts were a in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to forfeit all his possessions and his daughter has long abandoned him already br br vengeance is a dish best served cold but attempt at revenge totally backfires br br i suspect this play was and is popular because it caters to the wish we have for justice but the hard reality is the world is engulfed in injustice and most of it stands a few big names get tossed in jail gang punks lose their turf to the 'good guys' but in reality most of the time it's the other way around br br but not in this play the long howls of racism and forgets that it could well have been any other social outcast group that gets the comeuppance it's just that the money lenders of the time were jews and therefore the needs of the story line puts shylock the jew into the role of villain br br merchant of venice is my 3rd favorite work by shakespeare 1 and 2 being hamlet and macbeth this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story the scenes with the suitors alone is worth watching also the awkwardness of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact they let the rings so easily slip away that they had sworn to keep forever in real life this trick is the thing that spouses coyly use to remind their better half that promises must mean something and not be made there is far deeper significance to this play than just the comedy dramatic aspect it is about loyalty commitment and love br br well worth watching over and over
<START> i've sat through several pauly shore movies but this is the only one that i've liked of course it helps that he is far less irritating than usual perhaps even a little likeable the rest of the cast does a fine job especially underrated carla the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy and although few of the jokes are especially funny the film is quite entertaining overall
<START> the emperor's new groove cast returns for disney pictures follow up but this time the spotlight is on voiced by patrick warburton who is no longer eartha kitt henchman has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant things go merrily along until gets word that his john mahoney is coming for a visit is worried because he knows that his life won't impress his one thing that he has always wanted and never received is a thumbs up from his dad a flurry of blunders and a gigantic cheese explosion in the restaurant leaves our likable hero very deep in trouble and anxiety to save the day a little help from his friends br br other voices tracey ullman david spade john goodman malick april and green
<START> throughout this movie i kept thinking why on earth did they make this as a documentary yet not include real footage of the people who were interviewed sure it would have been just like any other documentary but then it would have been up to the film makers to find the meaning for the movie to deliver br br using a host of well known movie stars many of whom apparently asked to be in it to portray real people gave me the feeling that there was a pre determined message to be delivered and the director was so intent on it that real people couldn't be trusted so actors and rehearsed scenes were used yes i know this was also a play but a documentary should be a documentary i really found myself getting put off by the various stars and kept expecting one of them to drop character for a moment and say i'm a good person because i'm in this br br this movie could have had a much more powerful social commentary had it been more objective or let us see matthew shepard and his murderers as people rather than symbols the much superior boys don't cry had an unflinching view of those involved good and bad instead the laramie project gives an almost relentless lecture that someone's sexuality should be accepted regardless and little else
<START> if you like madonna or not this movie is hilarious i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release however over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun sure there are some bad lines cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast she is cute funny and is the only comedic role of her movie career madonna usually just plays in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film she really seems like somebody else for once of course the film is directed by james foley who filmed the dramatic and haunting 'at close with sean penn christopher walken and co stars griffin dunn 'after who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material the story is nothing genius and don't expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun clean 80's romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs the 1 hit who's that girl the 2 hit causing a commotion and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads the look of top 10 hit in the uk and can't stop a left over pop ditty from the 'true sessions the year before it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd
<START> my mother told me not to go to see but who ever listens to one's mother br br i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater so i checked with card carrying feminists the next day no they also thought it was much more an anti orthodox screed than a pro feminist statement painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban br br while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra orthodox it is so nasty as to be unbelievable plus that the non fanatic orthodox rock 'n' roller one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy even in israel that must be fantasy br br the theater was quite crowded so there's a pent up curiosity to see israeli movies too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies br br originally written 4 29 2000
<START> sappy br br i liked how they went to the to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there br br probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job br br just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it do you like apples br br the guy nods or something br br well how'd ya like dem apples wow that is genius br br duh minnie driver would give her number to anybody robin williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf and there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason
<START> this was obviously a low budget film it shows in every scene what is nice to see is where it was made a lot of the film was shot in columbia ca in the sierra nevada mountains near ca some of the film was also shot in jamestown ca very near columbia there is a railroad museum in jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture high noon was also shot in jamestown as was back to the future iii
