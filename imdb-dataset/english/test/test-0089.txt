<START> though it pains me to some degree that i'm bothering to christen the comments board for this new series mainly because i'd hate to give the false impression that there's actually any semblance of public interest in it i feel compelled to throw in my chips on this one br br to put it simply never before have i felt so persuaded to root for a tv show's swift and merciless cancellation based solely on the merit of its promo ads and in case you're wondering i'm a dude br br listen comedy network though your existing original programming is already shall we politely say of a quality i'm looking at you girls will be girls you have truly outdone yourselves on this one whoever green lit this thing could not be further out of touch with what's cool right now br br best of luck
<START> captain mandolin is one of nicolas cage's better films he turns a fine performance as the title character this is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island john hurt's character gives his daughter played beautifully by penelope cruz some honest advice about love this movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable this movie also allows cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it again nicolas cage did not disappoint
<START> i had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm technicolor stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered also closer to the original material basically all screenwriter n richard nash did was trim change much to spoken dialog and insert a transitional scene or two including a very amusing one for pearl bailey oliver smith's production design is stagy in the li'l abner guys and dolls '50s adaptation mode but it works well for this work's folkloric unrealistic quality stereotyping and racism are present but not to a wince inducing degree further for a movie of its time it's pretty frank the adultery violent behavior drug use and self destructive habits of the denizens of catfish row are not at all in the telling but there are beginning with all that variation from the stage text the loss of so much compromises gershwin's brilliance no wonder the family doesn't like it the especially of sammy davis jr 's material is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar george knew what he was doing folks you didn't have to mess with it so much and while poitier and dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well there's a huge chasm between the characters' singing and speaking voices you're constantly aware of the artifice what really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere despite all the tinkering it survives and you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it if the treatment isn't entirely to the estate's liking and it shouldn't be there's still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of gershwin's masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius
<START> until i did a web search on what alice found i didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of lewis carroll's books the book's complete title is through the looking glass and what alice found there br br the alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of lewis carroll's alice her fresh and assertive character however is similar the movie alice begins as a young woman in new hampshire who steals money from her ass patting boss and takes off for miami vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins she encounters a middle aged couple in a motor home the husband's retired from the military who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car's breakdown perhaps caused by their br br as it turns out the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet young alice as a promising recruit the wife played by judith in a performance worthy of some big award buys alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup initially alice passively accepts her ministrations and with the couple's instructions does several tricks the encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life the man is shy and deferential and apologizes for finishing too fast br br what's wonderful about alice and different from her prototypes from clarissa to sister carrie is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself this is how things really are prostitution is everywhere people are neither all good or all bad alice leaves the motor home with her well earned money and a feeling of mutual respect
<START> mmmm a previous summary says if you like aliens and predator you will enjoy this film i could not disagree more this film pays no respect to its weighty lineage and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi strands to little more than a teen horror slasher movie it has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous alien or predator movies and there is no discernible lead character i really did not care about any of the characters and i positively yearned to see the stereotypical cast die as soon as possible in the vain hope something better would replace them it really takes super human incompetence to have two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented positively fail to make a gripping thrilling movie only watch this if you want to see how not to do it
<START> the intertwined points of view can come up as a good idea in some movies here it is a total mess br br but the total mess begin with the story a video clip wants to shoot a light comedy with a pernicious noir like female character she is gorgeous and no men could resist to dive and crawl and suck her toes she is all the more looking as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth br br the movie does melt away in its own pretentiousness being smart funny good looking at his best white trash only please
<START> i found this early talkie difficult to watch and i'm a norma shearer fan it's not her fault but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored 90 of the movie is filmed with medium shots and it's very similar to watching a dull play
<START> i found this film to be extremely homophobic the main character doesn't know he's gay until he realizes that he likes barbra streisand and has a limp wrist i was so offended that after the screening at the toronto film festival i went up and spoke to the screen writer to complain about this film this is the sort of film that needs to work to have banned
<START> i just wanted to say that i love so i automatically loved this movie everything else about it was so so billy crystal is a good actor even if he is annoying but the thing that made this movie was at least for a basketball fan seeing act
<START> when i first saw the movie i thought it was sweet a family movie for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days though clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation there's a lot going on classic elements of farce good character acting and malick's story line is just hysterical labelling it a feel good movie belies the wit and fun it's smarter than it seems just like it's a wonderful life is
<START> someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between presenting multiple twists and screwing the audience over they even use hypnosis as a tool to cover up the plot holes whenever they can't find their way into or out of a scene they just say she is to her past now or she's snapping out of it now and they think that explains everything this movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a full blown fiasco 1 2
<START> this was the very first kung fu movie that i have ever seen the dubbing is not the greatest but alot better than some that i had seen the plot is much better than some that are made today it is gory at times but that is what gives it that special push academy award material is it not but if you like to watch fights and a decent story this is for you
<START> this film is pretty good it actually is like a good wine it gets better the more you watch it the pace is pretty slow for such a high octane topic but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal there is a cool blue tint that rides the whole film there is also one great performance in gabriel performance of the character midget he is terrific why doesn't this guy work more if the film got better support he probably would have
<START> i've tried to watch this film 3 or 4 times but i just can't get past the fact that everything about it is just awful i'm sure it was a courageous move by somebody to cast jack palance as the protagonist but there is not one single fiber of my being that believes that he could act at all much less act against type br br yes i understand that clifford odets was a brilliant author but it's not evident here this odd and forced mish mash of 50's hipster dialog seems to any genuine meaning which explains why none of the actors even the good ones steiger ida lupino shelly winters everett sloane seems to know how to deliver their lines it's as though they don't understand the meaning of what they are saying and in the meantime wendell corey and palance stage a terrific contest to see who can be more stone faced br br the direction is amateurish and completely overwrought the physical interaction between the characters is as stilted as the dialog br br and can we discuss that hideous set it's so busy ugly and contrived that it adds to the robotic disconnected quality of the characters the dialog and the portrayals br br this film seems to suck the energy right out of me it looks like everybody took an overdose of valium each morning when they arrived on the set it takes a pretty lousy movie to make rod steiger and shelly winters look bad but this one succeeds br br i can see that it might have been effective as a play on or off broadway where intellectuals and beats could have congratulated themselves for appreciating the power of the plot and the artsy flourishes of the pseudo hip dialog
<START> when i decided to try watching a movie about zombies i wasn't expecting a whole lot that's exactly what i got and then even less aside from a shortage of special effects squibs and a severe lack of any acting talent the chilling also sports the absolute worst script i've ever seen made into a movie i had to stop the tape numerous times during the first 45 minutes in order to repair the damage done to my intellect for witnessing such atrocious dialogue as there is found here br br furthermore the collection of characters is so formulaic and one dimensional it's ridiculous the corrupt doctor his assistant played by linda blair we know she's his assistant because he repeatedly refers to her by that title the recently widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with blair's character his criminal son the blair character's alcoholic abusive unemployed boyfriend whom we are introduced to in the most contrived use of a flashback and of course the rough tough bearded security guard who becomes the hero br br apparently the preserving fluid which some lab uses on its bodies is highly naturally resulting in disaster when all of the lab's containers end up outdoors in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm on halloween night no less as for the zombies themselves if you enjoy watching people in green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil suits then the chilling is the movie for you the zombie action is very weak at its best the zombies' primary killing method seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death the businessman and the security guard do most of the zombie fighting including a highly suspenseful scene of re freezing the undead with liquid let me tell you the steel mill scene in t2 has got nothing on the chilling in portraying an enemy getting frozen in his tracks like that br br how linda blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery true her career didn't exactly skyrocket during the 80s sadly but this movie is an embarrassment for her the script doesn't even have the decency to put her to any good use the most that her character is given to do is shriek out things like here they come do something hurry the only thing i can figure is that poor linda was compensated for her work on this film in rations of food the hero is played by grizzly adams himself dan haggerty in this picture he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog and he does his best to outperform them both br br the only frightening part of the chilling is the introduction which brings up the factual elements of and suggests that the film you are about to see could happen in your own community as i was counting the number of times a few of the names are repeated in the closing credits i was floored to suddenly see get credited fortunately it was only for the movie's sound production 1 10
