<START> this is an interesting movie i think it's very humorous although the humor is very black fulci is good and funny acting himself it's a really funny and truly crazy self portrait of an artist i make horror films if i would make love films no one would buy tickets and it's really sexy movie also almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girls women maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies art in the first place it's a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind there is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because it's lucio fulci as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting anyway it's one of the three best and most complete fulci films i've seen the others are house by the cemetery zombi haven't seen the beyond actually the script is to my opinion quite ingenious you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder fashionable words the character has a compulsive need to confess crimes or bad thoughts especially crimes he hasn't even done and he questions himself all the time what if i have done it what if i want to do it have i done it do i want to do it he overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts i'm sure fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in his house by the cemetery movie for example there is a character named this is maybe the most concentrated and personal movie fulci did i also like the simplicity of the photography pictures in this film only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism especially towards women i don't quite understand why is it entertainment is it art is it horror anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre for the others it may be too much
<START> my brain was screaming why do you keep watching turn it off and go to bed but couch won out and i watched until the predictable ending i guess when it's bruce campbell i need to give it a chance br br i find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie ted and bruce got their start on just such a movie but they didn't seem to learn from sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie br br it's sad too because bruce has always been a favorite after the 70's and 80's i just can't believe movies this bad are still being made bruce i'm really disappointed

<START> a few years ago i saw this remake of the sixties classic with the mini coopers for the first time and i remember liking it a lot now about two years later it was shown on television and i just wanted to know whether i would still like it as much as when i saw it in the cinema well the answer is yes br br the movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in venice italy the plan is flawless and the execution perfect they escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives but there is one problem they didn't take into account someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot but wants to keep it all for himself even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew but all but one survive and they are out for revenge one year later in los angeles this time the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor br br the story on itself is of course not very original since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that this is a typical heist action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind the action is very nice the landscapes and venice are real eye candy the story is ok and the special effects are stunning even the acting is very good something which you'll not often see in an action movie i must admit that i really liked what i saw and i give this movie a well deserved 7 5 10
<START> other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time if not for jason lee's unjustifiable success in film this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead br br the concept is terrible moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past is it funny periodically but not consistently is it stupid each and every single episode br br i've seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this blunder has survived longer than i ever could have imagined the dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes every episode for someone with an iq over 100 is an absolute struggle and the icing on the cake jason lee's annoying voice narrating each episode if it weren't for the state's southern culture and rednecks of the south this show wouldn't have an audience br br if you're a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet overflowing with bad taste bad dialog and dimwit characters failing at life well then you're probably an actor on this show
<START> the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all sunn produced these documentary films in the 1970s and just into the '80s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on br br sadly historic jesus is really little more than a third rate dramatization of the life of christ unlike more superior in search of noah's ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen time br br for fans of these quasi documentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesn't offer much
<START> what a joy to watch this family grow up and see the same children acting in this series eight years later anna lexi randall is a beautiful young lady working for a physician in town she is in love with his son justin who went away in the army and was injured in war and the newest daughter of jacob and sarah cassie is an outspoken cutie so transparently honest she often is embarrassing br br on a cold winter day a stranger shows up at the farm he is slow to reveal his identity when they find out he is jacobs father john thought long ago dead hard questions about the past are difficult to get answered br br glenn close is magnificent as a loving mother who wants only the best for all her family and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them sarah talking to jacob said it's all so fragile this life anything can happen in the blink of an eye i could have died in that blizzard think of justin and john probably more ill than we know time moves on the moment passes then it's too late it's a shame don't you think br br life lessons on honesty and forgiveness make this a meaningful evenings entertainment
<START> if you like your films to pull your emotions out of you if you like your films with a guy you can root for and relate to if you like your films in black and white you gotta see this film watch it from start to finish because you don't want to miss a beat it is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen then when the plot begins to unfold you will be on the edge of your seat i know i was my mother told me about this film as our family had some of the same things going on in it as the film does we loved frankie who plays the lead convincingly what ever you think about frank sinatra put that aside in the film he is skinny and he doesn't sing so keep an open mind for the era it was made in it tells a story that is still being told today in homes all across the nation and quite possibly the world please watch if you like older films give this one a try
<START> unless you want to be bored half to death i've never been a fan of gus van sant and as part of what previous posters have described as the new youth generation i was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film especially as they were used to string along the film's ridiculous storyline which is pretty much enforcing to the viewing masses that are social rejects and should be blamed for crimes as a skater myself i watch a lot of skate films and the filming during the skate scenes which is obviously a major part of the plot as the lead protagonist is a skateboarder was awful and bourne identity esquire shaky camera technique was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect this film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the soundtrack which just adds to the media myth that all are white rockers simply just a really bad film
<START> most of kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me meant to expand mind and soul the characters are not very believable are idealized are schematic nevertheless the way kieslowski presents their winding ways through life their complicated interaction with others with the universe with chance or destiny makes me understand faith makes me want to believe in god that at some point it all has a meaning if not to me then certainly to someone br br trois and especially rouge comes closer to making me touch feel experience the truth the meaning than perhaps any other of his films the only problem being the paths of the puzzles explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable there is still plenty of joy to be had here it is like a familiar brand of wine you know what to expect and it delivers sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging either the wine or yourself
<START> walking with dinosaurs is an amazing documentary educational for both the ignorant of dinosaurs and dinosaur lovers like myself alike i admit i was very young when i saw this on discovery but i was obsessed with it immediately spoliers the series contains 6 episodes going from the late when dinosaurs were just first evolving to the late at the end of reign of the dinosaurs when i first saw this film it was like i really had traveled back in time the majesty of the the adventures of and the caring mother version of t rex all astounded my family and me it is an amazing film and i believe that bbc managed to do just what they set out to do awesome job
<START> i have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace it was amazing the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects br br the story line is something new to naruto but it is basically the same as the first movie in the series u see them fight against other ninjas but in the movies 1 2 u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction it is nice to see them fighting something other then ninja and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra and how other people from other land across the ocean fight also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her she have truly become strong it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i'm watching now when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound with new and in the movie u know it is good and the music was good as well but i find it to be lacking something but the ending theme song was a plus dong dang i think was a really good song i totally recommend it br br all in all i give this movie a 10 because i just love it if u do decide to watch it enjoy it lol
<START> as a big dostoyevsky fan i had always been disappointed with hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the russian romantic aesthetic case in point yul brynner as karamazov i had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions but then i saw yul as major and changed my mind when given an intelligent script to work with he suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a neurotic russian officer to be so he was a better as major than he was as but that's because writer tabori actually gave yul as the conflicted russian officer the kind of conflicted russian officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them for example a of folk music he says you hear a man crying in the dark and if you listen carefully enough you know what he cries for you look surprised lady despite what you may have heard tractors and marxism aren't the only things the russian cares for there is always time for music br br brilliant
<START> for those unfamiliar with paddy this is a very good introduction while deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death beyond that some insights into view of life in general are the movie as well the 20th century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the united states in the history of the world if it turns out that the contribution to the arts by the united states was in the dimension of the 'movie ' this is a prime example of that art
<START> oh dear this was quite possibly the worst film i have seen in years i mean what more can be done with the old woman inside mans body storyline it was full of cliches eg the nerd coming into his own sequence the lad getting whats coming to him etc im not calling these spoilers because any one could guess what happens the only thing it had going for it was laura fraser who gave an average performance and as for the dream boy that was the piece of acting ever even the bad guys were instantly forgettable br br terrible movie
