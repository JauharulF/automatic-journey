<START> ah such an original title for a very shoddy film the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match as a result i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end the aztec ceremony had me laughing i rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever the singing aztec lady is comic and the dancing and costumes are a hoot some guy gets a face full of acid there's a lot of fighting you have no idea who any character is not that i really cared and it's a whole noir mess oh and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile so during the movie feel free to get up take a nap take a trip you won't miss anything exciting
<START> to speak relatively if one were only to see now hector pixote 1981 brazil pronounced as pi shot after having seen quite a number of films that deal with street children juvenile delinquents kids in trouble truffaut's the 400 blows bunuel's los olvidados de sica's nair's salaam bombay bresson's leaf on a pillow etc one might be afraid that the plight of the kid portrayed in the film might not affect one anymore having been de synthesized already after going through the emotional roller coaster ride put in motion by the previously quoted films br br thankfully that won't be the case for narrates his film in such a matter of fact manner artlessly as one film reviewer put it in a positive light and that his central child performer fernando ramos da silva 13 years old at that time and a street kid himself gives such a no frills wounded performance raw in its simplicity that hardened face those lonely and longing eyes that one is hard put not to be pierced in any way such a feeling may achieve such a heightened realism when one learns that the child had only lived but a short life having been involved in street crimes after the film and subsequently murdered br br in about first half of the film pixote and his fellow street kids and delinquents spend their time in a repressive state run reformatory school where and humiliation rape and murder are the norm and culture where they are forced to confess to their crimes on the flimsy notion that under the brazilian law underage felons are not punishable for their offenses for these kids the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation provided by these supposed well meaning authorities within the walls of this supposed protective establishment these young souls are soon to discover that love and care from parental figures are likewise nowhere to be found if not to a degree worser br br for pixote the only form of escape comes from puffing grass and sniffing glue secretly smuggled inside the reformatory br br when the kids burst themselves into a small scale revolt to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to get back to the outside world their home the intensity and form are of such a kind that one can't avoid thinking of the revolt in jean vigo's influential zero for conduct it's only that in pixote the uprising is made to appear on a gutter level br br once pixote and his small group are back on the streets the film's second half they engage in robbery pimping and drug dealing to fend for themselves along which they get to meet a battered but kindly prostitute willingly the four lost souls in such a way that she allows her customers to be robbed by them and that she provides more than motherly care at least to one of the children br br one would have thought that the street kids have at long last found the one person who can provide them the love and warmth that have been sorely lacking in their lives but as dubious as the freedom that these kids believe the streets are providing this new found maternal figure cannot but stay forever br br jealousy squabbles differences and murder have only set the kids apart and for good and during that defining scene where pixote prompted by the circumstance gets to shoot not just arrogant american customer but also his fellow street urchin ditto more than a son to he thereafter literally goes back to infancy as he sucks from the right breast of the disoriented woman right there and then materializing his lingering desire for parental affection the image itself both sad and unsettling br br it is so that in a probable coming back to her senses lamentably pushes back pixote from his nourishing position and rejects him for good thus in a quietly wrenching moment pixote with that young old face and those sullen eyes not entirely dissimilar though in a different context to the young boy's in elem klimov's harrowing come and see gets himself up puts on his coat and takes his gun yes a gun and sets off to nowhere walking along the train tracks and with the morning light just beginning to show up with that scene may just be doing an homage amongst many other homages found in different films to the iconoclastic final scene in truffaut's the 400 blows br br but whereas we got to know what has become of antoine doinel three years later in the short film antoine et colette as well as in three other feature films in the years thereafter we are left grappling in the dark as to what lies ahead for pixote after he finally disappears from the last frame that being the last time that we'll get to see this real life street child notwithstanding the fate that eventually befell him in actuality br br pixote may not be as nearly as whimsical as the 400 blows or as hallucinatory as los olvidados but it still stands out among films of similar theme and texture because of its simple raw power
<START> a group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a halloween party they get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened the possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by angela mimi kinkade who floats and talks in a really deep voice the remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house br br this is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include linnea quigley who has a couple nude scenes as usual gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple there's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out this is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza the terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though overall i would give it a 7 out of 10
<START> because it's late and i'm running short on vocabulary i will describe this film as beautiful and heartbreaking begging the forgiveness of those who cringe at such cliches robin tunney does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the clutches of tourette's syndrome her character was absolutely sincere and convincing and i will follow her career wherever it goes because of this film
<START> i've already seen spin offs of cartoons such as the flintstones scooby doo tom and jerry and looney tunes and most of them are great br br when i saw the all grown up pilot in 2001 i thought it was interesting to see how the rugrats would look in their pre teens teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert going to school and being grounded br br the actual tv show is better because the rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and angelica doesn't get punished as much as she did in the original rugrats series tommy and susie get punished in this series br br i've also noticed references to rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the rugrats looked in the original series they actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older br br this show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original rugrats viewers of the original show may like this
<START> ah when good actors take on bland material if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed while the situations are very true to life the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion much of the dialog is just plain silly br br but if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it then you will love this movie sam elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one note character of detective falon come alive with depth and pathos those of you who have never seen elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film and also in his early fifties in this film he looks fantastic his bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere esai morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as det eager beaver new police partner he could have easily played it as a robin to elliott's batman but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into this role he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say br br paul sorvino is fun to watch he plays the eccentric police captain he seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it he makes it fun for us too br br this movie is very by the numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do
<START> is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young judy garland fourteen years old singing with a slightly older by one year deanna durbin but i must disagree with everything else he or she said including the running time which is only about ten minutes not twenty a single reeler br br the song is not her best obviously but it's enjoyable and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch on turner the duet with durbin is quite interesting two conflicting styles that nevertheless dovetail reasonably well br br the short is just a throwaway but it's nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer made it out to be honestly i enjoyed it br br ab hugh
<START> the premise of the movie had much going for it however despite the novelty of models selling off someone else's furniture to live the high life this movie has nothing going for it the characters are cardboard the dialog is so painfully scripted it's hard to sit through and if there were any jokes in the movie i missed them marilyn monroe's walking into walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable not funny grable's stupidity is also too ham fisted to be believed bacall's gold digging is so forced it's annoying to listen to why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me
<START> this is a very unusual film which starts out with a rich dude getting a brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take it for a spin in the local town rich boy meets poor girl in is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out there is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the rich boy and poor boy wind up having to do community service as ordered by the town judge rich boy and poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life poor girl says some people go through life and never find love i can say that i found love and am holding on to it you will need some if you are sensitive there are plenty of romantic scenes and i doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end the producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film if you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects this is your film
<START> after receiving a dvd of this with a sunday newspaper i hoped that it was not the usual duff films that are given away because no one would ever buy them i was wrong acting is on par with that of a ten year old in a school pantomime production and the same goes for the majority of the cast neill is satisfactory but plays a russian and isn't helped by his hybrid northern irish new zealand accent and nor are the rest of the kgb characters all of whom sound like they're in a cambridge reunion in fact the only people with genuine accents are extras who supply an odd word here and there helpfully letting us know at least where the hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash the espionage factor is unimpressive for the most part and primarily consists of sheen about in various ridiculous disguises whilst trying to blend into the background quickly becoming not only boring but laughable the plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements this could have been so much better
<START> an entertaining first draft for north by northwest saboteur has some wonderful hitchcockian moments one of the best occurs at a table when the hero is asked by a woman who hasn't yet seen that he's wearing handcuffs to give her a plate trying to do that he also drops a knife to the floor exposing himself even more but suffers from a poorly chosen lead whether he's delivering patriotic speeches romancing priscilla lane making jokes or trying to look worried robert cummings is wooden and from a lack of really distinct villains oh there are villains many of them but hardly anyone has enough screen time
<START> a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of despite warnings by the local sheriff murphy john phillip law old man prichard richard lynch a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible wanted posters and kooky superstitious aunt nelly karen black to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's jeff conaway daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft these people only see the green not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies finding the gold of stone intact they line their pockets and carrying cases prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead but when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods the obvious result will be gruesome death stone as we see is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up the underneath awaiting it's master with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition his eyes with wrath this hapless group hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle directing it's path straight into her neck another failed attempt to retreat has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm another a local girl searching for her new friends worried about their well being receives the buried into her stomach aunt nelly informs those still alive about the forty and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash and pays the price for relating such information will anybody survive or is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner br br make up effects artist and monster creator john carl directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story telling opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path he provides just enough back story and this is feeble at best for the killer allowing special guest star karen black oh how her career has sunken into the abyss to explain to the viewer about him the story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage threatening to execute her as the authorities warn against such an action startling enough stone plants that right into her back with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan retreating to his domain the mine shaft stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his the loot typical of most slashers in general this bunch of twenty somethings are your garden variety victims with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them they are the usual group from the city trespassing unto unfamiliar territory resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant like many of the later 80's slashers a good deal of the violence is off screen what is on screen the minimal gore is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly the ghoul make up for the killer is only shown occasionally he's mostly shrouded in darkness the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction one thing's for certain stunt men were set on fire many times at least three times a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle martin cove has a minor cameo as black's former husband caleb now living with a much younger and dense honey vernon wells of the road warrior and commando fame has the back story role of stone as a human still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods has quite an attractive cast of actresses all wearing tight pants and shirts showing off their sleek and athletic figures especially elina madison as easy lay roxann always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk hayden rick stephen the ghosts of edendale is axl a rather clumsy foil used as a butt of many jokes including his dump in the woods scene and current unemployment status
<START> this opens with the company credits informing us it s by world international network i knew i d seen this company credit before but couldn t remember where but knew it was at the start of a really bad movie i d seen so i seriously thought about changing channels only thing was i d seen every film on the other channels which is one of the problems of being an imdb reviewer what the hell i thought it won t really matter if wanted is good or bad because i ll still be able to review it for this site br br as i expected wanted wasn t all that good it s a plot i d seen so many times too many times before involving a fugitive on the run a bit like the incredible hulk tv series without the shirt ripping jimmy crosses the mob in an entirely contrived way and goes on the run and in an entirely contrived manner finds himself working at a catholic reform school have you noticed an oft used description in the last sentence entirely contrived is the answer let me repeat for the hard of thinking that this is an entirely contrived film where everything relies on coincidence another problem i had was the reform school run by the church it s far too compassionate and kind i m led to believe these type of establishments make alcatraz look like a country club i m saying this is a fact but when the head priest looks like the spitting image of donald rumsfeld you do feel there s a large amount of sugar coating going on br br to be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists etc wanted isn t really a bad thriller though it s a terribly good one either i never really had the urge to switch it off no matter how contrived it became which is an under hand compliment to the movie
<START> what a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the golden gate bridge of san francisco in this exciting action picture although the characters and the story are in fact bad it still has a certain cult flair
<START> i rented this movie today worst movie ever it was a total waste of time and a horrible story the acting was horrible especially by the actress of sai she was so bad it was ridiculous i can't tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place i can't even get my mind wrapped around just how awful and pointless this whole movie was i'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it br br if you're looking for a good vampire horror flick this is not the movie for you move right along it's a waste of time and money heck i wouldn't even download this movie if someone paid me br br this movie is so bad it doesn't even deserve a 1 i wish i could give it a 0
