<START> though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance i don't think bergman's movies can be easily classed under narrow genres even the lightest are quite complex this movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc i don't really communicate personally with all these issues as i am sure others do but the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary you almost wish it not to end i have to admit that i was swept away by the bergman of the fifties having come to know most of his later groundbreaking efforts before nykvist von sydow etc the master produced some of the richest warm and touching movies i have ever seen though it's a long shot i have seen this kind of love for human kind in its complexity only in fellini's movies of the same period a lesson in love alongside smiles of a summer night are worth seeing for bergman fans to have the full image of the man's capabilities and for those who love cinema with a heart may he rest in peace
<START> i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up in addition i liked the carry through of the billy boy song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie the title sarah plain and tall however the one thing in winter's end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter she was a very cute little girl but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids even compared to talkative but still good natured caleb when he was younger
<START> i just got the dvd for hardware wars in a shiny new package looking irresistable stuck it in my dvd player to find a slew of extra fun stuff the extra content on the dvd is even longer than the movie for those of you that have shame never seen hardware wars it one fantastically silly star wars spoof of episode iv of course household appliances such as irons toasters vacuums and a waffle maker stand in for ty fighters x wings r2d2 and the death star instead of princess leia we have princess ann droid complete with hairdo you get the point i'm sure mad silliness and a fun ride for any star wars geek like me br br now the dvd wow a director's commentary where he basically goes off on the movie making fun of himself and the project throughout an interview with on creature features remember that and hilarious director's cut and foreign version of the movie all jokes of course anyway this is great i loved hardware wars in the theater and am so glad for having the dvd in my collection wedged in between mst3k the movie and thumb wars
<START> man is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than flighty nikki newman a doctor with a brain no less and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous lorenzo lamas instead of victor newman br br mel plays a college professor of micro biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus handy for her there is the hunky character played by lorenzo who has a daughter just her son's age br br mel shines as does lorenzo with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk worthwhile seeing especially for y r fans
<START> i don't know where most of you were at but where i watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced we had people laughing mostly at the campy plot line the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of brosnan the only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs i was a dj in the seventies and even went to the abba concert at coliseum in edmonton in sept of 79 so i did appreciate them then and i still do now but this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce the sequences were so poorly staged the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be meryl's worst production i cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage so save your money wait for it to come out on dvd and then maybe spend your money on something better like cat litter
<START> the only good thing of this movie is its final twist in 97 minutes of film we can only save one single idea which was totally wasted in this movie i must say for more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clichÃ©s bad acting stupid ideas and disclosures complete lack of suspense stupid deaths terrible special effects all this in a pathetic and unoriginal until the last three minutes where finally a good idea appeared it's nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea but at least was a decent good idea the only one the entire movie has i won't spoil it but i must say i think that idea with a better plot better fx and definitely a better acting would turn into a good film if you watch this movie and can stand it until the end you will know what it
<START> except for the glossy look this show had little to recommend it the writing was patronizing and convoluted without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic the female characters came off the worst reduced to spoiled selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and and try to bag a man this aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women the acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note this is not entirely the actors fault had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline adding a little injection of style and humour mvp might have been a hit what we're left with is something flat and vaguely unpleasant
<START> this enjoyable euro western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that sergio leone wanted to shoot for once upon a time in the west but couldn't persuade clint eastwood to appear in three tough looking gunfighters ride into a town one is dressed like the man with no name in a poncho another is dressed like colonel mortimer from for a few dollars more and the third is garbed like django except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it our hero meets them in main street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins any gun can play is a spaghetti western with an in joke on spaghetti westerns since the hero here wipes out the three killers aside from a little too much comedy especially in the acrobatic fight sequences this is an above average oater br br the notorious mexican outlaw gilbert roland of and his gang of trigger happy rob an army train transporting 300 thousand dollars in gold coins across the frontier director enzo g castellari of inglorious bastards stages the hold up from a variety of camera angles that thrust you into the forefront of the action the bandits seize the locomotive along with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the u s cavalry while and his gunmen keep the cavalry pinned down pedro sanchez of the locomotive kills the engineer and his crew and trundles it away leaving the other behind to fend for themselves essentially double crosses and steals the gold for himself later catches up with at the rio grande before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the loot to however a cavalry sergeant shoots dead before he dies tells about a medallion that serves as a clue about where he stashed the treasure the irate cavalry captain of commandos imprisons but he cannot loosen the tongue even after he uses his whip on him infuriated by reticence the captain threatens to have the mexican shot if he doesn't talk meanwhile the let a priest speak to but he really isn't a priest the six gun toting stranger george hilton of the ruthless four masquerades as a man of the cloth and rescues from a firing squad unfortunately before is rescued clayton edd byrnes of tv's 77 sunset strip takes the medallion away from him and keeps it for himself clayton is the bank representative that was sent to safeguard the gold he is horrified that the captain wants to shoot clayton's career at the bank hinges on his ability to recover the gold the stranger stages a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and takes the captain as hostage and tries to escape but the stranger shoots him off the horse before the authorities can verify that is dead the stranger claims the body for the handsome reward he will receive and he rides out with the captain's gracious thanks no sooner have they left the fort than men show up to rescue him from the stranger from this point on the stranger and clayton forge short lived alliances among each other as they search for the gold castellari and scenarist tito who has penned a number of spaghetti westerns such as a few dollars for django and another castellari oater seven for a massacre rely on clever humor and surprise reversals to keep the action fresh and fast paced one cool scene has clayton seated at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds from behind him clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the gunmen behind him with six guns br br any gun can play lives up to its title in fact many guns do play and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fade out this western isn't so much a parody as it is a knock off of sergio leone's the good the bad and the ugly mind you bad guys and good guys fall as frequently as ten pins in a bowling alley but their deaths aren't depicted in the brutal fashion of a leone western any gun can play doesn't take itself as seriously as the aforementioned leone masterpiece the three leads jockey back and forth for supremacy each has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure but they refuse to share their information until the shoot'em up finale lenser giovanni colorful widescreen photography is spectacular especially the opening shots of the train along railway tracks with distant mountain peaks up dramatically in the background another great shot occurs when tests the stranger's imperturbable calm this scene happens after the stranger has rescued and the minions arrive to save their bacon confiscating the stranger's six gun takes aim at the poncho clad tough guy and empties the revolver placing his well aimed bullets harmlessly in and around the unflinching gunslinger who photographed world war ii thriller inglorious bastards frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his pistol in hand in the foreground for a pleasing three dimensional style shot meanwhile francesco de lively orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for its own idiosyncratic melodies as ennio morricone's soundtracks were for the leone westerns the opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs although it isn't a major spaghetti western any gun can play is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances especially the indefatigable gilbert roland who was 62 years old at the time
<START> warning spoilers although it's hard to spoil this film by telling story details br br eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone it's very old and it's er clumsy what makes it great for me is the soundtrack not the original but the updated soundtrack better still the orchestral version created my favorite performance is by fritz reiner and the chicago symphony br br the film is actually funny in places it's reminiscent of the old midsummer night's dream some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent some of the actors are also quite magnificent the actor who played nevsky could have been a superstar today ditto for the warrior chick definitely a rocker br br this may be the world's best collection on film of pithy russian sayings there are tons of them they make up the bulk of the spoken lines br br the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high budget hollywood flix these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be the weapons look nasty so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another br br the actor playing the german grand marshall is trying really hard to look scary early in the film but he looks like he was really a pussycat after he's captured he looks so pathetic speaks volumes about the intended audience da br br a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an organ with it played by a character in a black robe watch the russians bring this guy down while he's playing br br after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film and the music the song sung to the dead soldiers who've died defending the motherland this part is so sad it's almost an anti war statement br br ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film wonder why br br warning joseph stalin liked this film ironic he killed more russians than anybody those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword
<START> valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart i would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen sex comedies but that is a back handed compliment this is a good movie period it is very specific in time and place nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot yet its story remains timeless this is just romeo and juliet minus the death after all nicolas cage is wonderful showing all the early promise that it turns out he has squandered on overblown action crapola deborah foreman is the revelation of this movie and i can't believe she didn't go on to have a bigger career someone rediscover her quick this is sweeter and gentler than most films of the genre the requisite nudity seems thrown in by contractual obligation and while not groundbreaking it certainly is nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and doesn't crucify its shallow young girls for having fun even foreman's crew of best friends misguided by peer pressure are never presented as villains indeed her friend stacy forced to w cage's friend fred has a good time despite her protests and makes out w fred in the backseat this will take you back to the early 80's if you were there but it holds up quite well today warning to those unfamiliar with the movie do not watch one of vh1's seemingly continual showings of it go rent it in its unedited glory otherwise you are missing some of the movies' most potent time specific dialogue and one can't write about valley girl and not mention the soundtrack of great 80's tunes most of them by one hit wonders which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie but thematically well chosen see it awesome little flick fer
<START> this is one of my favorite series all categories all time br br i was fortunate enough to get a hold of the whole series on vhs a few years ago i loved it when i saw it back in 91 92 when i was about 12 i love it as much or more today which is remarkable considering my hopefully improved film appreciation and criticism skills most of the movies i liked back then i'm not that fond of today besides for the nostalgia factor that factor is present here as well but there's so much more to robin of sherwood than nostalgia br br there are only a few bad things about this series first the picture and sound quality is so so at least in the first couple of episodes fortunately it gets better secondly you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes although i know that was not an option in this case br br so on to the good things and there are a lot of them first of all michael is robin hood i don't think i have seen him in a single role since then which only strengthen this fact for me he delivers such a believable performance as robin jason connery had an impossible task replacing him the fact that michael hasn't become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable or perhaps that was his fate to do this one role perfectly then disappear br br i love nickolas graces sheriff of nottingham he is really not a complex character but totally rotten the relation between him and is just hilarious actually just looking at de sitting in his throne bored glaring makes me laugh even before he has said anything another actor that deserves extra praise is ray winstone as will scarlet you can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife winstone is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved hollywood breakthrough in films as the departed and beowulf there are a lot of other great actors here too br br i love the portrayal of the robin gang they are having fun playing laughing you really get a feel of the camaraderie between them the closeness that comes from a tight bound group such as this those bonding scenes are so important br br i think that it being uk produced with british actors really made it better compared to for example the 92 feature film version with kevin costner that just feels fake fake fake christian slater as will scarlet come on the cast being able to speak english with british accent makes it more believable and i get the feeling that the actors as well as the director and writers behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the robin hood gang than an american crew could have the music is wonderful is perfect for the feel of the series the music is another of those things they just nailed br br an exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there it's not over the top but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting i also love how nicely the mix of comedy adventure and drama is blended br br those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine it's by far the best robin hood version i have ever seen i won't wrap up with the nothing's forgotten quote but one thing that never will be forgotten for me is this fantastic robin hood retelling see it
<START> usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a descending pattern this bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive the acting save for the male antagonist was awful the plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene which is probably good as performance art but it was wasted in this movie not sure why this movie was made
<START> i live in mexico city so i have to suffer the trailers for every piece of trash that comes out from all these stupid mexican filmmakers you want to admire a mexican guy for making great films take a look at something by guillermo del toro specially the devil's backbone or maybe alfonso cuarÃ³n though i really don't like his films but i respect them br br mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most terrible utter trash ever por la libre el segundo aire american visa but this is one of the lowest points in mexican films ever if you respect your brain please avoid this piece of at all costs it would be more intelligent to watch some video of a wedding or to watch britney's reality show that's got more iq than everyone in this 'film'
<START> this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back vinnie jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the and the camera work were appalling quite why this and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish
<START> this is a movie that deserves another look if you haven't seen it for a while or a first look if you were too young when it came out 1983 based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors the young able bodied ones being taken for military service it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his dresser so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth while tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater especially shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity the backstage goings on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers
