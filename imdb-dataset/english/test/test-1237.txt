<START> i'm 35 bruce was the man in evil dead and i still love to watch and it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in bubba ho tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for bruce's early fans either i'm getting too old for this or i'm just not part of bruce's target audience anymore i'm positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film but this over extended matinÃ©e sci fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor campbell better talk seriously with sam raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest at least there would be a good director behind the camera sorry bruce this just doesn't cut it for me take care
<START> wow when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for this movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the term sigourney weaver was better than i've seen from her in years emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart i can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family don't get me wrong it's really funny too at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again i just think if you're open to examining your own life imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you i can't wait until it comes out in theaters
<START> the usual disclaimer i do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless bad low budget and silly although they may deserve it these films are often funny and get rated 2 4 based on entertainment value not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry this film fits this model perfectly it is a mexican monster movie riddled with voice over narrative and extremely weak not so special effects the makeup is not that bad and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining but this film is almost as silly as aliens vs predator and the script isn't half as slick aliens vs predator might get a 1 from me but i want to see it again before i commit br br the plot is ridiculous but deliciously convoluted if you've read this far you must really want to know a group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters most of them are heroes sort of but one is of course mad and quite perverse this mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot who looks a bit like the tin man from wizard of oz but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head an aztec mummy discovered by the same whose wife just so happens to have been an aztec princess in a past life don't ask is pitted against the robot for the big climax the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs br br for what its worth given the budget and the utter silliness of the script this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie if you're into that sort of thing go for it
<START> the main premise for this movie is every woman's fantasy a vagina that kills and eats men well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man what's that 99 9999 of women but don't worry it's not a gory kind of eating of men it's more like a comical slurping them in like a drain plug there's no blood or parts left behind so for blood guts gore fans forget about this film not much gore here br br the two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute meanwhile dennis is a nice guy who stalks helen br br the story is already a little silly at this point but then they throw in two more equally silly sub stories that just send this movie into the bad b movie territory the first new sub story is about dennis finding new love with a pair of conjoined twins and then eventually murdering one of them and becoming a fugitive bank robber the second new sub story is about helen finding new love with a nice policeman who rescued her from a prostitution related bad date and decided he wanted to marry her dennis and helen eventually meet up again at the end of movie in totally unbelievable circumstances and magically helen's murderous vagina is cured
<START> this extraordinary pseudo documentary made in 1971 perfectly captures the zeitgeist of america today which makes it all the more scary and relevant subversives college students hippies black activists academics are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest as an alternative to life in prison these convicted criminals are offered three days in punishment park their objective inside the park is to make their way to the american flag where freedom awaits them not surprisingly the punishment park option is a dirty lie this brilliant film from peter even pre dates battle royale and series 7 though its angle of attack is more blatantly political shot in '71 it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today the performances are exemplary and the direction is razer sharp the narrative cuts back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the mccarthy like trials that convicted them today this film still retains its power in '71 there was nothing but nothing quite like it this is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels it has the balls that most people today have lost
<START> this early film from director bob clark porky's black christmas a christmas story didn't really pump my nads like i expected in fact it straight up annoyed me it's about a theater troupe who sail to a burial island consisting of dead criminals where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect some corpses the leader of their group a conceited black magic enthusiast and possible homosexual attempts to summon satan's help with the re animation of an exhumed body which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby deserted house and play with it nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the the make up effects are okay the gore is very minimal pg rating and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much which really got on my nerves i guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some comedic status yet i found no humor in it whatsoever the entire concept is just ridiculous how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring don't waste your time with it
<START> here's example number 87 of hollywood's anti biblical bias so typical of them br br early on ray liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper the first interviewee is an old fashioned looking dress mannerisms speech who immediately lays down here strict rules stating that there will be two hours of bible study ever day br br this is said of course to make it sound like reading the bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone especially a kid once again the bible is equated with stuffy mean spirited people that woman of course is dismissed immediately br br naturally the liberal black woman whoopi goldberg who else is the one who is hired and voilÃ  saves the day br br yawn
<START> as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance i cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct to video grade c porn movie in which either a the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts an amazing thing if it were true br br i had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i had rented it which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs which seemed to imply a john waters style humor fest with a sexual theme okay i laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way but on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctly on this one you fast forward because you already know what they're about to say but there's nothing to fast forward to so just fast forward past it on the shelf
<START> spoilers spoilers some bunch of hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area spoilers the dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick and cracks it open then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and surprise something eats him the other two are not seen alive again scott looks like a pizza delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree which means he should be about 35 years old minimum is supposed to join camp c and help them find diamonds the truck that picks up to take him to camp c has a handful of the kind of that usually populate movies like pitch black the thing etc the truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up since they were travelling the same road so they find the eaten bodies and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them the main lunatic in the group karl decides that they must find the killer so the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert the dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around when he takes a nap wearing the same jacket the creatures eat him alive and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that dummy loses his arm too sounds exciting so far except that a few minutes later dr realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive because the miners cracked open the old hive now last time i checked ants could move around on their own without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure if all they need was something hard they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form the whole story is really really dumb and the ant explanation is the only one given the rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant nest and kill the ant brain sort of and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty bitty feet there is a spare ant brain found off camera and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel
<START> i'm glad that i did not expect too much when i saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films the storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters and i was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel i also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film charlie had changed and now he has a girlfriend the first film had some good music but the music in this film was unmemorable in short this film just did not do it for me and looking at other user feedback it looks like it didn't do it for a lot of you it's not worth watching
<START> br br this movie being one of them br br i remember in the middle of the movie me and my friend just br br looked at each other our heads and laughed in despair br br see it if you wish if you feel that you have the time to waste br br and donÂ´t mind 1 5 hrs of catatonia
<START> i first viewed they died with there boots on about 1970 and though it has been many years since this film and its impression remain the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi documentary with other great directors like vincent wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable yet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of 34 much has been made of custer's final class ranking but of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day june 24 1861 it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident his squadron would follow him to hell your at attention sargeant reprimands tape if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable to not only sheridan but forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the under general george there is some truth to the audacity attributed to battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels audacity shone through he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers including a rebel captain yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise robert l bateman armchair general there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that indeed was an active young officer he was not with union forces at either or for that matter however he was with them at the battle of and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general but that was not to last as was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the had the means and the information discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lee's plans to split his forces and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg pa his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some 6 000 rebels with but a force of 2 300 i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion there is speculation had in the movie that appointment was a blunder well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments though custer was severely for that kind of when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe the truth be told defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and protected that this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it
<START> jack frost returns with an army of styrofoam balls that can only be foiled by being shot with super loaded with margaritas how's that for a plot the film hinges on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with bbq tongs and are impaled by carrots you might even say the whole movie is skating on thin ice ba boom tish br br admittedly there are some fantastic one liners including a remark about the murderous coconut shark br br fair enough times are hard but that does not excuse the willingness of the actors to take part in such utter tripe br br for those fans hoping to see jack frost be prepared to accept him as merely a phallic carrot creeping up the beach with corny voice over commentary
<START> 1st watched 8 26 2001 8 out of 10 dir john cassavetes well done early independent film by cassavetes introduced a style that was much different than what hollywood shows it's audience this movie also introduced some very taboo subjects especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time about the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whites aka sidney poitier besides this the idea of ending a film without truly concluding the relationships that began leaves many moviegoers dumbfounded but actually makes the viewers realize that life is like this it goes on i prefer this kind of an ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you the movie follows the lives of people particulary a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happen to be opposite skin colors then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what he's done this is done very well and makes the movie very special the acting is supposedly done improvisationally which makes the movie even more amazing i guess you can say i liked this movie if you can't tell if you can find it check out this classic early independent film
