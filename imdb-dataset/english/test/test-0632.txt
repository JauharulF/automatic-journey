<START> emotionally insecure tom russo asbestos felt reads the secret diary of his sexy wife courtney and is dismayed to discover that the love of his life has apparently been sleeping with every bloke she meets this shocking revelation sends poor tom off his rocker and he proceeds to wreak bloody revenge on the men who he believes have been his old lady br br in my experience really really bad films can often be as much fun as really good ones and no film featuring a decapitation by machete enhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely worthless but even though killing spree very occasionally manages to entertain with its inventiveness and cheap and cheerful gore i found that the terrible direction awful production values ugly cinematography muffled sound dreadful lighting mind numbingly tedious and daft narrative which includes a really dumb plot twist that is telegraphed from the beginning plus a pointless zombie finale nasty synthesizer score inane dialogue and thoroughly amateurish acting all served to make this effort from writer director tom ritter a virtually joyless experience
<START> the tagline on the box hails 100 trapped passengers 3 000 venomous vipers you almost have to admire that degree of no chance in hell we're ever going to deliver on this promise bullshit i could admire the more so if they made movies that well you know were good or at the very least worth a damn haha and it's what i like about theses movies they are garbage you put them in a toilet and then you flush it worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies it may become a cult classic among many fans the gore scenes are there's not much i can say it's a z flick that parody the new movie with samuel l jackson hell it may be better so who knows
<START> a sci fi network original not the best not far from being the worst an electrician richard grieco stumbles onto a key that can open a gateway to a parallel earth that has been taken over by mutant spiders the mutations have been controlled by a super sized alien queen for the past thirty years she has already eaten up the population of this parallel world that resembles chicago minus inhabitants guess what now she must find another world to feed on the electrician leads a four man team that reluctantly finds themselves with the task of saving the world the finale confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie the cast also features richard colin fox kate greenhouse jason jones and david newman one would have thought that the sci fi network could have spent more money on special effects
<START> for real though this game is where it's at i'm 20 years old and that's basically where it started for me 4 bit graphics was fabulous i hope you all remember this game with as much adoration as i do that bluto is a real
<START> strike force or the librarians is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously william forsythe stars as simon who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client he meets up with erika eleniak who is also looking for someone her sister but there are evil bad guys afoot the most evil of them all is marcos andrew divoff marcos likes to kill people so now simon and have to team up to bring down the villains the whole cast is great with divoff stealing the movie there are also cameos by ed lauter and burt reynolds if you are looking for a good action film watch this and have a good time
<START> if you need that instant buzz that only late 60s early 70s euro sex movies can give off then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother lode subsequent tv director exercise in psychedelic porn of the soft core variety may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of brass jess franco and joe d'amato for a loop radley metzger sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this marvelously twisted little number for us distribution through his company gorgeous cinematography symmetrical compositions may elicit cries of from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone's backyard hey as far as i'm concerned it's their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so well twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen dagmar lassander immortalized as the gone to seed landlady from lucio fulci's house by the cemetery has never looked more exquisite than she does here subtly portraying the innocent researcher held hostage by mad medic philippe leroy with all the art house favorites to his name you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c v as their initially violent 'relationship' turns to s m tinged love story nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity i for one was completely baffled and enchanted by the way chose to suggest oral sex during one scene i'll let you find that one out for yourselves and gauze clad boogie to an impossibly groovy 60s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of sylvia kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her emmanuelle days you may not know this film just yet but trust me once seen you'll never forget it
<START> sometimes i think that somewhere in the lifetime channel's office complex there is a room where the writer's hang out with a large wheel on the wall sort of like the big six ones in casinos the latter have a lot of spots where you win even money and fewer for higher amounts until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks br br but i picture the channel's wheel having about six different genres on its wheel with two of them appearing the most labeled the psychotic neighbor or the spouse with a hidden past or secret or both lifetime movies have a few repetitive story lines and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous br br the spouse category can have a spouse of long standing but some person appears or an event occurs exposing that the good wife was once a hooker one of the couple was involved in some nefarious act long ago or that something else in one of the background in different than presumed etc etc or as in this flick one of them has entered the marriage with the most nefarious of aims br br one constant in all of their genres is that the husband or other males are usually clueless vacuous and slow to have any idea what in the hell is going until the climax or at best very late in the proceedings unless the male is the miscreant not the case here br br whether the referenced miscreant might be the neighbor or as in this offering the wife it is always fascinating how easily successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their dastardly deeds they manipulate many of the others whack them as necessary assume various poses and juggle more deceptions than you can count with unfailing success until just before the end br br the lead actor here like many in this channel's movies is an old hand i noticed that another film in which he starred was titled the perfect neighbor br br finally the vengeful perfect wife in this flick dispatches those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent button man in don corleone's family could muster and i couldn't help but imagine that jack melvin character fro as good as it gets with his massive ocd affliction could provide counsel to the anti heroine to assist in dealing with he obsession which was the basis of this opus
<START> first of all i really can't understand how some people enjoyed this movie it's the worst thing i have ever seen even the actors seem to be bored and i think that says it all br br however i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators that team seems to have a really good future that's why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits and one or two special effects sequences if they're watched outside this movie it almost looks like a good movie br br better luck or judgment next time for the producers of this this this thing
<START> the story was disjointed the acting was not of any you can more of a serial pilot than an actual movie i wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it whatever it was that made the lost boys so likable was obviously absent here altho it tried hard plot hooks were clumsily placed amidst what could have been an episode of dawsons creek with dark clothes and the story arc was going nowhere soon very disappointing for me the end scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of the story planned his whole scheme who was he or she trying to kid talk about naive stick with films of this kind of genre from the eighties when they had more of an idea
<START> the film starts with promise because there is more interaction between spanky and buckwheat but as the film progresses the two boys have fewer scenes together this slows the pace considerably billie buckwheat thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes when he is left behind on the riverboat his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking when he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment as another reviewer mentioned i was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones once spanky and buckwheat are in marshall home spanky tends to interact mainly with the adults and the chemistry of the children is essentially lost br br the old south huck finn type setting really doesn't do much for the plot except allow the children to be out of doors a great deal ralph morgan is the most engaging adult but then the other roles really don't have much substance to them louise beavers manages some funny moments with a yankee soldier towards the end br br the villains aren't really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough yet i do think it's worth viewing if you're an our gang enthusiast if for no other reason that the odd curiosity of the whole piece i give it seven stars because while not a great movie it kept me engaged the whole time and curious as to what would happen next
<START> the movie was actually not that bad especially plot wise but the and hairy actor they chose for the leading role was a little chintzy in the acting department i would have chosen someone else the idea of going to america was very ingenious and the main character questioning everything that he'd ever known made him somewhat likable but not very much so when there's a pasty blob for a leading actor br br the storyline was interesting it brings about the question of how the subject of cloning will be handled in the future certainly cloning wouldn't be allowed for the purposes in the movie but it's still a valid argument even for today clones are still people right br br the movie wasn't particularly special but it still is a lot better than some of the cheese released during the 70s let us not forget the giant spider invasion i give it a 4 since it didn't totally stink but the mst3k version makes this movie a 10 i still like dr super mario you'll like this movie but it won't be your favorite
<START> this is clive barker's masterpiece in my opinion the movie has a great storyline and some amazing make up and effects the one thing i would love to see happen is a sequel the movie was set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie could be incredible david cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as craig sheffer but this particular movie was a great original creative and entertaining idea and i could watch it over and over again cronenberg was perfect in this movie and sheffer added an interesting spice to the film
<START> may have known what he was doing when he made but the rest of us can just sit back in and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been br br the nominal plot involves a young african singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as a mock trial against key financial institutions dealing with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa that's all well and good i suppose but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here they lose both force and impact put another way if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacks br br the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual honest to god movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for one's message
<START> i happened to leave hbo on last night following six feet under what ran next has left me speechless what an incredible piece of work i don't just recommend this i mandate that you see this it's better than anything hollywood could ever ruin i just hope they never get their hands on it
<START> hi there i watched the first part when it came out and i don't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one br br first the animation is choppy wooden not worked on lacks i understand the drawing style was to be of some kind but it could be done with the usual disney finesse see tarzan to see what i mean if i didn't see the disney logo in the beginning i would never say it was a disney movie br br second the plot was more like a pc game style like a good old quest not that it was bad but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals it was at least the film was meant for children but this was waaay to childish at times br br third the music i would say it was improper but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation br br overall i think this was some kind of an amusement just by the way kind of project by several apprentice animators just to fill in the count for disney movies sorry to hear that from myself a big disney lover
