<START> so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day the carnosaur trilogy pterodactyl raptor island then i flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous saturday prime time slot some movie i had never heard of before called raptor i was pretty excited the movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep when they get stalked and killed by a velociraptor i was like hmmm that's odd that looks almost exactly like a scene in carnosaur except it was in the middle of that movie then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was suckered into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a ferocious t rex now i'm like wait a second that was also a scene in carnosaur then after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from carnosaur 2 i figured out just what the hell was going on so basically roger corman co ripped off scenes from the carnosaur trilogy to use as the action scenes weaved in a basic dinosaur runs amok plot and tried to pass it off as an original movie shameful i don't know who i'm more angry at roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime time slot the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors actresses who looked like their counterparts in the carnosaur trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next as much as it pains me being a dinosaur lover i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off
<START> very funny film with some of the best swedish actors it's all filmed in black and white with the true 40 ish feeling most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh
<START> this is one of peter sellers' best movies why is it never shown on tv or movie theaters will it ever be released as a home movie is it too derogatory for the medical field i would love to see this movie again i would like my son who is a doctor to see it laughter is the best medicine and peter sellers is the best doctor for this
<START> so what is 'batman anyway br br it was marketed as an action film and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film but really there isn't that much action and tim burton barely seems interested in it br br people often align it with the superhero comics of the late eighties but honestly if you've read 'the dark knight that seems just a little absurd burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day glo sixties tv series the penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck for goodness' sake br br burton's style is often described as gothic and that's a little closer to what we see on screen the penguin deformed malign with a tangled history and a subterranean lair is a gothic menace dressed up in more respectable dickensian clothes masquerading as uriah heep br br but what of catwoman she may be raised from the dead but that pvc is decidedly twentieth century and her alter ego selina kyle's world is all and apartments reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy br br and then it clicks the smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire the ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise 'batman is quite clearly a romantic comedy in the old hollywood style filtered through burton's s m dungeon sensibilities it has more in common with 'the hudsucker including expressionist sets than it does with other superhero films br br like many a romantic comedy it centres around the make over of the heroine not from ugly duckling to swan but from doormat to dominatrix michelle pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her often remarkable career she's sexy as catwoman poor halle berry never had a prayer playful and vindictive memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body in retrospect though it's her scenes as selina that impress almost every one of them is a little comic gem particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life it's a delicately balanced performance and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life nothing moves me quite like selina and bruce wayne dancing under the to and the banshees a gun held between them simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos doomed to conflict forget the easy sentimentality of 'big fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'edward scissorhands' this is the most heartfelt scene in all of burton's films love revenge fatalism fetishism insanity self loathing and not a little wit all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors particularly pfeiffer br br elsewhere danny de vito almost matches her finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long johns the upper crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham burton's penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own eliza doolittle style make over almost literally an 'ugly it's burton's most radical and funniest reinvention christopher walken's max schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains sliding between casual charm and blank eyed psychosis with unnerving ease and is it just me or does his company's logo bring to mind mickey mouse perhaps we should ask former disney animator burton br br christopher nolan's 'batman a real action film has been much praised as the first film to do justice to batman i admire nolan's film but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem
<START> i just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is just br br the memory of this movie right now enchants me if you want to br br see a sweeping epic of a movie with wonderful actors in vivid br br scenery with great dialogue reminding you of what early america br br could have been like what the world could have been like back br br then well i highly recommend this movie especially during a br br time of war and conflict in iraq when our american image is not at br br all what it used to be this movie takes you back to a time when we br br were just starting out when being an american meant really br br picking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going when br br the world was such an untamed and unknown place well this br br movie has that and more enjoy
<START> a true stand out episode from season 1 is what ice is an artic location claustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia looming in the freezing air makes this is a must see episode from season one the previous occupants of the artic station mulder scully and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselves a virus is bringing out murderous aggression and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear mulder and scully actually begin to question each others sanity tension is that high the writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense mulder and scully come into conflict in such a direct manner
<START> how many ppl know about this lets keep it that way i wonder at least some new dialogues can be made or not the movie is a real poor copy of the original bruce willis probably did this movie while he was half asleep the way he looks at richard gere's face with his cold blooded stare when they meet near the port oh my god scared the hell out of me why does he kill major and her mates isn't still clear to me another thing that i could not understand was the poison solution that he put on the car what in the world was it br br the movie plot is haywire and climax is dull another funny thing was how the russian was killed in the club i fell off my chair laughing when i saw that scene also what was that thing about the gay guy what purpose was it serving i think the movie is made too swift to be easily understood you have to really think what the hell was on director's mind lol br br and the best scene after all was richard gere trying to hold on to the pillar between 2 fast moving trains must have made someone loose his head if not contact with the pillar
<START> hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of tough guy roles epic sword films and romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
<START> first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie perhaps though it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad br br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person that wasn't too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucy's entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy's life really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this movie'll be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
<START> for many years samuel tried to bring his friend jascha to the screen one evening when goldwyn and his wife frances were having dinner with and his wife silent screen star florence vidor goldwyn proposed that star in a movie after some persuasion agreed on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum and the movie originally titled music school was born br br the story itself is rather stock a streetwise boy gene reynolds who is best known as the producer of m a s h runs away from home and ends up at a financially troubled music school run by professor lawson walter brennan while attempting to raise funds for the school the boy and some other kids happen across at carnegie hall after much ado ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school br br the story while predictable is surprisingly well written although the film contains several minor gaffes where different scenes were patched together the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later br br what is not surprising is how good the acting is as was customary for studios then the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent brennan joel mccrea andrea porter hall marjorie main later of ma and pa kettle fame arthur hohl paul harvey and a who's who of character actors actress diana lynn and singer actress kaye connor made their uncredited debuts in this film as did longtime nelson eddy singing partner gale sherwood as jacqueline nash child veteran actors reynolds walter and terry also appear br br goldwyn hired the peter symphony a highly regarded youth orchestra from the los angeles area to appear in the film most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors but they were excellent musicians as good as professionals which many of them later became many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers kaye connor and diana lynn both starred in the theater and movies richard was a producer and director mitchell lurie founded a well known music supply company elliott rapaport went on to be a prominent lewis elias was a band leader thomas a conductor with different symphonies channing robbins a prominent instructor at the julliard school his sister joyce robbins an instructor suny and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major symphony orchestras br br while acting was kept to a minimum his salary wasn't he commanded 70 000 for seven weeks when some scenes had to be re shot at a later date he got an additional 50 000 for another four weeks what thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical output composer alfred neumann who was once a orchestra conductor handled the scoring performs the and rondo by camille saint his own arrangement of manuel with an off screen teddy accompanying devilishly difficult staccato from a vitaphone recording with emanuel bay at the piano an excerpt from tchaikovsky's melody an excerpt arranged for violin solo from tchaikovsky's well known from his opus 11 string quartet played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie and the final movement from felix e minor violin concerto during all of these performances there are many closeups of performing including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing something that would be of value to desiring to study his technique br br the orchestra also shines here performing the arias caro by verdi and diva by both with sherwood singing an arrangement of the overture from barber of seville a short excerpt from mozart's eine kleine nachtmusik and the previously mentioned concerto with diana lynn can be heard in the background of one scene performing part of nocturne in b flat minor and a five year old mary ruth performs popular minute waltz br br all in all this is an excellent movie amc showed this regularly up until early 1992 i haven't seen it on television in recent years but copies of it are not difficult to obtain if you have the chance i highly recommend that you view the movie
<START> peak practice was a british drama series about a gp surgery in Â a small fictional town in the peak district Â and the doctors who worked there it ran on itv from 1993 to 2002 and was one of their most successful series at the time it originally starred kevin whately as dr jack amanda burton as dr beth glover and simon shepherd as dr will preston though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the series br br the series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff viewers wrote to itv in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website peak practice online however all pleas were unsuccessful and itv said they would not make any more episodes br br peak practice was replaced by sweet medicine another medical series set in it lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules br br was based on the village of and the series was filmed there and at other nearby towns and villages most notably matlock and after the end of this programme itv attempted to launch a follow up series called sweet medicine which extended the stories of different characters from the original show
<START> this is my favorite game for the nintendo 64 platform i've played many different first person shooters and i've never really liked any of them much but this game has a certain something that i can't put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters maybe it's the gadgets and weapons maybe it's the suave character of james bond whatever it is this game never seems to get old no matter how many times i've played it
<START> although it has been a failure in movie theaters because mainly farmer one of the 3 top stars in france had not the first role fans had changed their mind after that and were waiting for it on dvd when it has been released on dvd this year it has have a tremendous success the others fails was the slow pace and the incredible length at that time 1994 that have annoyed critics but the melancholic story makes mandatory that slow pace and long time the moral of the film is you cannot escape from the death you are destined for it is the same theme than in the movie final destination and makes it a gothic tale the atmosphere is very melancholic
<START> in sudan the arabs rule and are constantly at war with the christians and who inhabit the southern portion of this east african country this film follows a group of of boys a tribe of cattle whom were left orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by the arab forces most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed the lost boys br br the filmmaker follows a group of the lost boys on their journey as they have been accepted as refugees in the us where they will land in houston those who've been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status as they feel from what they've heard that america is amazing making a trip from sudan to america is like making a trip to heaven says the one young man a huge party is thrown for their departure and they are told to do sudan well and once they have been educated to return to sudan so that they can contribute to society they are also warned not to be like those with the baggy pants whom are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men and also no matter what happens not to forget the culture br br you watch as the boys come from a third world country into america and how they attempt to integrate into american society as they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this plentiful world where everything is massively overproduced and they are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities that we take for granted on a daily basis it is humorous at times humbling at others br br listening to the comments they make about black americans and american society culture are quite interesting as the film progresses you see how american culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking br br one of the boys peter is not content with working and making just enough to survive so he up and moves from houston to kansas city so that he can pursue an education when the other boys visit him they talk about how they cannot get into any schools the main reason they came to america was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys have been brought from sudan for an education this is occurring because the boys were given arbitrary ages making them older than they actually are preventing them from being able to enroll in high school br br the film juxtaposes images from houston to kansas we watch as peter enrolls in school where he befriends a group of christian conservative kids and as santiago attempts driving school even though he drives without his license anyways and works at walmart we see peter struggle with high school life as he strives to make his schools basketball team and as santiago has trouble keeping up with work the rent appeasing tensions back home in sudan and most of all coping with loneliness br br it comes to the point where the boys want to return to sudan and tell them that everything they are taught about america there is lies you must make it alone here do everything alone one of the boys says a damning message to a liberal capitalist lifestyle showing how it causes people to become radical a trend which led to the creation of both the neo conservative and radical islamist movements their biggest beef with america though is that there is no time time is money and we don't waste a second br br despite all this the boys never lose their sense of culture they celebrate southern sudan liberation day which marks the day which the began to fight in sudan a fight which continues today they also meet with other lost boys on the anniversary of their arrival in america where they discuss their experience in america as compared to back in sudan when asked one boy says that if he were able to make a living he would much prefer to live in sudan it is much too lonely in america he adds they never lose their sense of community which has been conditioned into them as part of their culture br br this film makes us question the way we live makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies has created within us it will also change the way i look at refugees i will never again take for granted how hard they must work and what immigrants mean for a country such as my own canada this is a wonderful film i laughed i cried a very emotional journey and a very well made documentary 10 out of 10
<START> sure i like some indie films a lot actually i don't always understand them and that's okay not all of them were meant to be understood especially by mainly main stream people like me i'm probably showing my ignorance but i'm still puzzled why 'book of is called that i love those end of world stories and the only thing i could see similar to the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through this i'm not talking about the subject matter perhaps i've been subdued from all the other torture porn i've seen it was just the incredibly slow story one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours major spoilers lie ahead hetero man dancer gets abducted seduced and raped six ways from sunday or in this case 12 days by three hooded women upon his release after his somewhat distraught dancer girlfriend barely flinches other than dropping a glass after wondering which she missed more him or the cigarettes she originally sent him for upon abduction still in a state of reasonable shock he refuses to talk and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing happened and he takes a well needed shower problem as much as he's tormented through the flashbacks to his uh attacks he's as equally aroused granted i haven't been bound and used as a plaything but i doubt i would really be in the mood oh i forgot and how does he try and solve this crime sleep with as many women as he can to try and spot the birthmarks or the criminals had i see where they're going with it Â show a gang rape from the male pov fine twist notwithstanding you could never feel for this guy only saving grace was the good acting of the dancer cancer instructor but even she couldn't save the film
