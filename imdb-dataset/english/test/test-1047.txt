<START> every role down to the smallest has been cast and acted with bravado br br the extraordinary jena malone never takes a misstep her two co stars are equal to her in this film ryan gosling may be the best actor of his generation chris klein gives his best performance to date this is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults you'll think and talk about this film for days highly recommended
<START> anand is one of those low budget but well taken movies it's a cup of coffee entertainment with no violence blood or jump out of your seat excitement which most telugu films have however it does have some of it's own is a headstrong and down to earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation even her offensive mother in law's distaste for her she even backs out of the wedding because her fiancÃ© doesn't stand up for her however her air of confidence and independence is enough to make anand a rich young gentleman living in the city aspire to be her new husband his father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways so why not pay her back but is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior she puts him through a bunch of situations continuing to be rude and a pain it's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too but complications
<START> if you really loved gwtw you will find quite disappointing the story those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett but let me say that considering the novel nothing good could came out of this br br i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs mitchell did for the film it took me some time to understand how good the ending was scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett since she always got what she wanted but there was no kiss in the end br br then alexandra ripley came to fix this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be and of course describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else nothing could have been further from mrs mitchell mind i am sure br br the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending br br if margaret mitchell could came to live again she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw br br sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault isn't it is it any good if i don't compare it to the original maybe sorry to say i don't really care br br i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's suberb work otherwise don't even try
<START> i saw this film at the 2004 toronto international film festival since i work in the wine business i had been quite eager to see this documentary and i wasn't disappointed reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage the good news is that will be releasing not only a theatrical cut but a ten part ten hour series of the film on dvd by next christmas thinkfilm is distributing it the bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast when it was shown in cannes it was close to three hours long for toronto he's cut about half an hour but it still clocked in at 135 minutes now for me that's fine i love wine and i love hearing about the controversies raging in my business but not everyone wants that much br br around the globe from brazil to france to california to italy to argentina talking to wine makers and pr people and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world the theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic robert parker are forcing a kind of on wine small local producers are either being bought up by larger american as well as local or are being pressured by market forces to change their to suit the palate of mr parker who dictates taste to most of the american and world markets br br it's a complicated subject and i can understand why wants to let his subjects talk there is robert patriarch of the napa wine industry and his sons tim and michael whose efforts to buy land in faced opposition from local and government officials there is founder and wine maker of iconoclastic opponent of plans and crusader for that express local terror there is robert parker himself expressing some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the that he favours there is flying wine maker michel consultant for dozens of all over the world advising them how to make parker friendly there are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary br br if you are a wine lover you will want to seek out the ten part series as well as the theatrical version of this film but even if you're not into wine the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions the effects on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored br br 8 10
<START> honestly the only reason i picked up this movie from blockbuster was because aaron carter was in it okay first thing's first do you notice how ugly aaron carter has become i mean he used to be so cute but now with that lanky body and skin ew i think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie could've found a much better looking guy who could lip sync no offense though i thought this teen movie was majorly lame and this is coming from me being a teen myself the girls' in there are oh so predictable the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times especially from aaron and overall i just didn't enjoy it although i give out points for the storyline that was alright but not at all realistic anyway stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time it's not worth the 6 50 br br p s this review of mine may not be applicable to younger kids under the age of 13
<START> i wasn't impressed with the graffiti artist despite it's artsy aka low budget improvisation appeal there is little dialog and at least for me i was disappointed that it didn't give more credit or promote the work of guerrilla artists such as these instead it was a story that covers familiar territory two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends tagging partners and eventually experiment with a relationship they seem like opposites rather uncomfortable together little is explained about their backgrounds and the things between the two young men happen at rapid speed although this i can understand because it's only 70 minutes or so there's been countless numbers of similar plots and productions in recent years to the point that the sphere of independent film is starting to become just as saturated with this particular storytelling just as the mainstream has become saturated with this and more br br much of the film may bore the viewer who needs immediate dialog and purpose the primary figure of this story at least extensively performs his routines with nearly no dialog no insight and nothing else to carry the viewer and for a short film i wished they could've gotten to the point a lot faster that aside from the typical plot annoyed me yet there was something about a momentary glimpse into the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists even if most of it was rather unoccupied time br br recommended if you're tired of the mainstream crap and don't mind an indie picture and have some interested into this underground urban art form but you really have to watch it for yourself because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste for more recent indie films centering on graffiti artists check out transit
<START> beautiful images propaganda and history as toy the ingredients of this film good interesting but with many shadows shadows jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical america he is silhouette of a vision about life and society an extraordinary thinker teacher of large part of north america in film is only superman the delicate contour of ideas are crushed the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten and jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of american realities the end and fake romance and heroic is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom and the war against avatar is another gray stain for one who heard nothing about jefferson movie is a good beginning for the others disillusion it is like the precious silk of a tailor but the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are only ordinary cloth so a sad experience slices of beauty and boring lakes patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation a film who must impressive and the ash of a story who could be magnificent
<START> i enjoyed this for a couple of reasons the emotional tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved but the blend of newsreel footage with the film's narrative was often compelling the other element that i appreciated was the depiction of the werewolves the fanatical nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender i don't know of another film that deals with them they assassinated of aachen on palm sunday 1945 for example and did create problems for the occupation the film then challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities the human issues are presented not so much through the characters here but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived hitler both conquered and victors
<START> a group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending h bomb blast not only do they fear the radiation but also mutants in the surrounding hillside one of the group is already contaminated but strangely poses no real threat to the others just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub plot richard plays the hero mike connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy lori nelson is the girl destined to start a brave new world not one of director roger corman's best this is predictable black and white sci fi
<START> mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you don't want most of it br br first and foremost this whole thing just doesn't make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus load of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him br br however when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burton's dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for Â£50 000 and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut he figures it is better than killing him br br a wealth of things arise here which just don't add up 1 why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing 2 not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke 3 hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way 4 rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why aren't the cops checking the place out 5 rourke hangs around the church and blind niece in particular for days afterwards without anybody bothering him what he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid 6 the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they don't even check up on him 7 why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other 8 why does bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous 9 rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days 10 the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view 11 things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates' houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl 12 rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked 13 priest is an ex army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalled for and yet another cringe worthy scene br br i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourke's hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style br br i have just mentioned them br br overall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director br br 4 10
<START> james cagney plays richard gargan nicknamed patsy a former gangster now overseeing the surly lads as the new superintendent of a state run reform school tepid genre entry wherein cagney's the whole show he dominates the picture but only because there's not much else of interest going on jimmy gives just what's expected from his hard boiled persona which can be satisfying if you're in for a quick fix the direction by archie mayo though michael curtiz was said to have helped is straightforward without being particularly gripping although the narrative slips in the second half grinding the film down to a messy conclusion with even cagney's patsy getting lost in the shuffle remade in 1938 as crime school and again in 1939 as hell's kitchen from
<START> hm where do i start i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance but this time i wish i'd paid attention br br i know some people liked it and i'm not trying to say that they shouldn't it was semi amusing at some parts but if you're like me and you don't like watching cats prancing around in the for 20 minutes random fast motion cloud scenes dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to music and close ups of faces while people are speaking then you might want to avoid this movie the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top and the film quality was awful fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on but well she doesn't really convince me otherwise in fact i ended up really disliking her crazy character and what was up with the souls in space i understand this is a fantasy movie but come on br br i will say the angel at the end was freaking creepy it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie way more creepy than the darth maul lava face demon i give them props for that scene it was good but not good enough to actually see the movie and the opening credits were great but don't be fooled i would've rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better br br bah i wish i hadn't bought this for even the 2 that i paid for it i could have bought a candy bar instead
<START> the animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode simpsons roasting on an open fire but already with this first regular episode bart the genius the humor is beginning to be more layered quicker and greater depth of characterization is already appearing br br this episode firmly establishes bart's slacker personality and more subtly lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family although that's the main theme of the whole episode there's also a nice secondary theme of bart and homer's father son relationship it's given to us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with the simpsons playing scrabble lisa comes up with id for her word short but something you have to be well educated to know she has to read the definition to the rest of the family from the dictionary which has been serving as a way to prop up the couch marge can only come up with he homer has already sitting on his tray in order but doesn't recognize that it's a word so he presents do instead bart comes up with which he insists is a word similarly in the main plot line of the episode bart cheats on his iq test which leads to his being put into a special school full of gifted kids we know that's not likely to last long br br the simpsons has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through its characters and more importantly they way that people with vary degrees of intellectual abilities fit into or not are accepted or not and are perceived in society aside from beginning to present bart lisa homer and marge's place in this context this episode already starts respectfully poking fun at nerds and geeks outside of the simpsons family via some of the dialogue from the students at the special school as well as some of the other references including purely visual ones this episode also shows that the simpsons isn't going to pull any punches by means of writing or talking down to its audience it may be just a cartoon but it's a cartoon that intellectuals geeks and nerds are going to understand more than anyone else and that fact aside from it just being a very funny show is the key to the show's longevity
<START> peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor the lovely susannah york provides a good foil for o'toole's dramatic presence br br the film alludes to incest without a single explicit scene but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary though this is not major film by any reckoning it will be remembered for its entertaining performances br br even york signing the papers at the end is a treat to watch exuding tragedy silently the possible weakness here is thompson's laid back direction but the film floats because of the actors and the script br br i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years on both occasions with the name brotherly love country dance is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie wherever it was released as such
<START> deep sea 3d is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand br br from the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily us in the ocean the filmmakers make full use of the imax format a jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre a shark powers towards us predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey it is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes br br our ears on the other hand are not given the same treatment the film is narrated by hollywood stars jonny depp and kate winslet both sound so ridiculous it positively spoils the enjoyment of the visuals depp sounds slightly bored whilst winslet sounds as if she is reading a bedtime story to the village idiot i was shocked that an actress of her status could have pitched her performance so wrongly the script is fairly silly and contains very little depth the soundtrack is filled with strange unrealistic sound effects which i assume are meant to be funny but in fact detract attention from the material which should have been allowed to speak for itself br br danny elfman has provided an excellent score which gives plenty of impact to the ups and downs of life under the sea when it is allowed to play out without the silly bubble sounds or which pepper film br br the film is a technical marvel but with it's childish script annoying narration and misplaced sound effects it cannot be taken seriously
