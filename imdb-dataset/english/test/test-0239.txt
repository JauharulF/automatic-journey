<START> one your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours these do nothing for the story but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about yeah right br br two these guys being like real professional pros they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk look grissom these are what we call fingerprints everybody has them and they are different on each person so with these fingerprints we can actually find br br yup exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around br br however not everything about this show is bad some stories work to some degree and the colours are really beautiful they use red blue green yellow all of them colours i've loved since kindergarten
<START> a warmly sentimental tale from the author of the waltons were someone to pitch the material to me i would probably reject it as too maudlin but the dramatization here manages a tear without the expected embarrassment no one in the 1950's was better at lovable hayseeds than arthur hunnicutt his appeal here is put to consummate use as a mountain man doggedly faithful to a loyal hunting hound their fates are tied together as as any human bond good i see a subtle environmental message here all critters go to heaven because how can we condemn any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive there is no deceit in the kingdom of animals and yet how cruelly we often treat them an oddly satisfying episode that confirms this important message
<START> any horror film that casts robert englund freddie kruger then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits have even run should be instantly viewed with nothing but suspicion br br tony todd candyman as a swamp tour guide his james earl jones voice impression is hysterical by the way i don't know or care if he was trying to be funny but i was laughing at it sadly his role was all of 5 minutes long as well more reasons for suspicion and quite rightly so br br mercedes mcnab aka harmony from buffy angel i had to look her up to see what i remembered her from but she gets semi naked marcus the token black guy not another teen movie is filling a comedy role that really isn't required in a horror movie unless it's intended as a spoof br br joel murray bill murray's brother pete from dharma greg plays shapiro the guy shooting the gonzo video with the 2 cute girls as they take a spooky swap ghost tour the 2 lead male characters meet up with some other folks and get run on rocks and have to leave the boat so their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain br br once the real story of victor crowley has been told his make up looked like sloth from the goonies we have established he is dead well you aren't coming back from being hit in the skull by an axe once the old guy is attacked despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot it takes marybeth more than 30 seconds to actually start firing at a guy who is hacking an old man apart with a hatchet is she stupid thats 29 second too long in terms of plot there really isn't one i don't class undead psycho as a plot sorry and the pacing is really bad as well you have a killing some running away some light relief then some slow dialogue before beginning the cycle again br br after an extremely long scene investigating a wobbly bush with a raccoon in it victor appears again with some sort of power tool and kills the dark haired porno girl he also manages to slice the tour guide in half with a shovel once misty is left on her own to keep lookout for ben i felt it was pretty obvious she was going to be the next to die i was right but you don't get to see it br br film makers rain will not burning gasoline ok idiots obviously after the 2 near misses in the cemetery marcus was next to die and ben was hurt in the foot with the spike but they managed to find a boat after impaling victor on the spike br br she's pulled into the water by something unseen he's trying to save her then she's suddenly pulled into the boat by victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly ends br br yeah just like that no clue if ben was dead he seemed to be missing an arm and no clue if marybeth was going to survive and what happened with victor br br it's an awful ending and no doubt my verbal attack at the film makers got the last review deleted so much for free speech eh
<START> 'this life' is truly as bad as it gets its cast of mercenary lascivious ruthless duplicitous shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post eighties setting and i have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation unfortunately it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and i regard it as just another step toward the television premium rate phone in scams astonishingly bad cheap reality and 'celebrity' saturated television and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and indeed much of british society sounds exaggerated i don't think it is in this regard programs such as 'this life' have indeed been as influential as they are often called
<START> there are shows and films i've seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdb com that i've disagreed with and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion br br reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to browse the internet posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible for br br how else would one explain a review that this show is sure to become a phenomenon a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort br br i won't waste words describing this mess but suffice to say if you enjoy wives who emasculate their husbands husbands who emasculate their sons children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to characters that are basically just unfunny one liner spewing automatons then watch this show br br i on the other hand have some seinfeld dvds to get through br br futurama cancelled titus cancelled arrested development cancelled the war at home renewed br br no justice
<START> maybe my rating should have been a 9 but the film absolutely stunned me when viewing it first time and my latest viewing confirmed my initial belief stylish yes every scene has crafted scoped views terrific angles with a perfect sound side accompanying them br br put on top great acting from especially toni garner it with one of the most beautiful and charming women in olivia magnani and a fine plot and you will end up seeing this small masterpiece over and over br br paulo next movie de which is in competition in this years cannes festival will be eagerly awaited
<START> i first saw this as a kid the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born and fairly recently bought this on dvd in between i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 the pie fight itself and 2 how racist some of these parts were farina as a slave doing voodoo for example i think roach and would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now br br notice how the pie fights in the three stooges' holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this one and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel hardy's the battle of the century for these films remember at that time they all stole from the best each other br br one more note laurel hardy buffs that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn who also appeared in the getting into her car and getting it in the rear end it always escapes me why she was never credited
<START> i love b movies but i like to be aware from the beginning that i'm watching one i can't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad br br aliens and predator are awesome this movie made a big joke out of them the creators didn't take this movie seriously at all i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film they made a mockery of amazing characters it's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning then their writers got high and gave up almost nothing was continuous the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves
<START> conrad phillips stars in the 1950s action adventure series william tell set in the century during the hostile austrian occupation of switzerland william tell is a reluctant freedom fighter battling heroically against the tyranny and oppression of the invading forces william tell is the swiss version of robin hood conrad phillips plays the protagonist fantastically it is possible that pascal would have had greater success in the role but he was unavailable at the time of filming the classic action show is made up of series of 39 the episodes are in black and white but this does not detract from the entertainment in any way
<START> fbi agents mulder and scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team in this early 'x files' episode that david duchovny himself considers one of their first rockin' episodes it pays loving homage to the much lauded john carpenter 1982 theatrical feature the thing and one can see the similarities visually color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality production design art direction are especially impressive the shots of the exterior of the arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers naturally our heroes are threatened by the weather so the sound design involving wind evokes memories of the thing br br the culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team once inside a host it stimulates aggressive behavior this allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold and the way the script is set up we can't be too sure of who's infected and who's not this gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing this episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups it even allows mulder and scully to have moments where they're not sure if they can trust each other br br guest starring are a good small group of actors xander berkeley felicity huffman and steve hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany mulder and scully on the mission and jeff kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp you can also see one time jason voorhees portrayer ken as one of the ill fated original team members br br incidentally there's one direct link between and the thing art director murray who worked on both projects br br 8 10
<START> initially i was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the dvd in fact this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image s it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me or to my friends but i rented and watched it and was truly amazed br br i agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual so it is definitely not something i'd want young children to watch and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway br br i enjoy movies like this whereby the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no nonsense direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad the acting done was it acting ricci and jackson performed so well i was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting same thing with the story may seem far fetched somewhat but it was done so very very well it reminded me of another movie with mel gibson tim where each character had limitations whether mental or circumstantial so were well defined br br i found much depth in this movie with the character's involved so feel that everyone involved from the cameramen to the actors should be commended on a perfect fit result after viewing this movie i had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like i did so after hearing my comments they rented and watched it they too were quite surprised at how good it was it is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off i can see now how the art applies but i'd not heard of this movie before and the art was my first impression art sells or destroys dvd sales rentals br br these characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the feel for each i felt i could trust the movie to flow well and it did so with the jacket art aside i would recommend watching this movie
<START> this is my favorite renoir from the fifties it's the story of how henri built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described br br gabin is in great form as the easy going see him deal humorously with violent boyfriend gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting maria felix with that amazon's body is imposing as the egotistical lola first lover finally franÃ§oise as the washing girl who ends up dancing for and becoming his girl is just stunning her loveliness and pert charm will win you over br br a bonus we get edith piaf andrÃ© and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge
<START> first off the alien saves a little black boy as well as a mexican despite what the imdb plot summary suggests this film is the fulfillment of the purest of male interracial rape the main character in this film is a george dope who doesn't understand primal human urges like drug abuse and murder in fact every time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him what a square in any case my favorite scene is when he writes the gang members a letter stating if they want the 500 bucks they get from the reading center for protection they must meet with him at the meeting he is surrounded by countless gangsters but he keeps a cool head in slow motion he punches the wooden post of a stop sign that shatters upon contact then still in slow motion points at the leader of the gang and says noooooooooooooooooooo the gang members comply cool right the beauty of this film shows through in these simple solutions to social problems like prostitution and gang violence
<START> forget all those sappy romantic movies involving notebooks and lip locked couples who somehow manage to go to the great beyond together after a screen lifetime of over simplified unrealistic romance forget all those shameless dog gives its life to save its family flicks although i have to admit that i have a soft spot for them myself forget ricky schroeder already displaying his propensity to overact at a tender age now that one was shameless br br this tv movie which unfortunately never seems to get aired anymore is the all time champion of tear jerkers hands down and a well written and well acted story to boot ann margret took a big chance in taking this role nothing flamboyant or sexy about her here and that's a monumental achievement in itself based on a true story she plays lucile fray a terminally ill mother who chooses to struggle till her dying breath to find good homes for her ten children instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies frederic forrest does a great job as her husband the good hearted but unreliable breadwinner whose crippling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for the kids br br the film takes us through heart wrenching process of interviewing prospective parents and then watching her kids leave home it also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and of the father grieving over the tragedy taking place now and the one sure to follow and frustrated over his inability to do more the scene in which the youngest of the children steven is taken to his new home is the most heart breaking i've ever watched now i grew up as a hopeless romantic and have spent the many years since then growing myself a harder more cynical shell i usually find more to mock than to empathize with in the sentimental cinematic tripe foisted upon us these days but this gem from the early 1980's still slays me br br i really wish that someone with a lick of marketing sense would release a dvd version of this drama among the special features one needs to include the emmy awards telecast the following year a m was nominated for this role but the award for best dramatic actress went to barbara stanwyck for thorn birds in what has to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a truly drab awards show stanwyck broke into tears during her acceptance speech and gushed out ann margret i love you which brought ann m to tears br br one final note the imdb rating for who will love my children is 6 4 as of this writing however over 75 of the ratings are in the 8 10 range mostly 10's whatever kind of system this site uses to modify the overall ratings of the movies listed by imdb it completely misses the mark on this one this one is the weeper of all time and a darn good tv movie to boot
<START> here's a well made war story nicely shot and well acted the portraying of the italian and german occupancy of greek island is well done john hurt as father and the island doctor is superb nicolas cage does a good job as the captain from the title penelope cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at cage there's heroics and humor there's drama and romance and it is all set on an idyllic island br br oddly enough a very similar or should i say almost identical storyline with the same characters going through the same series of events is told in a novel by the same title written by louis de this wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful daughter of doctor and their life on during wwii fiancee local fisherman enlists when the italian army invades northern greece from albania under false pretenses when the axis finally prevails with a lot of help from the germans a garrison of italian soldiers is stationed on the island and captain plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time as joins the partisans charming and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter of course this makes it a novel about love but it is also a war novel a summary of greek history a tale of communist uprising in post war greece a portrait of the madness of mussolini and most importantly an ode to island life on br br some of these elements return in the movie but in general it is an impossible book to film i am glad nobody ever tried br br the movie 'captain however is worth seeing just make sure you read the book after you see the movie
