<START> i bought this film at blockbuster for 3 00 because it sounded interesting a bit ranma esque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong br br having watched it i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i don't usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort even the anti religious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightest it would be better just to listen to ray stevens' would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg 13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this as if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba is worse br br it is but not in that way br br in a way this worries me the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides it's teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story i've been writing into a pg 13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think it's number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it br br just say no to this movie though 2 10
<START> if you think about it it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty one of the world's most controversial topics that offends neither those for nor against it's a testament to tim robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well shawshank redemption jacob's ladder br br this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the for and against camps so subtle that it can't be put into words subtle to the point of vanishing yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough
<START> i saw this ego centric effort at achieving a film of epic status in the company of several native russian family members five people gave 5 different reactions from worship to my cynicism br br i saw a movie that looked like took a lot of canal money put some of it in his and other's pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students i counted at least 4 different styles in the movie there is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes contrast these for yourself br br polishing shoes with a dog br br station scene saying goodbye to andrei br br panorama shots br br talking through the keyhole br br attempt on the grand duke and later chase scenes to get andrei back to sing in figaro br br sequence br br julia ormond is faster than superman learning about his transfer belatedly she gets all the way across moscow in one minute to say goodbye to andrei br br the russian natives felt that the impression given of russian life was caricature and not history they called it tourist postcard russia br br they were all proud that a russian director producer fixer has managed to break into the big time and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming br br if you want to think you have seen russia go see this movie drink some coffee before you go
<START> in one sense i kind of liked this movie because of a 'mindless' positive atmosphere it sort of conveys i had a problem with an aspect of the plot but more about that later first the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional the 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits hmmm the basic storyline was ok pretty simple and standard nothing too exciting or objectionable the main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs kind of a nice fantasy element to have however they had a very minimal presence in the movie br br outside of that the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too bogged down in any one place i liked this about the movie br br the problem i had with the plot had to do with the the idea of stealing i think this movie may not have been thought out enough something's wrong especially if this is a kid's movie i'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler skip it if you're worried the 'good guys' do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie br br overall if you have kids because of a questionable plot aspect i'd consider passing however this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter pass this one if you have any other interesting choices
<START> am i the only person who saw and remembers amadeus every scene in copying has its counterpart in the milos forman amadeus from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings to the entrance of anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at beethoven's feet a la before the dying mozart does no one else recall the dialog in that script br br time mozart common time we begin with the strings and so it copies br br remember cynthia nixon leaning against a door tears falling down her freckled face same scene just replace her with beethoven's nephew even the scatological humor fart jokes are the same we even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls in the banquet hall does no one else remember br br and the scene where anna cries to god why did you give me this gift said the same thing br br and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character you'd find in a children's story i am mr beethoven i am the composer br br and what after all is the purpose of the bridge builder other than to juxtapose the technical against the artistic a comparison that is not at all developed probably because it has no meaning especially when it comes to who was a master of the technical br br there's only one great scene the playing of the ninth first the music which of itself takes you to tears but then there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the copyist keeping time and beethoven conducting which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy so intense it's almost embarrassing br br but please the rest of the film where is the world's collective memory you have seen this all before and better
<START> this film is without a doubt the worst action film i have ever seen i am sorry but it is just pathetic in fact the best part of the movie this movie is supposed to be a serious one is when a chicken speeds across the road on foot at about 100 miles per hour this pathetic editing mistake makes the film absolutely hilarious for approximately 2 seconds then it is back to non stop on the edge of your seat as you try to find a comfortable position to sleep in action
<START> faith akin has made me realize once more the deepness of my passion for this city called istanbul being addressed as a city of cultural mosaics faith akin has contributed to that addressing through the mosaics of music performed in the film what's more the climax of the film in my opinion is the scene where a turkish music diva sings at age 86 as well as she had done in her younger years and rolls the glass in the air without pouring out one drop which is a traditional act in culture she is just marvellous a turkish pop singer with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song which gives the film its turkish title makes the scene no less than a climax last but not least the wonderful scenery of istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are away beware
<START> i cannot believe i was hooked on this show instantly after seeing the first scene i was in it deep br br anyway first of all the guys are hot cappy evan calvin fischer cappy heath cappy etc br br secondly the girls are cute sexy smart and are not afraid of being called bitches i like that which at the same time doesn't make them mean and greedy just realistic br br third the relationships are so great especially casey and cappy lately every show turns very away from it's original path and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season cappy and casey's relationship is true love a kind that lasts they loved each other throughout the years and it didn't end when a guest star appeared br br in todays world maybe it's kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens and people define each other in college so i knew exactly who i wanted to be with in college just like casey and cappy br br i hope there are many more seasons of this show and i hope we can see the relationship between casey and cappy now that they will probably stay together at thanksgiving love this show
<START> i just saw this on tcm tonight and was shocked at the over acting by jean arthur her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over doing everything was not in the same style as dietrich and art lund dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing she being the best thing in this movie the wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to get away w being wicked witty and dirty but just sounded boring and not funny at all it seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny the ending was totally contrived br br spoiler ahead never for a moment did i believe that art lund suddenly fell outta love w dietrich and then was suddenly madly in love w arthur oh billy get real 3 out of 10
<START> did i waste my time this is very pretentious film in the beginning you will think there's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people br br unbelievably boring pointless film stay away so many good soundtracks i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film stay away 1 on 10
<START> why was this film made what were the creators of this thinking the first 8mm film at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting the first film was about the snuff film industry this sequel is about hold on the porno industry yes as if the snuff film industry an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment were at all in the same league with the adult film industry an industry in which people film other people engaging in sex acts and situations for eroticism the idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea for this film alone is it isn't helped by a lack of plot character acting direction script logic theme or even sound design this is a remarkably boring film that never once held my attention literally nothing works why would a mystery thriller film about the porno industry involving assassination and betrayal work anyway i don't have much of an interest in adult films but i certainly have watched them before why would somebody make a film about the evils of it and that they would make it in a sequel to a film about snuff movies i don't even know if there is an industry involved in snuff film making but i hope it doesn't the idea of a snuff film alone is horrific and only people who are truly sick and bad would be a part of it i don't think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture i'm pretty sure that a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than to hurt and kill people it is never okay to hurt another human being the adult film industry isn't about hurting people it's about creating films that are to me a diversion and a waste of time what is this film trying to say it doesn't work
<START> a powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the burmese people against their tyrants i felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there something like compassion and admiration at the same time together with a bit of rage because i feel that no one neither the countries of the world nor themselves is doing anything effective to end this shame i think these feelings became directly from the movie and that they were intended when it was made so it is a successful movie the desire for peace the quest for enlightenment the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation in fact it is the buddhist burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators but how can you feel angry about these poor people
<START> george original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema's most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time shamelessly stolen by tarantino for kill bill volume two but it has plenty more to offer than that playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichÃ©s of standard 'lady plots it also offers superb characterisation and strong underplayed but convincing performances br br unfortunately i can only assume that when it came to the remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered from this disastrous misstep br br chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from tah e ville no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they don't even look good Â keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they're given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the high low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending Â standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 'let's end on a joke like a tv cop show' moment Â best not go thereÂ which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score can't do anything for this one
<START> this movie is a great movie only if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it as a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields it is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the earth's surface it also is funny how active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6 5 magnitude earthquake they seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage also it is funny how much they make the coast line of washington state and also oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of southern california the jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong the director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2
<START> in this film we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with what was the point of making the film then to show that it would have been better not to have had in cold blood a book i admire incidentally in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact hardly he behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book so his degradation is a matter of degree are we supposed to care enough about capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer perry smith are kindred spirits with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none mr capote's plight didn't touch me at all i'm afraid so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me but even if i could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect while keener and cooper are so warm and interesting that i was yearning for more of them dreary beyond belief
