<START> the movie opens with charlie jeff daniels a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli it appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check instead of reaching for his plastic he glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying unbeknownst to charlie lulu melanie griffith had been observing him from the other side of the deli br br lulu is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page boy cut she follows him out to let him know that she saw what he did he tries to deny it but can't escape her accusation thinking he's in it charlie is surprised when lulu says she doesn't work for the deli and then offers him a ride back to work br br when she heads in the opposite direction thus begins their cavorting across the middle atlantic seaboard br br we're supposed to get titillated as thoroughly modern lulu puts straight laced charlie into humiliating situations it's all right when the two consenting adults get a little kinky in a motel room but off putting when they out of paying the check at a family style restaurant stealing the labor from hard working people is not my idea of wild charlie is a jerk br br lulu is a loony jerk she starts to pass off charlie as her husband first to her mom who blithely tolerates the charade and then at her conveniently timed 10 year high school reunion an event used later by another too cool for its own good movie grosse pointe blank br br the marriage comes as a surprise to lulu 's real husband ray liotta who's just been recently released from prison for armed robbery ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is br br i can't add any irony by writing that i first watched this by sneaking in the movie theater no i don't do that sort of thing i taped it off of cable tv and assure you i view it strictly in the privacy of my own home br br so i got to thinking why i taped it when i don't like it very much and conclude that 20 years ago i was on a reggae kick and the soundtrack of something wild does prominently feature reggae the closing credits start with the treat of sister carol performing her version of wild thing
<START> what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it i bought it because god help me i'm a sucker for old b cinema even as worthless as this nonetheless something about this movie irritates me it's probably janet janet comes off cold snooty seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with a look on her face that screams constipation she can't seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants i'm glad that this is her only role what really irritates me is that this is a 1960's gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is floridian for zero gore it's like the director started with a herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing in other words we end up with florida bore joseph adler should be embarrassed boyfriend jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it he's probably the least likable good guy in horror history the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60's early 70's b gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker his pals blood freak or most anything from herschell lewis even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this i ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect in the only real ironic twist scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this why does troma distribute this wouldn't this be something weird video's area scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror gore of its era but i suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential scream baby scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern so to steal a quote from janet if it doesn't fit i throw it out 2 10
<START> this movie brings to mind boys 'n the hood menace to society south central and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them the film's us vs the law mentality is underscored by the all black neighborhood vs the nearly all white police force here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they've just liberated from its owner it's like a bushwhacking from an old western but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real br br the story centers on young jason petty and his buddies to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their real occupation of boosting cars this happens to be newark n j a rust belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime in fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have car theft written on their backs to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime br br the boys use a slim jim to gleefully break into cars and go joy riding as if it's no big deal they only run into real trouble when the police ambush them the vicious nazi like lt has a vendetta against the boys seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption but as human targets in fact he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic nazi officer of the warsaw ghetto who shot down jews for pleasure in the film schindler's list when the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush things predictably go downhill fast they are severely beaten by the cops and jason finally ends up in prison clearly these are bad boys who'd steal your car in a minute but the film wants us to see them as anti heroes showing jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother the film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for the boys whose lives are going down the drain the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of newark itself the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal soul dead cops br br in spite of the over the top portrayal of the latter the film offers a realistic looking rendering of the ghetto of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths law enforcement and crime strangely the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned br br the filmmakers including producer spike lee are obviously biased against the newark police who we hope are not as bad they are portrayed here nevertheless they've given us yet another a strong affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and sharron corley is fine as jason
<START> i found this movie at a xxx store for 1 on vhs the interesting thing about it is that camp video bought up the rights to it and slapped on a 1986 copywrite date in the credits anyways enough of odd facts br br this film is absolutely not scary to even call this horror or a thriller is laughable there were only maybe 5 minutes at most of what you would call horror in this 80 minute film and that consisted of the acting because it was horrorible all puns aside the writing for this film was absolute garbage as well just as the special effects and makeup was laughable no wonder this is such an obscure film probably the director has spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in one big pile so no one else could be subjected to it
<START> i like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what i had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year however i was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled but to be fair there were redeemable qualities although very few let's start with what worked first the on point in every way Â from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity the action sublimely visceral Â when it did occur nighy victor and sheen lucian perfect now what did not and there is plenty this was less a movie and more a collage of sequences and do not expect to see any supporting characters from the other movies except and profoundly missing was a well written storyline and anything of real substance to bring these pieces of film together the story seemed to start right in the middle Â at the cusp where lucian had made up his mind to rebel therefore there was no context no tension no sense of betrayal Â the devices needed to make everything else work moreover it ended at where the climax should have begun which needed to be after the feud had simmered for a bit oh and it was way too short purist will also find offense in some liberties taken to certain facts previously revealed in the first two judge that for yourself in the end this movie lingered to long on what should have been brief background scenes e g various council scenes and as a consequence we never really got to know or care about the principal players or the movie ouch d
<START> i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical irishman lovely to read br br however a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice br br envy greed pride sloth anger etc and justice in the forms of blind and divine br br i could demonstrate three examples of each one for each of the three protagonists however it is much more fun to note them for oneself br br this is an excellent film br br don't miss it
<START> as long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than you normally might for other films this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see the film portrays an incident that might occur in real life nothing in it seems fictional at all in fact it also portrays how people might react in real life br br in fact it portrays these so well that is seems like real life combine that with the lack of a soundtrack and you've almost got the best news like movie you've ever seen jane fonda and jack lemmon are particularly good in this late seventies masterpiece evoking concern on her end and genuine tragic pity on his end i highly recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers
<START> each year the company called nu produces couple of action packed full of suspense movies this little nugget called iii until i visited this site i wasn't this is a whole trilogy is a great example of the good job the company is doing frank is as mean as always and does a great job as almost schizophrenic android i won't waste any more words since i don't want to reveal the terrific plot and ruin you a couple of great laughs br br rating 2 10 for those hard working man putting together this kind of rubbish must be
<START> one of the most charming and for me at least the most powerful elements of anthony enthralling best picture winner the english patient is that in the mid 90s when hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects a film was created that brought back powerful the sweeping wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as lawrence of arabia 1962 and the ten commandments 1956 the english patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful it has that glorious feeling a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all and fascinating characters with pasts and stories br br the english patient based on a novel by the same name by michael is like the godfather part ii 1974 in the sense of how it's constructed it's a blending of two stories the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character an english patient in the post years of world war two ralph fiennes plays the english patient who has been scarred for life by a plane crash and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by juliette binoche apart from bonding with her raspy voiced troubled patient binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger willem dafoe arrives and the two men appear to know each other br br that's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film the other one told in flashback is the patient's past before he was scarred and dying in a bed the story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever br br to be blunt the english patient is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently what i really admired about the love story between ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was how passionate how obsessive how enchanting it was shown on screen usually in love stories such as later cold mountain 2003 the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love but still because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion we can believe that there is a sure true love between these characters it reminded me a lot of vertigo 1958 in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other br br performances all around were great i was especially enthralled by the performance by juliette binoche who took home the oscar for her performance the following year i also liked willem dafoe playing the sort of cynical questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing and of course i can't leave out fiennes and scott thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers br br despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic i would be dishonest if i were to describe it as a perfect film there are two flaws that i cannot glance over number one it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint there are a few unnecessary subplots i was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between binoche and a bomb specialist played by andrews my research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and i'm sure it worked perfectly in there but in the film it just seems a and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me i was far more interested by fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses br br nevertheless these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit those put aside the english patient is an extraordinary achievement of film making to me it was sort of like an insane mix up between casablanca 1942 and lawrence of arabia 1962 two remarkable and better films and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time it is a real shame that anthony has left us for he was a truly gifted filmmaker this is all the evidence anybody needs
<START> irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories let alone all three everything seems to fit together so precisely all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts trois is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements simply brilliant
<START> i finally saw this on video after years of hearing about it it is by no means a perfect movie but it is oddly hypnotic one of those rare special films that creates its own world br br spoilers first the bad stuff the scenes in class are excruciating even if the subject is social studies this guy is way over the top his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable and no teachers i ever had would grill their students like that and tell the ones who protest to shut up these scenes are brief but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story next how the heck does just walk out of the police station near the end also what happened to samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town he spends the rest of the film being around by or end spoilers br br ahhh this guy is great dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie in the mail i love company you're my friend every line is a classic he gives an internal logic that makes the story work incredibly he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy especially when samson talks about his samson's future br br by contrast crispin glover is hard to take sometimes yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect kids with cars in high school always have something to do and buds to do it with matt's low key attitude makes a good foil for their friendship is believable glover's mannerisms are a little much but he is consistent throughout he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does just try to imagine this flick if were as much of a zombie as matt or samson snoozefest br br spoilers what makes river's edge unsettling is the fact that samson is not really evil in the usual sense he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted in other words he is like thousands of other boring guys after he kills jamie he starts to unravel which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again end spoilers br br part of this movie's appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view the parents are comic relief mom tony's dad or overwhelmed matt's mom this underlines how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is river's edge is a textbook on alienation it conveys how awkward mysterious and disconcerting adolescence is like no other film
<START> barney is just awful as many of the other reviews on this show say i'm not one to disagree with them i won't because i hate this show just as much as they do they use kids that look like they're in sixth grade cheesy plots horrid dialog and really crappy special effects not to mention that big purple dinosaur himself he makes every other kid show look like award winners sesame street has won awards that i know about br br please just watch sesame street thomas the tank engine or even the teletubbies avoid both this and its movie which i also reviewed they are both extremely crappy and are inappropriate to anyone even little babies
<START> putting aside the i'm so sure s and totally gnarly s this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romances portrayed on film deborah foreman where is she now as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeo and juliet tony and maria jake and samantha you can't help but fall in love with them plus the soundtrack the sparks the furs the flirts and of course modern english is also outstanding for fans of films about young love i'd equally recommend the recent film all the real girls by david gordon green
<START> this film has a really weird mixture of genres toilet humour and action in one it doesn't really pull it off it should have stuck to one genre the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute br br the most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when moses sandler and carter wayans decide to stop off at a hunting lodge motel i'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is it just seems gratuitous in the extreme the proprietor of the hunting lodge charlie is a very nerdy looking guy for some reason moses starts a conversation with charlie about porno jacking off homosexual sex sex in a threesome charlie's photo of his wife appears to be charlie dressed in drag there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene anyway the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked moses ends up with carter's gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window it all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality horrified and titillated all at the same time which i don't find funny at all br br i have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies this is the first one i've seen after this i'm not sure i want to see any more br br btw this is my husband's account he's seen happy gilmore and he tells me it's quite good maybe i should give sandler just one more chance br br countess
<START> sometime ago i watched a video of paul thomas anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape paul thomas anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by burt reynolds his name is jack horner a director whose biggest dream is to make a real film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and at the same time exciting with the and with the big cocks and tits soon as he meets eddie adams mark he believes that he has found the new star for his films and that's how the story of the young eddie in the porn industry begins br br the film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry living their daily routine but soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party the story of the new eddie begins the story of dirk diggler all of them will taste the real success with dirk as the main star winning lots of prizes and helping jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about brock landers the new character of dirk this sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for jack are his firsts real films but here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the horrible 80's when there is going to be ex drugs and rock roll for dirk and pals but we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses in decadence after trying and failing in the music industry there's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for dirk and his friends that sequence is the one of his first drug deal with the appearance of alfred molina which ends in a total mess is funny for us and a terrible experience for dirk and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when dirk is back brock is back br br well i haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but i must say that all are amazingly well developed the cast is just superb with the best performance that i have seen of mark julianne moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character reilly macy hoffman heather graham guzman etc are just memorable all of their characters with funny and sad moments br br finally i really love the amazing cinematic style of anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's i used to say that magnolia was my favourite of anderson but right now after watching all except sidney i can't say that i have a favourite because i love them all br br ps somewhere i read that this film is the scorsese film of anderson so i'm more than sure that if you love goodfellas and casino you will love this one too i f cking love boogie nights
