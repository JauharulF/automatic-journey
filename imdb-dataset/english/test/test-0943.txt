<START> the last dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting it succeeds at doing both br br is a big game hunter who hunts big game go figure owning a company he is planning on going on an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named frankie a japanese scientist a guy who works for his company named chuck and an african guy who has aided him on many named bun ta the point is to study what is believed to be tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area they will be getting to this prehistoric area taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called the polar after getting to the area they soon find the tyrannosaurus which tries to shoot but his gun gets jammed chuck immediately senses that wanted to hunt the dinosaur all along to add it to his collection of stuffed animals while they were away tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the polar away from their camp upon returning the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected and states that he will kill the tyrannosaurus br br the story is great for a science fiction film drilling to a prehistoric area is something that seems could really happen the scenery is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside br br also i liked the characters in this film is the typical big time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy kill also great was bun ta played by luther formerly of the nba who really looks and acts like an african tracker jackie is the typical female who causes problems for the group and seems to not belong in the wilderness chuck is the former employee of who has his view of his boss change when he is in the wild with him br br the tyrannosaurus in this film is one of the best in a film it stands a little too up right like godzilla does and it drags its tail so it is a guy in a suit but the suit looks good especially the head and the tail and the tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary i have seen plenty of other films where dinosaur suits look way worse tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes emits a roar sounding like godzilla's and other times roars like king kong from king kong escapes and king kong vs godzilla so a great tyrannosaurus br br there is plenty of action in the last dinosaur of particular note is a great fight between tyrannosaurus and triceratops also a great scene where bun ta tries to spear the tyrannosaurus there are other great parts that i wont give away you have to see for yourself br br i recommend this film to everyone watch it and you will not be disappointed
<START> i saw this movie on a night i couldn't sleep i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again probably the best movie i have ever seen at the time and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of nyc this is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing pleasure because you see it hear it and feel it from the moment i saw drinking a beer and watching the game i imagined what it must be like to grow up without a father there are so many lines from this movie i use on a daily basis like the personal alone time in the bathroom drinking a 7 11 beverage great film
<START> i watched this after seeing death tunnel this being without question the worst movie i've ever seen in my life so you can understand i went in rolling my eyes a little at seeing the directors and producers of that cinematic gem being in charge of this one first of all i thought the director and producer were the same guy they both are kid rock meets dawg the bounty hunter i watched the taps investigation and i am not a skeptic i think taps is the closest one will ever get to a scientific method in the field that was cool and believable i do believe they are haunted br br but this like the reviewer above mentioned like taking a tour okay a tour fine but the investigators and group leaders seemed to make a pretty penny and have a financial investment into whether its haunted or not so when they have fantabulous stories i have to take it with a heaping of salt br br as someone else mentioned i could make out whatever they wanted me to see in the picture about 50 of the time the rest of the time i couldn't make out anything also without any context to the photos time of day type of camera moisture in the room dust particles which 75 are what the orbs are weather and a ga other factors i cant accept them i also cant help thinking that some might be doctored br br why would that band keep the numbers from the door vandalism also during the taps investigation they tried to dig up the death certificates of those nurses and they only found one which was ruled accidental people didn't want to officially proclaim suicide yet when one of the guides was mentioning this he said yep and its marked suicide it really felt like the guides to the haunted houses here in october br br i did however like the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospital s that really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch i'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions and weren't some ghoulish wardens they weren't the best methods but its all they had they were desperate to stop the disease
<START> i remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74 75 my dad took me my brother sister to cinema in england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it
<START> i really enjoyed this both times i watched it and both times i walked away thinking about it and the morals of the story a great deal i agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centred around the sci fi aspects you might expect from an alien on earth movie but rather is about the human condition the characters in the psych hospital provide a great insight in to that and how they go from hopelessness to hope this movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final is he or isn't he that final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered i feel it is done in far more detail than something like say the movie ronin with robert de niro where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it i highly recommend k pax 8 10
<START> while traveling by train a woman stÃ©phane mistakenly gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night sooner she finds that a weird lonely jim van der that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track the man her in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them br br de is an overrated boredom with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere i like movies off hollywood but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality in the end i was absolutely disappointed with this feature my vote is three br br title brazil o homem da the man of the line
<START> in england we often feel very attached to british films that we like as we are so used to the usual american settings and accents being from london where virtual sexuality is set i felt a strong emotional attachment to it the characters in virtual sexuality particularly the females are exactly what british teenagers are like i felt like i was almost in the film i immediately related to the character of alex from the film his shyness is quite common in most british teenage boys especially around girls virtual sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only british films that isn't about gangsters or the middle upper class but about the people who are watching the film average teenagers americans wouldn't really feel the emotional attachment but every british teenager should watch it anyone from london will recognise the parts of the city from the film it's definately got a special place in my video box
<START> this is a movie that will leave you thinking is he or isn't he while many people have complained about the ambiguous ending it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs this is my interpretation and theory and i believe it is very sound br br first here is the plot one day kevin spacey suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station after attempting to help a woman from muggers he is arrested and sent to bellevue and later transferred to dr mark powell's jeff bridges hospital freely talks about how he came from the planet k pax and is here to do a report on earth naturally he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward he befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story in fact he tells them he can take one person back with him soon dr powell is beginning to question insanity and as the plot progresses it is harder and harder to prove wrong br br in the end dr powell learns that is robert porter a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in new mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered claims that he plans to leave for k pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders the time comes and goes and powell finds or robert in a catatonic state one of the patients is missing and is never found again br br on to my theory is not crazy is from the planet k pax robert porter is a friend of on one of previous visits to earth robert was a child learning about the constellations from his father and robert became best friends after the death of his family and robert slaying the murderer robert decides to commit suicide is on k pax at the time but he rushes back in of light speed to stop robert so takes over the thinking of robert taking over his body so to speak awhile later still inhabiting robert's body comes to new york and is locked up when he leaves for k pax on july 27 he takes bess with him but he must leave robert's body behind hence we now have the catatonic robert br br explanations or clues br br knowledge of the planets around libra as says any child knows about their own system only a few people on earth had an inkling about the system and added to their knowledge robert porter while smart and knows his constellations was no astro physicist br br dr powell feels chosen by it's true could've left the institute at any time but chose not too last words to dr powell are now that you've found robert take care of him was probably staying there to ensure a place for robert when he left br br super human abilities it was a proven fact that had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see uv rays provides his usual k pax reason but there was no earthly reason given it was also mentioned that was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect br br helping the patients throughout the movie you see helping the other patients or the patients discussing suggestions to a better sane world while the psychologist balk at help dr powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading br br the sprinkler scene the sprinkler is associated with porter's home in new mexico which is ironically where roswell is does porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family is her trying to protect powell's daughter from that horrible fate i have a different point of view it is assumed that porter had committed suicide in a river indeed under hypnosis is greatly concerned about robert i believe that associates the danger with the water not the sprinkler he is trying to protect the girl from watery death like he did robert br br hypnosis dr powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover true identity but while gives plenty of information he never gives up his persona and claimed homeland of k pax br br the security camera why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason br br mysterious disappearances first disappeared for a few days to his trip up north funny the patients are not at all alarmed indeed they try to reassure the doctor sometimes i think they understand better than the staff naturally the most telling disappearance is of bess the winner of the essay contest not only does she disappear at the approximate same time but the only remaining clue is her winning essay br br this is only my humble theory you can conclude what you want you can take dr powell's theory that was merely a persona taken up by robert porter to mentally defend himself from reality but that would be giving up too many plot holes
<START> three delinquents disturb the tomb of an ancient warlock who after summoning jack o a less then menacing pumpkin headed figure to dispatch said hoodlums continues on his sworn vengeance to kill every of the family that offed him that includes young sean kelly and his horror loving family of course it's up to sean to find a way to save the day br br such a stupid low budget b movie the acting's atrocious and the plot isn't much better throw in a extremely lame killer a possible pedophile who laughs way too much a couple of stereotypical cardboard cutout couple and you have this film in a nutshell not really worth your time save to see how superbly well linnea is aging br br eye candy linnea quigley is always good for some t a and she doesn't disappoint here with a lengthy shower scene rachel carter also gets topless although it could be a body double br br my grade d
<START> a cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes although you can't help but think of how low former '80's comedy golden boy steve guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production and playing a hard man too the plot is simple the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it not bad of its kind but not in the same league obviously as the films it is compared too on the cover such as air force one and con air the cast is good though with sean bean reprising his brit bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as goldeneye and patriot games
<START> the first question is how many talentless idiots it takes to screw a movie up answer one is more than enough if he writes the screenplay and directs it the second question is did anyone teach the actors to handle guns properly answer hell no i wonder if kristy swanson got hit across the face with hot brass because it damn seemed so the third question is how many times we did the super secret government agency conspiracy gets uncovered from inside plot answer a good couple too many the fourth question is are michael madsen and ron perlman overrated answer in this movie sadly yes the fifth question is can a pair of boobs save this movie answer even three kristy pair and the director writer didn't br br god if i see the most probably assassin getting her guns ready for a hit and then the morons from prop department give her a completely different set the first bloody thing in the goddamn movie the suck meter hits the peak time from beginning of the movie to me switching the tv off fifteen minutes just a little bit more than it took me in case of alone in the dark
<START> this short subject is a remake of the three stooges' 1942 film what's the matador about the boys' trip to mexico and their bullfighting adventures although the original short was made during the stooges' peak period it isn't that memorable and i believe it is one of the more mediocre films with curly howard br br having established that i believe that sappy bullfighters is just pathetically awful like all the other shorts with joe besser moe and larry never should have hired besser because his whiny almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the stooges his 16 films with moe and larry marked the nadir for the team and those shorts are embarrassing to watch this short was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with columbia maybe besser was a nice guy but he was all wrong as the third stooge br br i won't review any more besser shorts because i would just be giving the same scathingly negative review over and over do yourself a big favor and don't watch this instead try to catch in the sweet pie and pie or hoi
<START> this film is like a dirge until it gets to musical numbers which are like mind f ck but gentler like a mind caress mind foreplay the depressing vibe given from the speed desperateness of the characters can be pretty kill yourself awesome until you get to the musical numbers it's a great film optimistic weird manic depressive bipolar that's it this movie is bipolar anyway see it it's a musical with depth if you like the existential dross like the stranger or waiting for godot then your probably get a real kick out of this one i had to get the dvd through amazon com for like 12 oh the songs rock well they rock but they aren't rock there like jazz broadway but by grace chung i can't find the soundtrack nowhere but i wanna the songs are great the dances are so fun
<START> to be fair i couldn't bear to watch this movie all the way thru so i have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film but the first 30 minutes or so are amongst the worst i have seen in a while children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written acted and directed slapstick humor but adults in full control of all their faculties should steer clear of this stinker
