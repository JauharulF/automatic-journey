<START> when we all know no one does it like the bbc br br being an avid fan of this sort of sunday night watching i was quite looking forward to this how disappointed was i in the first thirty seconds i didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch br br however me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters the plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a robin style this modern style may have been able to be placed within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous cinematography but unfortunately we got neither the direction felt decidedly sloppy for both acting and shot choice br br after 30 mins we couldn't bare to watch it and went out and rented 'the which is very good btw maybe it is unfair that i judge this as i have watched so little of this but rarely have i felt so compelled to warn people not to watch something however me and my friends did think that the house and were pretty but thats as good as it gets
<START> when this showed at the seattle int'l film fest i was the only person standing and clapping and cheering the rest of the crowd booed or was silent it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity it is about a real man and does not play to the insipid hyper buffed muscular gay that passes for the genre of non porn gay cinema and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull this movie is intense and great tragedy the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate don't miss this if you can find it
<START> i am furious it has been a while since the last zombie movie i've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ol' gory zombie movie was a major disappointment a reasonable story but awful acting filming dialogue and nauseating clichÃ©s and punch lines i didn't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one now i am curious about how bad could that one have been the film is full of mistakes and goofs who on earth analyses dna using a blood sample why are these special forces who have been to hell and back fight like spoiled 6 year old girls we see ferocious zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two heroes take them down to the ground then let them go without even a scratch i could go on and on about this but life is too short and i have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry
<START> one of the best memories of my childhood should be on dvd it captured everything we grew up with in the seventies peace flower power and great acoustic music the two hosts carol and paula were the definitive hippies with long hair peasant blouses and bell bottoms they looked like a katherine ross ala the graduate and ali mcgraw ala love story respectively br br they made us happy with jokes from the daisy gave us lessons on being nice through conversations with the garden squirrel and entertained us with music from their guitar they were the best and carol was also the original sandy in the original production of grease cool br br this show should be in a time capsule from the era that would also include the yellow submarine arrow to the sun and thomas' free to be you me also sunshine and the point br br and last but not least that theme song see ya see ya hope you had a good good time ah ha glad we got to say good to ya hope we get get to see ya again see ya see ya glad that you could stay awhile ah ha hope we get see ya again see ya see ya
<START> i absolutely love this film everything about it it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece very original and creative i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some i'm really glad i ran across this movie if only there were more genius' like justin out there
<START> my caddy limo was destroyed well i had one just like it drove the hoi and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years br br that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you lordy what a bomb as in rpg go boom i also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick br br robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with unfortunately rutger hauer played his part like a red nosed circus clown if he couldn't take it serious why should his audience the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming br br the dialog was written by 10 yr old's for 8 yrs old's surprised there wasn't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets oh well i am a movie fanatic ergo you must take the bad to get to the good
<START> i just got back from after seeing it i'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film stone never has watched an nfl game in his life great cinematography give me a break the game montages were almost and 90 of the other shots in the film were close ups was there anything in this movie that wasn't brought up in north dallas forty br br aging star player check young hot shot check painkillers check owner who doesn't get it check crazy off field behavior check br br also it's the playoffs in dallas i e dec or jan in an outdoor stadium yet people sitting there in tank tops and shorts and what was with those lights were they playing in a japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium br br and the strategy shown in the game was laughable it's fourth 1 inside the sharks' 30 dallas leads 35 31 kick the frigging field goal not only would this had made sense football wise but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two point conversion hell tie the game w the extra point and stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime br br were the lame montages of old time football players supposed to be a tribute to the game give me a break br br and the script ugh more cliches than you can shake a stick at oops there's another one br br was better than this movie by far br br 1 10 br br skips this at all costs br br
<START> i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan i figured it couldn't be that bad boy was i wrong at the 15 minute mark i was the others to let me rip the dvd out and fling it back to the rental store but they refused they swore it had to get better br br they were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it none of the characters interacted very well with each other ice t gives one of his worst performances here br br after watching footage of the wrong plane bad guys standing up to get shot and clips being emptied and missing everything i wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete the movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may say br br i didn't finish this movie and hated it i don't want to finish this movie this is slow suicide i could feel my cerebral planning to avenge the torture i put it through
<START> i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo it is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale i was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played nanny she is an outstanding actress of course my favorite actor is terrance howard he is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received ebony magazine did do a nice article on him giving him some of his due blue gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us they were from a similar town philadelphia pa were they had to have their fun in the joints and such i also like to say that mos def is a incredible actor he has found his calling i've seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles from thug to doctor and he has the stuff overall please put blues on video for rental
<START> ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks this is one of those films it was slammed by the critics on it's release not least for the way it was funded i caught it on tv last night and gave in to curiosity br br in the event it is what it says on the box no more nor less low level humour crudity very much in the on ' vein but with 'adult' language indeed it harks back to the 60s 70s uk porn industry cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering spot the nipple that whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography br br it has the benefit of mackenzie crook the office pirates of the caribbean and much more and also johnny vegas the chip shop girl is genuinely sexy beyond these unexpected positives it does leave me wondering what happened to england junk food low paid work council estates desperate lives as a bonus there are some nice shots of leafy birmingham foreigners might find it informative about british attitudes and aspirations overall though i still feel disbelief that i sat through it
<START> i followed this entire series when i was a child in grade school by choice not because it was required for school i used to read the plays at the pace of the series the experience gave me a life long love for shakespeare and history it even gave me a bit of an acting bug although at an amateur level only whenever i read any of shakespeare's history plays the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production seen on a big furniture tv set with a rabbit ear antenna with all the ghosts and wobbles that go with that br br although the sets were minimal if i remember correctly that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were now i see that many of them have become well known over the years i particularly enjoyed and hal whom i now see were played by sean connery and robert hardy i would dearly love to see this available in video especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video it would be valuable also as a document of mid 20th century televised play production
<START> okay so ghoulies 4 is kind of bad and it doesn't really even have the ghoulies in it and the acting is bad the storyline is stupid but i forget to mention how funny this film is it is so campy and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy there are only 2 ghoulies in the movie and they don't really seem to be in relation with the ghoulies in the other film but they are pretty funny and funny thing that jonathon graves returns for this one if you saw the first he was a character in that in my opinion this is better than the first there are some classic scenes and some classic lines one which is in a grocery store attention k mart shoppers watch this if you enjoy bad movies it's so bad it is good and did i mention barbara alyn woods is hot
<START> this is another one of those fundamentalist christian movies that hit you over the head with religion like a sledgehammer you know you are in trouble when the setup of the story is completely ridiculous three men are flying to mexico to deliver bibles this makes no sense since the church is protestant and most mexicans are catholic protestant and catholic bibles are not the same the catholic bible has books in it that are not in the protestant bible i also find it difficult to believe that churches in mexico would not distribute bibles to them i can understand if they were going to a place where christianity is in the minority but mexico is far fetched if you cannot believe the setup of a story then you don't the rest of the story either a movie about religion can be entertaining but not this movie
<START> watched this film at a local festival the silver sprocket international film festival florida what a lovely film a simple uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions it neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change i wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language a real family film and the best british comedy film i've seen since billy elliot the film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of best film and best director ten out of ten
<START> the plot involves a new hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvin's barbershop so he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such sounds real exciting huh as for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film the people that work at calvin's stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like he's doing a stand up routine than anything to do with the movie and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money he's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end br br final verdict nothing new i don't recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread
