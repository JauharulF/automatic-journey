<START> caught this film on tcm in the early a m it was amazing br br starting out slow but ominously scott is a shady character who preys on women in this case two women who happen to be due an inheritance in southern california br br the sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing the title may have been more creative but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed almost in a hitchcockian version br br scott reminded me of the character uncle charley in shadow of a doubt one of hitch's reputed favorite films the audience learns we truly do not know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind this film is a displaced gem and well worth purchasing 10 10
<START> i was a projectionist while in the u s a f and remember this movie very well we had just been set up with stereo sound o o o o o well it was a big deal in 1959 instructions came with the reels the overture played while the projected curtain image was closed and i followed suit with the theater curtain closed too for intermission the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes i restarted the movie with the projection curtain closed while music used as a curtain call to the second part being the first stereo movie i had ever seen and being such a huge musical production i certainly enjoyed watching it every time i showed it for the run
<START> i like science fiction movies and even low rated made for tv bargain bin movies i may still find interesting well i found this one in a bargain bin and brought it as a selection to a movie night with a group of friends br br i was literally that i brought this movie br br right from the beginning the acting is bad the story is bland and the plot is almost non existent all this leads right to what the movie really was a soft core porno graphical movie br br the movie started with a woman prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine first clue that this movie is not serious attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical labor yeah right whatever p once the plot continued it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people having sex halfway through the movie my friends and i stopped watching it was so stupid the next day i thought that i would give the movie another chance and watch the rest i watched about another 15 minutes and gave up again br br if you are looking for a decent science fiction or even a sci fi monster movie do not watch lethal target if you want to see a low budget soft core porn that is light on plot then see lethal target
<START> the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film in fact the huge success of ma is also an evidence br br i'm not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the world br br and i'm not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country religion politics women's rights education general health terrorism law and many many more br br along came news about the fist saudi movie which should've been a remedy to some of the issues we have especially towards the youth instead we experienced a bald movie for that matter br br the ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a 13 year old had written it br br now i've heard that the budget for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing was poor the script was you really don't know what the story is and what the director aims at from this film br br a note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia they are not evil as this film intends in fact they are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what should've appeared in the film br br the youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them again this is what should've appeared br br we need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the money br br and we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the qur'an in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle
<START> this movie is by far the worst movie ever the story line is weak and never shows what happens to the people after the 20 was left they hands this really bugs me it drags on and on with out any meaning very boring the only good thing was the cast wow lots of big time actors and actress in it but besides that it was horrible terrible and repulsive do yourself a favor do not watch it br br i gave it a 1 out of 10
<START> seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i don't quite get it why has this been such a huge hit in 1986 its amateurishness drips from every scene the jokes are lame and predictable the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top that is not to say that miss does not have nice boobs the singing is the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid eighties it's really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 and apparently still today reading my fellow imdbers comments
<START> first real movie in this year amazing long shots sometimes with fix camera so specific for nordic cinema let aside dogma a true auteur film i find it it simply delighted all my senses and keep in mind how the image goes violent and painful during the scenes when he's trying to kill himself that's the point i don't think it stands up in the whole plot why if this was an ideal world couldn't you die but still you were keeping your conscience either was the real world with tailored rules or was a fantastic world but in this case no accidents like people remembering how it was before can happen br br it reminded me of kafka and maybe more of huxley's brave new world especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone since it was viewed like a right to pleasure it lacked a plot but i think it was better like this since you realized and sensed the whole strange behavior of everyone the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this happy world br br i think also that the end was brilliant true world is indeed a homo lupus you're eaten if you are not strong enough
<START> a woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides then again are these really suicides it seems as though there's a ghost on the loose guess what the ghost has long black hair that hides its face and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that making for a very weird looking specter recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost and bizarre sound effects which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped always accompany this hapless spirit does any of this sound familiar well if you've seen a few asian horror movies in the last 10 years it should borrowing heavily and unabashedly from the ring one last call and a few other recent horror hits this film tries to carry an uninteresting and worn out plot to a climax but we've seen it all before avoid it unless you're desperate or haven't seen any other asian horror movies in the last 10 years
<START> evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a sombre donald sutherland and potent support roles from donald pleasence and david the material decides to keep it all glum and moves from the investigation period into the back story of the victim the seldom and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in but when it flashback to the victim's side showing her final days weren't as compelling and became somewhat stodgy and stock like while the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone jarring and it's not helped out by its sloppy execution howard blake's music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger and director claude chabrol's capable handling well for most part has a strong stylistic and tight manner which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast the young faces lisa and landry do an incredibly good job as well
<START> based on the best selling novel by the kite runner is a story of friendship betrayal and the struggle for redemption set in afghanistan prior to the soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of taliban rule all of the elements are present for great drama but under the direction of marc forster finding neverland the film lacks the kind of searing emotional impact that makes for a memorable experience though it is entertaining well acted and occasionally moving br br set in 1978 in kabul but filmed in china because of the dangers in afghanistan the friendship that opens the film between two young boys is very real though they are miles apart in social and economic circumstances 12 year old amir lives in posh surroundings with his wealthy and educated father baba played by the great although his wealth seems a bit incongruous in one of the poorest countries in the world though baba is a loving father he confesses to khan shaun his friend and business associate that amir is too soft and that there is something missing with that boy the family has a servant ali who dotes on his every need and whose son hassan ahmed khan is best friend br br the two are separated not only by class but also by ethnicity amir a burgeoning writer is a member of the majority while hassan is a a minority sect 10 of the population though we learn little about their traditions or social situation they are bound together by their love of kite flying a popular sport in kabul and by reading afghan folk stories to hassan who is illiterate the annual kite flying competition to the boys is a big event in their lives and the cgi effects are breathtaking the kite strings are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kite string can cut down the other kites in the sky hassan is the kite runner who has an uncanny ability to locate the fallen kites and bring them to amir as a trophy after amir wins the important contest however a sad event occurs that will shape the rest of his life br br bullies led by the older who later appears as a ruthless taliban leader attack hassan because he is a and brutally rape him off camera while amir is too frightened to try and prevent it unable to confront his perceived lack of courage though one must wonder what if anything he could have done to help hassan guilt becomes the driving force in his relationship with hassan and their friendship becomes strained in one incident amir throws at hassan as if begging him to fight back and punish him for his passivity but hassan doesn't take the bait continuing to be loyal in spite of his friend's cowardice when amir urges his father to dismiss the servants and accuses hassan of stealing his watch hassan admits to the theft even though he is innocent eventually circumstances force ali and hassan to leave out of shame when the russians invade afghanistan baba and amir also leave fleeing to pakistan and then to california where the story picks up years later br br baba is forced to work at a gas station and to sell trinkets at an open air market while amir abdul seemingly going through the motions of living studies to become a writer at the local community college after he falls in love and marries leoni the daughter of a kabul general amir finally his first novel a season of ashes and things look very positive when amir receives a call from khan asking him to visit him in pakistan telling him there is a way to be good again the specter of guilt that has haunted him all of his life beckons amir to go home he returns to pakistan and with great risk goes back to an afghanistan now controlled by the taliban to confront the demons of his past and to discover a startling secret in the process br br the kite runner is a sensitive film that deals with the internal pain that comes from knowing that you were not true to your best instincts and allows for the possibility of moving beyond shame to a new level of responsibility it also does not hide the pain caused to afghanistan by wars and revolution a pain that is perhaps represented by the suffering hassan unfortunately it reduces complex situations to the level of good guys and villains and distorts what actually happened the u s who engaged in anti government covert operations within the country from any responsibility for the disastrous war that left over one million dead and millions more disabled though we are inspired by the outstanding child actors and moved by the freedom that kite flying represents the kite runner relinquishes its power when it attempts to substitute melodrama for history
<START> i kind of like jag it do have itÂ´s charm but lately itÂ´s to much propaganda in it for an outsider a non american the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much br br i donÂ´t like that and mackenzie goes from being lawyers as they were in the early parts of the tv show to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army br br i still watch the show so itÂ´s not that bad but i would prefer more episodes when and mackenzie investigates military accidents and donÂ´t save the world in the future
<START> i didn't know what to expect when i rented this widescreen dvd i knew it had a cult following but i had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent don't torture a duckling actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end and after all was said and done it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience one major caveat i would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read english subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly eve i'm afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james haven don wake i hope we see more of him what a great little film highly recommended to all
<START> and piper bring dr griffiths to their home to save him from the assassin while phoebe looks in the book of shadow how to vanquish the demon and piper fight and chase on the streets to destroy him however they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches they become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house phoebe trusts on cole and goes to the underworld with leo to ask him to summon and revert time while a fanatic woman shots piper who dies the source proposes phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save her sister phoebe accepts the deal and the time is reverted to the moment is attacking piper and dr br br all hell breaks loose is a good but incoherent episode with piper dead and the power of three destroyed why should the source revert time to save her but this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the third season and let the viewers anxiously waiting for the next episode my vote is nine br br title brazil no tempo back in time
<START> excellent piece of work br br i am not a surfer nor a skate board fan but work this good about sorting sock drawers would have been riveting a must see br br there is a lot to enjoy here excellent visuals great sound track mix huge body of documentary work both pictures and film br br the life work and love of the subject is captivating
