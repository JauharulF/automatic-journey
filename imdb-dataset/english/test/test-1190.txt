<START> where do i start lets list the good things about this movie first br br 1 mikael persbrandt is great as the gangster thomas this is the only character you will actually care about and he's a bad guy never does anything bad and is generally a pretty likable guy 2 is always great he's a bit toned down here but he is quite funny still 3 the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards good use of depth of field and lights br br now the bad this is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever the acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top the direction was horrible a totally meaningless story totally unrealistic characters and events and 1 5 hours to long during emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed people just started walking out during the course of the screening br br there's no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent so i wont even try every clichÃ© ever conceived is in there and in all the wrong places i'm sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life br br watch it for a good laugh but try not to pay any money for it br br r
<START> horrible writing directing and acting the writer director has portrayed southerners especially southern law enforcement as ignorant backwoods homophobic and racist a very popular yet ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to perpetuate the acting or overacting and the writing came across as amateurish and low budget the plot line is the same old stale hollywood story of the mean 'ol racist and homophobic rednecks who are ultimately defeated by the enlightened people from yoke br br i was raised in the small louisiana town where this movie was filmed and looked forward to seeing the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the movie the start of the film depicts a gay bar located in the swamps of louisiana how ridiculous a concept there are a lot of gays and gay bars in south louisiana but no gay bars in the swamps or small towns of louisiana we then are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases in the worst southern drawl and overdone performance ever then there is the scene where the local police are watching porno on duty in the police station i could go on and on about the horrible cheesy acting or the stale stereotypes or ridiculous scenes br br this director and his crew were welcomed into this small friendly town and shown true southern hospitality the townspeople of lake arthur and the state of louisiana were only to be insulted and degraded in the final editing the good people of lake arthur were excited and enamored with hollywood being in town not knowing that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant racist and homophobic country bumpkins in a low budget amateur movie that went straight to dvd my advice skip this one or watch it on late night cinemax if it ever makes their rotation
<START> horror films are a curious thing sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems sometimes they're so bad they're actually kinda fun and sometimes they're the cavern br br a good horror suspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die however the cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first only to be by it's own lackluster storytelling br br all the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way br br to spoil a scene a bit one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasn't reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick macaroni and cheese add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many nine inch nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level br br i'll be honest with you if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch the descent and i feel weird saying that because i didn't particularly enjoy that movie either
<START> this is a bottom of the barrel type of b film from one of the poverty row studios monogram in the mid '40s the kind that filled out a double bill br br only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder he played phil in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen aged roles he's no mickey rooney br br the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of clichÃ© ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals wanda mckay is the girl who is discovered by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who's afraid of his own shadow br br mercifully it's over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round up of all the suspects terribly overacted the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon as tex the cowboy but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance br br there are several songs but all of them are forgettable as are the lame jokes and dialog
<START> so well made no cgi crap has anyone else been on the jumping crocs tour of darwin's adelaide river before black water was way realistic rogue was a bit cringeworthy br br thought the blonde chick was excellent in it haven't really seen her before and the other chick is a babe she is always excellent br br v suspenseful i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick br br got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with and as well br br loved it
<START> i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the set br br i am sure that george zucco was a good actor but this was only the second film in which i saw him the first being dead men walk in which he played two parts however even good acting couldn't save the mad monster br br zucco plays a mad scientist dr cameron who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another br br in this case like so many others of its ilk it is a transfusion of i assume wolf's blood into humans his goal is to create an invincible army which he can control through the antidote the subject of his experiments is his hired hand a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows down this snail paced classic to almost a full stop br br beyond his experiments dr cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him using his transformed gardener however he loses control of his subject who begins to transform without the transfusion yikes br br the werewolf transformations are classic hollywood stop action makeup effects no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time but in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this
<START> this movie was painfully awful most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods walking thru the woods or dancing in the woods more than half at least then two kids who discover two mutilated bodies' in the woods return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk there is no time continuity its day its night its day its really really night its dusk its pitch black its day all the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind really bad the sheriff discovers a five foot claw print embedded in the dirt of the woods and that a super large alligator may have learned to walk upright really a silly movie with no real motivation written in for the characters might be entertaining for young kids as an alternative to really graphic stuff
<START> this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie br br if i took this movie to heart as someone who knows and believes the bible i would have canned it pretty quick but i don't think the general atmosphere was either mean spirited or blasphemous it was just ludicrous or just plain stupid br br i mean john travolta as a grubby angel smoking scratching his groin quoting the beatles a warring angel who knows nothing about heaven an angel who flirts with all the women yes it's all absurd and certainly biblically incorrect br br i could tolerate all that but i don't know how many people whatever beliefs they hold who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and andie macdowell some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it's insulting to any discriminating viewer br br this is another nora ephron directed film man i can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed at least she's consistent
<START> moon' is an adequate made for tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town where br br she grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered turns out that every year on the same date another br br young girl is murdered and tori played by claire forlani must solve the mystery before she ends up dead claire forlani meet joe black csi new york is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it ably supported by the rather delicious oliver and a still luminous jacqueline bisset the script adapted from a nora roberts novel is bog standard and the plot br br is tediously predictable that however is offset again by like i said the rather delicious oliver hudson
<START> if as i just pointed out in the goat keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law this langdon short the last released before he did tramp tramp tramp was based on another comic ploy being married to a shrewish spouse and trying to get away for some secret two timing dating laurel hardy did this in several films as did fields and chaplin br br i have a problem with it why do these characters always marry such nasty women and there is an interesting sociological side issue why don't you find female comics married to male counterparts to these shrews i can't recall any except in a carol burnett skit where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get a kind of mutual sado masochism but also reassurance that their not married to a namby pamby type as for the fact that the comics do marry shrews i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve or do they ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him yeah he went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans but he wanted to get some private time there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives actually he is creamed by mae busch because he lied to her while stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife br br here harry's wife alice ward is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control we see harry at his job it is saturday morning and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend this was before the idea of a five day a week 40 hour a week job in industry he works in a where he hits red hot metal into shape an early joke about langdon he is a small light man not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer he just misses his streetcar trying to give a man a light he calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late br br on the way home harry meets his pal steve vernon dent who has met two nice sweet girls who would just love to have a date harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl he agrees to pay for the hot dogs for the foursome he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket but his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden cache of coins he keeps it hidden under the living room rug and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug but his wife spies on him and confiscates all of it later she overhears him talking to himself and berating her in contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a soda br br but harry has a second cache of coins and dresses up for the date and goes out he and dent are apparently late and dent blames harry but harry tries to make it up to him he produces two prostitutes they get into a quarrel when dent wisely says they are not the type of girls he'd term as nice eventually the girls do show up and the date begins but soon harry is hiding in the rumble seat as his wife drives past in her roadster and the girls boy friends turn up angry at their two rivals br br the short works well and is amusing and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master he is constantly put upon by others he misses his streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light and in the end the stranger gets his own the nice girl who is harry's date has a little dog who chases him away he rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole it certainly demonstrates that langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time that he made his features if only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features
<START> br br having read the unemployed critic's review i went to a screening of radio not knowing what to expect thankfully the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film director movie critic his review is callous and totally uncalled for br br this is a movie that will make you laugh it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause br br to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio truth is he was teaching us he treats us all the time like we wish we treated each other some of the time br br yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr in an oscar worthy performance is a little over the top at times see the christmas day dance scene but you know what so what every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country we need to be reminded how great we can be br br this is a solid cast i was particularly pleased to see s portraying radio's mother do something outside of law and order i always wondered is ms a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor br br also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal debra winger in a career resurrecting role of coach jones's wife and chris as protagonist frank clay br br we cannot over look ed harris's performance as coach harold jones after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self it is hard to truly appreciate mr harris and his contribution to this film as coach jones ed delivers a quiet rock solid performance that of a man on a mission coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do br br if you see this movie make sure you hang around for the end credits you will be in for a treat as the real james robert kennedy now in his mid 50's is shown still leading the t l hanna football team on to the field every friday night br br one final note if you were a teen in the mid to late 70's this movie is worth the price of admission for the sound track alone
<START> from the late teens to the 1920s stan laurel was a solo act in films during this time period laurel was definitely not among the upper echelons of talent and his humor isn't nearly as good as contemporaries such as lloyd or keaton however for second tier short comedies he did create a decent niche as far as the quality of the films go they varied wildly some such as dr and mr were terrific whereas most were of average to below average in quality br br frozen hearts is an odd film like many of the films he made for hal roach and distributed by during this period the costumes were absolutely first rate and the film looked very nice however despite this and having support from the likes of james finlayson one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor none of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama not a comedy only the really silly intertitle cards betray the type film it's supposed to be br br my advice is try to see all his laurel and hardy films and then see the solo films in addition to dr try seeing the and mud and sand two of his more tolerable solo shorts
<START> abysmal indonesian action film from legendary triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like and 'do or die' with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet this guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as tom selick powerful at least the action is mindless and non stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and or meth addicts with no concept of reality one poor extra gets ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as i would rather trust a rattlesnake are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third rate voice actors random highlight some crazy dude eating live lizards movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls 2 10
<START> so umm this woman has a vagina that sucks people into it when they umm do it and there's this dude who like follows her around everywhere and uhh is umm in love with her and she cant love him back because of her thingy well her thingy starts talking to her sort of it just says feed me over and over and she tries to feed it hot dogs but that doesn't work because it wants fresh meat so this woman heads to the red light district where she picks up tourists but only the really sleazy ones cause i guess they deserve it and after a while this dude comes looking for her and even though shes like right there he doesn't see her so eventually he gets involved with conjoined twins but he only likes one of them cause the other is a real hussy this isn't bad good like i thought it would be cause like the novelty sort of wears off within the first 1 2 hour and it goes on for another hour i think it killed off a few brain cells cause i sat through this whole thing and now im a little brain damaged either way man this is the worst man eating vagina movie i have ever seen
<START> of course going into it one would expect it to be a typical stupid t a flick and it is but it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments given the era in which it was made and the obvious exploitation aspect it is still one of the better b comedies of the time br br while watching this movie you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in revenge of the nerds and numerous other films of the same genre most of the acting is horrible and way over the top but that's exactly what i expect in a movie like this what it lacks in the way of acting ability it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit br br the amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money that went into it films like this made today just don't have the same style if you can turn your brain off and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half you will enjoy this flick i dare anyone to not find at least something in this movie that they think is funny if not hilarious
