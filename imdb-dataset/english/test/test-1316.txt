<START> iâd been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the worst film ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci fi cinema in a british periodical from the early 1980s entitled âthe incidentally the leonard maltin film guide also awarded this the unenviable bomb rating when it came out on dvd last year i became interested in purchasing the camp box set in which it was included along with queen of outer space 1958 and the giant behemoth 1959 however since recently acquiring queen on dvd r i had put paid to the idea br br happily iâve just stumbled upon the film on divx â however the print wasnât culled from the warners dvd which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasant looking transfer but rather a muddy tv not so much that the detail is lost in other words it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to black and white anyway to get to the matter at hand i have to admit that in a way i was disappointed the film didnât prove to be the laugh fest i had anticipated all this time maltin calls it actually i found it quite engaging â and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length some undeniably amusing bits remain though â such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50 foot woman and when the deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case neither did the special effects hit me as being the maltin again on film â though certainly embarrassingly bad br br o k so the idea that an alien in giant sized human form clad in cave man rags and radioactive to boot coming to earth in a big ball shaped spaceship and apparently after the prized necklace is utter nonsense â and his quasi transparent appearance does it no favors at really itâs the human story that holds our attention relatively speaking the character of the philandering husband isnât very interesting but his two women are wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife allison hayes and ambitious girlfriend yvette vickers also involved in the narrative are faithful servant already mentioned a couple of cops one of them as noted elsewhere being amiably goofy and as many doctors one of whom is named dr cushing and another a specialist whoâs called in when hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation br br of course the film could be seen as the reversed female version of the incredible shrinking man 1957 â though it be fair to compare the two further as the jack arnold richard matheson classic is far more psychological intellectual in approach actually hayes doesnât seem to be that bothered with her and in fact takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson however her rampage â exaggerated in movie posters of the era â is rather quaint especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand especially when lifting the puppet thatâs supposed to be her husband sheâs mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by still demise via electrocution when she bumps into an electrical cable is competently done br br finally i followed this with its 1993 tv remake with daryl hannah as the titular creature â which i rented specifically for this purpose
<START> i think that just sums up this film watch it and you'll find out why the acting of the lead character john is really really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever it's very funny because of this thought as is the ending where beheads the bad guy despite the fact he is unarmed and has surrendered brilliant
<START> i have watched this movie countless times and never failed to be charmed by it's homely simplicity sincerity and goodness great characterizations by all of the cast and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role i confess i fell in love with roberta in 1970 and she still touches me today shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day the nicest present i could have had
<START> synopsis the sequel to the acclaimed silence of the lambs hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver not only is it not as clever as its predecessor it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie just a totally boring time waster do not be fooled by the media hype and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain eating scene in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad sfx why so many people in this forum are claiming that h is not all bad and worth watching on the big screen etc is beyond me and it is not so bad it's good either it is just plain boring i normally respect other people's opinion but in this case i have to say that they clearly can not tell from shine ola maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype maybe they have never seen a ridley scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting smoke and the ubiquitous ac fans h is totally devoid of suspense instead we get endless scenes of lecter swanning through an english speaking a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net after seeing h i actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot and when i wrote them down i quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen i would advise you to wait until it comes on tv in a couple of years and then to go to bed early br br 1 10 br br below are a couple of extra bones i have to pick with hannibal br br h is the sequel to despite what some people in this forum are claiming and even though was a very tough act to follow there are sequels which are en par with their predecessors itself was the sequel to michael mann's manhunter based on thomas harris' red dragon and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film was even better another example would be the alien series initiated by h's director ridley scott so much for the theory of diminishing sequels in any case being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap br br this movie has a renowned director it is based on a novel by the same author as the cast is strictly a list great cinematography big budget first rate script writers yadda yadda yadda and the end result is simply a fart in the church so what went wrong i think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer dino here is my interpretation ddl produced manhunter which despite of all its qualities was a commercial flop disappointed he gave the rights for the hannibal lecter character to orion for free allowing jonathan demme to make and the rest is cinema history ddl then had to wait for ten more years he is now 81 until thomas harris finally came up with the sequel novel i think at this point ddl had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork br br another aspect that i find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media i mean it is boring yet one of the highest grossing productions ever so there is no need to give it free publicity and while most reviewers harp on about how dantesque the scenes in are and why jodie foster did not participate the simple fact that this movie is an utter utter utter flop goes unmentioned but there is more not only is hannibal being hyped through the roof it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of documentaries usually the left overs from similar productions in the wake of about serial killers cannibalism and profiling however not only does h not even pretend to be realistic lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer he now only kills out of necessity or to help clarice starling profiling is not even mentioned because we already know so there is no need to create a profile and there is also no cannibalism lecter feeds the drugged up paul his own brain so that makes it erm unaware auto cannibalism try making a documentary out of that br br much has been said about the acting mainly whether julianne moore can replace jodie foster and anthony hopkins who plays the lead hannibal lecter is usually given a lot of praise i think all of these discussions are moot there are several of my favourite actors in this movie namely liotta oldman and moore but the script simply does not give them anything to work with same for hopkins there is no development in his character and he is not being challenged in any way and by the way he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies only that in h he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of 11 million to do it

<START> this soap is worse than bad it's poisonous of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years eastenders is the prime example for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf the thug the wide boy the tart the the violent the sexually the criminal the ignorant the br br how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders mirrors life life on which planet exactly br br it's written about working class characters as imagined by middle class people who have taken a course in creative writing eager to show to their middle class peers how familiar they are with the working class they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders br br this has a toxic effect on some minds less well equipped than others to handle fiction and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of br br thus it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders br br other soaps have followed in footsteps filled to their stinking with ugly potato faced shaven headed pot bellied characters scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified meanwhile the burgeoning number of new tv induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy br br and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated of dancing in the corner of your living room it's your fault gentle reader that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison
<START> this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen it just wasn't funny my wife fell asleep i suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you if you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an english radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious the strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom what did happen in the strip club made no sense at all there was a great deal of mumbling by the lead character with whom i developed no sympathy at all mena suvari was hardly in the film presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film the bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep
<START> terrific acting by the 5 stars makes this one a must see br br based on a stage play the silver cord is about mother love at its worst the film was very controversial for its implied homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural romantic feelings for both sons br br irene dunne stars as the new bride and biologist who travels with husband joel mccrea to visit the family before heading off to new york city for their new jobs but something seems wrong br br the mother laura hope crews seems rude to the younger son's eric linden fiancÃ©e frances dee but dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores a few of the strange things the mother says then she finds out her room is down the hall from and his room mother's room br br later she walks in as mummy is in mccrea and kissing him on the lips good night mummy has also been working on linden and getting him to doubt his feelings for dee everything blows up and with dee running into the snowy night toward the frozen pond as the boys run after her mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their coats dee falls through the ice and is rescued br br as the girls leave the house the following morning dunne lets mummy know what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys but mummy has a tight hold faking illness and forever boasting of her sacrifices the girls leave but the boys stay behind br br crews is magnificent as the voracious mother repeating her stage role it's a part few actresses would dare play the sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 film and crews take advantage of her best film role dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing mccrea dee has some excellent scenes after she gets dumped by bewildered linden all 5 stars are terrific in this drama that is bizarrely underrated and unknown br br a neglected gem for anyone who likes great acting
<START> this is a rip off from cellular br br bad casting br br bad direction br br bad music br br and the list goes on br br well there was no direction since story scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie br br even fight sequence is copied one with the mace was from kill bill and another one with fire hose was from either a jet li's or jackie chan's movie i am not able to recall the name of this movie br br stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing br br cannot expected something original from any of the bhatts any more
<START> this is s superbly crafted top notch washington thriller directed by the talented wolfgang petersen with hotshot screenwriter jeff maguire who seems to have done very little over the years so maybe he tends his roses the film has clint eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and john malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity where the president's life is at stake unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the president which is an authentic touch this film was made when both eastwood and malkovich were at their peak probably eastwood has never done a better job than he does here and it is all so effortless for the old pro there are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the president's car as a bodyguard for which he is too old i wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added my angel' whose name is vigil enjoyed this movie even more than i did but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing rene russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for eastwood as she is so but so talented and she shines the tension is taut every inch of the way in this story and the psychological struggles of eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting with eastwood if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter watch out of course he is the master of the super cool malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection what a good 'un
<START> boy this movie is bad and not in a good cheesy fun way either even mst3k couldn't stop it from being boring and it's also confusing as all get out but the most annoying part of this dull mess is ireland's hideous high pitched voice which i was tired of listening to in the first five minutes not to mention how really unappealing her character is even her dad ran away and abandoned her i can see why frankly if he'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes he'd have been tempted to do her a great harm as i was by the end of the movie plus she's useless and annoying when she falls down the long hole in the earth a la alice in wonderland she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably australian accented miner hadn't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into he should have just tied her to the atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it and this atlantis underground with the weird confusing obsession with bone density i have to ask where was the light coming from down there did they have generators that imitate the sun no matter there's no real plot anyway just a bunch of oddly costumed goth wannabees running around trying to catch kathy probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth stupid pointless film thank you golan globus for this cinematic abomination may you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity
<START> recovery is a well judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn't sentimentalise the main characters david tennant and sarah parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident br br tennant as alan brings humour as well as a dangerous as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life sarah tricia is not a clichÃ©d stand by her man housewife who will do anything to support her husband she struggles with falling out of love with alan as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person a stranger to her br br contrary to some opinion this in my view makes perfect sunday night viewing too often we are shown soft family dramas or detective series like heartbeat which rot and the brain programme seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep more challenging and thought provoking drama like recovery would seriously change the situation
<START> hard up no proper jobs going down at the pit why not rent your kids diy pimp story without the gratuitous sex scenes either hard core or soft core therefore reads like a public information film from the fifties give this a wide miss use a barge pole if you can
<START> this is a decent effort for a b movie martial arts actioner ian a former north american cruiser weight kickboxing champion is the lead and acquits himself well in the action scenes the muscular matthias hues gets a chance to add more to his martial arts bad guy persona in this film than in all of his many others and if you are a fan of the teutonic titan rent this movie now br br renee griffin is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film she starts off with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make the beast with two backs in a very stylish fashion br br the fight scenes are good in the american tradition no hong kong acrobatics here with added realism from having benny the jet urquidez playing himself as john larson's trainer br br all in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get more of a story
<START> new rule nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea br br sadly this movie doesn't they have the premise that bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers well problems with that most people have ten fingers why not just collect ten for one zombie why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a zombie finger br br not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle br br i sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and fx guys hey this is what i did with ten dollars and some bottles deposit imagine what i could do if you gave me a budget do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie i went to the school of the arts check me out as the tunnel zombie in quick and the undead his mother must be so proud br br these had to be the wimpiest zombies ever as a whole crowed of them apparently couldn't push down a wooden door or even break a glass window no they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them
