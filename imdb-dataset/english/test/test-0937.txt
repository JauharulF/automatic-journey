<START> if jacqueline mckenzie and john lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one and well worth exploring however on the negative side the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses and the music choices more and more bizarre so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying
<START> after working on 7 movies with director curtiz the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement errol flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great raoul walsh this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography the died with their boots on is their first and best film together raoul walsh portrays the general george armstrong custer errol flynn from his debuts at west point to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn it's true the film shows a too heroic portrait of custer but that's not important what is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters who can forget california joe the great queen's own with his song the touching mrs custer olivia de havilland the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy br br an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic
<START> ok so i'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door i open the door and what do i see in her hands sleepy hollow high i thinking it has to be an older horror movie because there's noway anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after the blockbuster hit sleepy hollow starring johnny depp but to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original that alone should have stopped me from putting it into the v c r but no i had to take a chance i had to believe that this movie could have one small ray of hope little did i know that the rays where no where to be seen br br number one the story line is so ridiculous that it's probably true in some country bumpkin town two the actors seem more like people real life people who just happen to wonder on the set when the director yell cut three just about any movie starring the director is always awful but the funny thing is that this is yet another movie directed by kevin i've become to rely on his movie to bring me to the floor with side splitting laughter br br where to start on this movie i know let's start with the jogger in the woods the camera lighting was so bad that i lead to believe that the jogger was standing still and the camera man was running i love how the woman's stop to eat a candy bar i mean it's just about dark or just about light who could tell with the camera lighting and she stops running to eat a candy bar i mean a candy bar what the hell so she ends up being the first victim because of stupidity and already i'am ready to break the tape find the director burn his little hands br br then out of nowhere some guys like trying to fix a car that probably been broken for some years now then in come the fake mack 10 and a very real prostitute who happen to be part of our main charter cast br br the some of the movie is about a group of kids who all get into trouble and are given the choice to pick up trash in the sleepy hollow park or face suspension forever there sent in the woods with one of the teachers mr e or a k a kevin who suppose to watch over them and make sure that all goes accordingly the funniest thing is how undeveloped the charters really are i mean what is with the fake mack 10 dude and who's ever heard of hacker trying to kill themselves and some how one of the students has had an affair with the teacher mr e before all of this community service crap had even came up yet the school still thought it was a cool idea for them to let him go also there's one student named j who purpose in the movie is to keep annoyingly popping up out of no where trying to make the audience jump when all he really does is add to the cheapness of the film the sound was so horrible in this movie i mean there was one seen when two guys are fighting and the guy punches the other guy in the stomach and out of the t v comes this sound effect that sounds like someone punching a stale wooden box it began horribly and ended dangerously stupid even my taste i will say this though the music in the back ground made the scenes look some what tolerable but not that much tolerable my conclusion is this if you want to left at yet another movie that kevin took serious buy sleepy hollow high br br p s i'am still thinking about shooting myself to remove those images of the fake mack 10
<START> a middle aged man robert jordan set in his ways takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set he has a rough go at first with the boys especially so with mike an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated do things work out for jordan and the scouts check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days
<START> this is the best movie i have ever seen it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy br br the most splendid casting i have ever seen patrick swayze and james read were top grade in this movie br br if you see part 1 you will want to see it all some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie br br i am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history any movie that can get children to learn history is great i have books i ii iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north south
<START> is definitely my most favorite movie i've worn more than one tape as it is the make up is awesome the story is lovely it takes a few different twists and isn't quite as deep as the story it's based on cabal by clive barker but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material the only problem with this movie were the producer's vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie hence the changed ending to allow for sequels eye rolls apparently someday we're going to be getting a director's cut that will i hope clear up this bit of nonsense until then i'd suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddy jason micheal type slashers i really don't know what would be comparable
<START> i was only fourteen when i first saw the alien movies and i immediately came to like it original terrifying and classic sigourney weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her act in 1979 something everlasting was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first was a different point of view but i think this part was the most stressful and unique of all this was my favourite unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways it was strained illogical with full of meaningless massacres i didn't like it at all but i never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future well as it turned out in 2004 i was wrong alien vs predator was a bad break and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all but when i saw alien vs predator requiem i was totally shocked moreover devastated when i sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt even than i had never thought that such a bad movie could be made without a screenplay without a director and without actors i don't understand how can a film be made because this film misses these three terms what you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues waste of money and waste of time this movie is rather impudence than honor to the fans of the both sides alien predator shame
<START> i saw this movie with an open mind not knowing what to expect i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was written directed and acted in such a manner that every minute of it is a delightful watch the people don't seem like they're acting more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie there are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chuckle some jokes may be dry but are presented in a very viewable fashion highly recommended
<START> i watched this movie to see the direction one of the most promising young talents in movies was going unfortunately with this movie leelee sobieski has chosen a path not only well worn but completely free of any meaningful destination this movie used every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen tap you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have your heartstrings so that it may give them a good tug romance can be done well and when it is the viewer is left feeling the love portrayed on screen during the emotional climax of this movie i laughed heartily to save you the time and money i would suggest instead of seeing this movie you have a meal of karo syrup and velveeta it's about the same
<START> this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre where the people didn't leave immediately when the end credits started in stead they remained seated for a few minutes gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite trying to understand what they 've just seen br br the only thing i can say try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible so did i i gave it a 10
<START> lame b horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her when said lodger is killed off mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authorities br br my main complaint is that this film should have brought the funny it failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the b movie crowd happy i've seen worse but i wouldn't give this one a rec 4 5 10
<START> he plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history roy scheider stars in a poor man's french connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal fc is a better movie but i prefer watching this one because 1 i think scheider is great and this is his best movie and 2 this has the best car chase ever one that makes bullitt look like a cable production thanks again to bill hickman who actually plays the driver it doesn't hurt that tony stops by again to play a baddie please enjoy
<START> i hope that matt dorff's original script for this was much better there are signs of it dialogue that should happen well before big f x scenes to introduce characters that would make sense much earlier is jammed in later in the time line perhaps the original script was for a longer running time but maybe not in any case this reeks every character is uninteresting and everybody speaks expository passages as if they are speaking the word of god there are characters that are entirely expository dianne secretary abbot is just awful explaining things to her assistant and incidentally us in endless speeches that no one would say to anyone ever in real life when she isn't explaining things to her assistant that she already knows her assistant explains things to her that she already knows there are characters who are entirely one dimensional the evil power company guy the pilot who will just not shut up about his personal life and concentrate on his job the well meaning power company hacker guy who can crash br br everything in chicago including the phones and then gives the oh no what have i done speech but not leave himself a back door the crusading reporter who abandons her principles at the drop of a hat the power company shift supervisor who abandons his post in the middle of the worst crisis in chicago since the fire with no consequences hospitals abandoned by the doctors and nurses during the crisis i'm not kidding that's in the movie br br oh yeah and it's filled with hollywood morality clichÃ©s generally women are good men are evil unless influenced by a woman the ultimate is the punk with the gun deprived of a woman's influence he literally goes insane an evil stupid act like what the reporter did with hacker bozo is all right so long as you well' evil men die capitalist evil men die as horribly as possible everybody else lives well except randy quaid and did i hear someone say that the nuclear electrical power generating stations had to shut down because there wasn't electricity to run the safety systems think about that one br br there is one ray of sunshine if you'll pardon the expression randy quaid basically plays his character from independence day you know hello boys i'm this time as a storm chaser with an infinite range suv and batteries for his camcorders nevertheless they kill him mostly it seems so that the audience will appreciate that tornados are pretty dangerous things kinda shallow that br br give this one a pass
<START> i think that pierre lÃ©aud or his character to be precise is really outlandish but with grace i also remember the chess player and of the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home something really curious the woman acting as the lawyer is to me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen but i must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously the character who plays as the lead theater actor is really nice especially when he's annoyed by the new actor the one in purple t shirt also the scene where the bearded actor who belongs to another company directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing as it often happens with this movie for example when they drink tea they just make you want to have a cup
<START> some spoilers br br this movie is sometimes subtitled life everlasting that's often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical send off br br there's a hey kids let's put on a show air about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances co writer co producer tom fontana and his pals pack the goings on with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real baltimore personages br br that's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television's show varied casts your old favorites as well as later non favorites br br there was always a tug of war pitting quality conscious executive producer barry levinson fontana james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget conscious nbc execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like nash bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it br br unfortunately for this movie fontana co writers yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members br br briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of baltimore's homicide unit yaphet kotto as lt al giardello is now a kurt schmoke like candidate for mayor and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn br br the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardello's son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as gee's son or is esposito that uncomfortable in the role br br to be fair esposito doesn't get a chance to play out the main story without interruption that's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters br br an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect but zaljko ivanek's harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered later br br let's summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire maryland legislature the u s attorney general nbc court tv the bbc ap reuters people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the economist the johannesburg mail and guardian l'osservatore romano le figaro paris match l'equipe and computer world weren't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case br br nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out there's quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on display br br two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to satirize this presenting jason priestley as the latest big deal detective on the other hand they give easy come easy go michelle forbes a very affecting scene br br there's some other sly casting with actual lt gary d'addario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the children's show beloved by the inmates on fontana's oz dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself br br even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed begley jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor ehrlich from fontana's st elsewhere he's still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didn't st elegius turn out to be an autistic boy's fantasy br br the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy this movie was made when court tv bought re run rights to the series that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomers br br although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spin off br br as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are saddled with a loser script andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever br br it's fun to watch top pros do their stuff it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it
