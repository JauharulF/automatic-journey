<START> neal n nikki is voted on of the worst films of the year by its hard to believe the famous chopra's have produced this lousy movie it was presented as a movie for the family but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy nor does it make you laugh but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy the title song is the most annoying song of the decade i'm the neil i'm the man rock star superstar chopra is one of worst actors ever with no acting talent after making many super flops and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his family he gives a total crap performance that bores you to death who is and will always be known for being sister gives a dreadful performance both actors have the most annoying chemistry and are very immature for their age it has a special appearance by the very cute in a pathetic role the ending was so daft and stupid i cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap
<START> i was not old enough to really appreciate the original mod squad but i knew everyone thought it was cool i have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screen to print collection and they're pretty light duty so i didn't expect much from the movie that's a good thing because this movie was bad on a long leash br br i admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit the movie audience though has gained sophistication in 30 years at least i think so i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original mod squad concept with now old car chases now considered poor camera work tinny sounding soundtrack and poor script and all on the big screen in the 1960s we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough it was that another thrilling episode of ironsides or password br br rating this episode against usual theatre releases the story was well i'm not sure i should even say because i'm not sure there was one drugs are bad whatever the script was silly when the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like i overheard him say so on the phone and i think i got a plan we really are in trouble no wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic lines br br if i were claire danes i'd be going after my agent with a flame thrower right now actually i think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution br br and where was the mod in that squad i realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall but no one had a velvet suit mod only meant young and integrated what happened to white go go boots perhaps the costume department was going for gritty but all they got was dirty and dingy br br since the movie was completely true to the original series and required special behavior from the actors cameramen stunt men etc we should appreciate it more unfortunately i still don't like it if i wanted to watch 60's crime drama i'd buy dvds no thanks
<START> it was a terrific movie i like to watch it again and again the actors were awesome the movie kept me on the edge of my seat i would recommend this movie to anyone i wish lifetime would put this movie on dvd i would most definitely purchase a copy this movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with you may think you know someone but you never know my daughter watched the movie with me she thought it was great all i know is i will watch this movie every time lifetime airs it it's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the t v i wish lifetime would redo the movie but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen
<START> the pace of the film is ponderously slow in parts but if you can tune into its languid speed and lengthy silences then it is a satisfying piece of intrigue the story of the first emperor of china his childhood sweetheart and the personal cost of power the film is very atmospheric the extremely mannered and polite ceremony and ritual contrasted with sudden brutal violence filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces battle scenes are rare and short the focus is on the battle within the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means the emperor's journey from idealistic peacemaker to ruthless tyrant is aiming to be subtle but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the emperor indeed his actions and aims do not really change throughout only gong li's attitudes to him are altered the most interesting performances are gong li's and the titular assassin as they reassess when to fight when to retreat when to kill the most expensive film ever made in china at the time the emperor and the assassin does not rely on hysteric emotion or big battles but rather a brooding atmosphere of menace and inevitability gong li fans will be unsurprised to hear she is as stunningly beautiful as ever giving an understated performance
<START> this movie is the funniest danish movie i've ever seen br br the plot is funny surprising and danish humor is unlike any other and it gets you every time the entire audience laughed 90 of the time it was incredible the characters are so well played and the two actors mads and nikolaj lie play their best ever br br i would highly recomend seing this movie you won't regret it believe me
<START> black water is one of the most tense films i have viewed in a long time the story moves fast as it follows three tourists all great actors into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp they are flipped over by something huge in the water br br hastily the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them throughout the next two days they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodile's evil watchful eye and he doesn't seem to want to go away the movie drags just a tad bit but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget it's so much better than primeval and other recent crocodile underwater predator thrillers the tension is heavy and all three leads give terrific performances truly chilling this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me apparently based on true events
<START> this movie could have been great it is not in my opinion the storyline is fragmented the editor appears not to be able to choose between a guy ritchie style of storytelling and a more straightforward one there is a great emphasis on excessive violence including torture too much so if you ask me the characters are very shallow and stereo typed i would have liked to see more depth there it is hard to identify with the main character as a result the movie remains shallow as a whole br br the movie says it gives the spectator an inside view of the british criminal underclass more in particular the essex underclass football hooligans steroids cocaine heroine and violence lots and lots of violence violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general in this movie no one seems to use his or her brain we're looking at a bunch of animals in clothes like i said there is not much of a plot and the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired br br if you're a male below 30 like gore and hardcore violence and think that's entertaining than this is a movie for you if you're looking for a movie portraying real people with a well developed storyline suspense and depth well you can skip this one
<START> i am not familiar with the producer's other works but this movie is a piece of crap br br i never saw the mst3k version but i can tell you mike and the bots probably didn't save it br br i love a grade z movie as much as the next bad movie fan but this was almost unwatchable br br there was no credit for who did the voice of the dark one sounded a bit like patrick stewart at times br br a group of high school students who found a junk super 8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that
<START> i watched this film on the advice of a friend who assured me it was one of the funniest things he'd ever seen sadly this person is completely lacking a sense of humour and i was forced to endure two hours of the worst film making i have ever seen please do not watch this film 1 10
<START> i had a very hard time sitting through this film unless you really are very pro adultery and like to hear people endlessly talking about their sexual exploits i can't see how you could enjoy this film geez most of the main characters behaved like rutting weasels and their bragging about their many infidelities grew tiresome about the only element of this i appreciated was the disgusting scene where the one character was urinating and blood was splattering everywhere because he'd picked up an std big surprise hmm br br if you want a good film watch the sequel barbarian invasions despite the general unlikable nature of many of the characters the sequel is very involving and more realistic well worth your time
<START> this movie is sort of similar to better off dead as it has some of the same stars this one though isn't quite as good granted it is rather funny and enjoyable there is something about better that i like well better this one has these guys going to to spend there summer vacation while there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant this guy really doesn't seem to like lobsters cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream the main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown kind of like in summer rental though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better though what is the deal with boat races at this time was there some weird fascination with them for the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip but better off dead was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better
<START> let's get one thing straight i like much of snipes' work unlike his other high kicking contemporaries seagal and van damme he can actually act this film however does little to enhance his reputation it's not exactly unwatchable but i am not in any hurry to watch it again either in fact if i never saw it again it wouldn't bother me there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on it's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much over the top violence and very little characterisation br br the biggest problem i have is with snipes' co star silvia it baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful for my money anyway and talented actress like miss and then give her such a pathetic one dimensional character to play with if she was hired to simply add a bit of glamour to the movie she doesn't even do that very well there's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning strange really given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity are we living in 2007 or in 1957 what the producers of this rubbish and probably the actors as well have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring i would love to be chasing terrorists be able to handle myself like mr snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like miss this film satisfies none of those fantasies very well which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review
<START> the problem with making a movie like this though is that the finale the crÃ¨me de la creme of the movie the battle between the two souped up ships must be done well disappointingly this scene in is obviously done completely with little model ships in an overgrown tub there's no tension little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the timeframe is of the stand off br br the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story as all true stories do when converted to a movie such as the union traitor and most notably that of betty stuart madsen a virginia belle br br it resorts to making a possibly decent movie involving an interesting story on the to preaching about the evils of slavery it was out of place in this historical drama and was a cheap ploy to bring in the women viewers it only succeeded in lessening the positives about the film
<START> this is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of i didn't think they made movies like that anymore walter matthau gives his usual over the top performance but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery leaves endearing grease stains he is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone but we still love anyway br br jack lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more golden globe nominations than anyone else 22 he gives a true to life performance of the basically 'good ordinary man' even in the milieu of a farce br br this film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face br br the entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character br br brent spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing he nails the type perfectly his rendition of merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic br br the plot is rather a straight forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated but rather that it is a timeless theme br br the rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them instead of vying for the spotlight in this film even the second tier actors shine it is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film br br the plot may be standard and thin but it allows the performers to shine br br this film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft the plot falls away and the performers shine
<START> if you saw the grudge a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect just worse a lot worse this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot oh and a place with swings cause there's a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them how spooky br br this one is terrible in every way imaginable the acting by the mom and dad don't help matters at all anna paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film br br there is one good moment in the movie however when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out you idiot you have not understood anything lol well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage 0 stars
