<START> this movie is about viola amanda bynes and her quest to beat her school cornwell boys team after they kicked the girls team out so she goes to the rival school and joins the boys team in doing so she falls for duke channing tatum who thinks shes a guy and likes olivia laura ramsey who likes viola as a her brother br br i was in a version of the 12th night play and the beginning was very modern so i knew the play well i was very exited about seeing this movie and when i saw it it exceeded my expectations it kept a lot of my favorite lines and i could see big connections to the play though it was like the play it was not as complicated it was also more of a chick flick than i expected but it was good it was very funny it pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies you saw how viola amanda bynes thought wrongly about what guys thought and her complications in living in a guys world you also see her room mate duke's channing tatum impression of this i really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way it also tells the modern theme follow your dreams but this time it has a twist i think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved soccer and stuck up for herself and her family and her dreams i think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars
<START> jim first real movie is quite a delight but don't come in expecting to see ernest p any time soon i felt the wide array of characters varney depicted were great but without being said the rest of the movie should be put into a or something a rather odd beginning for a movie icon
<START> let me start by saying i don't recall laughing once during this comedy from the opening scene our protagonist solo giovanni ribisi shows himself to be a self absorbed feeble and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook keeping his word or forming a coherent thought i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression i guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature i didn't get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days no spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self absorbed self pitying lowlife i didn't develop any connection with this character he didn't seem to care and so neither did i i actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point br br the dog was not a character in the film it was simply a prop to be used neglected scorned abused coveted and disposed of on a whim so be warned even though dog is in the title this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers br br scott caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend cad don cheadle is sincere and magnetic i always want to see more of him on screen mena suvari was delightfully repellent lynn collins role of a stripper with a heart was well acted but the character was simultaneously absurd and clichÃ©d not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and ribisi br br romantic hardly comedy if you say so
<START> pun intended this low budget action horror vehicle for don wilson's ability to kick things is the stuff direct to video fare is made of br br the plot wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public police chase him vampires chase him he responds by kicking a lot br br there is a little more to the story but it is so inconsequential that i honestly can't remember it i think people actually spoke in the movie but that's up to debate the plot is nothing more than a set up for wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time usually by kicking them br br the technical specs are in a word anemic little color treating amateurish use of lighting simplistic use of camera and angle blood and gore is noticeably limited odd for this type of film the most hurtful of the filming foul ups is the jarring shift to super shaky cam during each and every fight scene if the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed then you know don is about to start kicking everything in sight br br all in all this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor otherwise do not watch unless you really like to watch things get kicked br br 3 10
<START> i've already commented on this film under the name but i see there are others who have commented since all i can say is what the f k i cannot believe that a whole 16 people have commented on this film or even seen this movie add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review seeing as how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet provider just look at their movie although i still admit i got a soft spot for this movie i thought that some of the other people writing about this one might have it confused with another until i read the reviews especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box the ultimate in frontal lobotomy what the f k is that supposed to mean anyway frontal lobotomy i totally forgot about that until i read it in the review people we are a select few i say we meet once a year to view this film wait does anyone still have it if anyone does have it please contact me i'm to get drunk
<START> poor casper van dien his career has slid a long way from tarzan and starship troopers br br in meltdown he's a policeman who just happens to be dating tv reporter stefanie von and her brother is a scientist who's trying to deal with a speeding comment headed for earth but in the runaway comet business even a near miss causes some real problems as the earth's orbit goes out of kilter br br from the survival of the earth we go to the survival of van dien and his immediate family his daughter's gangbanger boyfriend ryan mcdonell actually proves to be of some use especially when he suspects a guy he knows as a crooked cop might mean the van dien group a lot of harm br br my only question here is why didn't they have bruce willis billy bob thornton and the rest of that crew to deal with the nasty comet br br pass this one up folks
<START> for a movie that was the most seen in its native south korea for most of 2004 it was a huge disappointment shows that hollywood is not the only place where people can make over emotional melodramatic movies the film was over 130 minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected the plot was that transparent granted if one himself was korean one would perhaps get into it more but for me it didn't do much anything suffice to say that as the case tends to be with korean cinema the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula south korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination squad from death sentence prisoners to kill kim il sung br br a tedious plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either they are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in korean cinema too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant one dimensional cardboard cuts they should've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are br br one thing it does remind us of is that a lesser of two wrongs is still wrong
<START> taut and organically gripping edward crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle br br in washington dc a company of soldiers cope with their by hanging out in bars three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host sam levene to death because he happens to be jewish police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum who's assigned to ryan's outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has vanished ryan slays the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young closes in br br abetted by a superior script by john paxton draws precise performances from his three starring bobs ryan naturally does his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria grahame gives her first fully fledged rendition of the smart mouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack who's leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable br br the politically engaged perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least there's no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies and br br curiously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it the novel it's based on richard brooks' the brick foxhole dealt with a gay bashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti semitism the studios always at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer br br but while the change from homophobia to anti semitism works in general the specifics don't fit so smoothly the victim's chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there's a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage
<START> despite its many faults 1995 version of gulliver's travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical classic largely because it not only includes all of gulliver's many travels but also includes the satire that's often overlooked unfortunately the twin problems of the book's highly episodic structure and a television budget even a fairly lavish one remain the book is a somewhat rambling collection of tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another but simon moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting the scenes suffer worse here with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces this has to be the only version where we don't see gulliver pulling the fleet behind him br br yet once gulliver makes his escape the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the of a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left the guest prisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source offered immortality with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the that he's not an uncivilized yahoo each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is for the most part it's a darker set of travels than expected with only gulliver's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane it's in these latter scenes that ted gulliver really shines never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race br br being made for television the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down the star cast is certainly impressive and for the most part well used if somewhat briefly in a few cases mary steenburgen james fox peter o'toole edward woodward omar sharif shashi kapoor edward fox ned beatty alfre woodard kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them it's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this
<START> my first review at imdb after a few years of using this site constantly br br anyways saw this on the tube the other night loved it it's in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute but much better was sure for a moment that rex was speedy in waking life but after checking it doesn't seem so br br i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry but i also think these people are close minded admittedly the ending wasn't quite what i was hoping for but overall it was so unique and well acted i can't complain i wouldn't call this cheesy as one reviewer did it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did and they refrained from playing any really 80's music br br can't remember everything that made me smile when i saw this but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity and whether i share rex's beliefs or not i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life and his mutant theory is to my knowledge original he rambled a lot as well but they showed how confused he was at times and why he might have some psychological issues and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them br br also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher usually actors fail at that role he pulled it off brilliantly br br if you enjoyed waking life i say watch this movie if you get a chance br br 9 5 10 br br
<START> the bottom line is if you come looking for a sci fi thriller horror film the matrix is what you'll like if like me you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us then you need to see
<START> i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too like a spoof of his former self and kyra walks around sneering and being miserable the first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba towards the end its pretty bleak in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb reba is being mean to her but poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential
<START> contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope and then when if something is found by sheer chance and lots of luck it has to be analyzed with a microscope br br and after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's rubbish bin for totally useless things one single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined br br cb is campy and intentionally so the usual stuff comic strip dialogue simplistic plot cheerful characters chewing gum pop overacting etc waters knows that he is of making a movie of quality so he hides behind the mask of the intentionally cheesy film maker which supposedly makes him a special kind of anti artist but in the world of cinema being an anti talent often gets mistaken for talent which is exactly what waters had hoped for and eventually got it's a con act charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art it's a plague br br perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring baz to make all those horrible dumb turkeys it's like a virus one waters creates five new bad directors and then these five each create more and so on where will it end with dancer in the dark can that bomb actually be topped
<START> this is my favourite kung fu movie it has a very authentic flavour seasoned by an eerie music score of tradition chinese instruments i think and some wonderfully over acted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy indeed while attempting to create their own western i e cowboy film genre the chinese concocted a whole new animal marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects br br the story of five fingers of death is simple a story of revenge for killing a loved one and the pursuit of the main character to master the iron fist technique that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies there is even a love interest though the awkward polite kind found in most chinese films of the period the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie
<START> this is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007 br br the tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told br br beautifully shot and scripted from childhood to the adulthood it never falters br br a brilliant insight into a lost culture and a very good way to understand farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right it is both compassionate and thrilling uplifting and filled with immense sorrow joyful and depressing br br with excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best br br highest recommendation a real slice of life that and informs
