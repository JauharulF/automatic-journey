<START> movie i have ever seen actually i find it one of the more entertaining episodes of mst 3000 i have seen not that it was good but for anyone who has seen manos the hands of fate knows this one wasn't two bad the monster in the movie looked terrible everyone wore upsetting swim suits and the plot was laughable i still don't have a clue as to why they made the monster they never really gave a good reason the lead female had to be the gal i have ever seen they would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead on the plus side the dolphins acting was great
<START> just saw this film at the fantasy filmfest berlin i am not impressed br br as far as the story goes too girlfriends return from their mexico vacation while waiting for their luggage they get to know a couple of boys who then take the last and of course wrong shuttle bus to the city on board is also one other older man so weirdly portrayed that you instantly guess that he is one of the bad guys the other one is the driver br br the shuttle takes them into industrial wasteland and then one after the other goes done a little blood some cut of extremities some violence mostly playing with the fear of the girls in the end after some ups and downs heres and there's some not too new scary moments everyone is dead but the driver and the girls the girls end up in some garage where one of them is killed after confessing that she had slept with the other girlfriends boyfriend the other girl which is the conclusion is sold by the left over kidnapper yep weirdo got killed in some cargo box to asia a freight harbor being the final picture first story tons of loopholes questions you ask yourself loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation but a total disappointment i can't see how such a unprofessional looser is supposed to have abducted dozens of women as is indicated by a drawer full of drivers aha second acting mediocre at its best br br third scare factor ok but i am bored by torture as a means to nothing but itself trade with humans could be a good reason for a horror flick but it's not used as one just as a background br br fourth music and sound some nice tries but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape warehouse garage and truck sounds have not been really explored music would have been worse without it but apart from that some pseudo moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination ok i guess br br verdict avoid it
<START> i can confidently say that this is the worst film i have ever seen and i usually love foreign films the movie is nothing more than poorly made violent pornography if you choose to see it prepare yourself for endless sexism gratuitous nudity shots and a stupid sensationalized rape scene which i'm sure is the main appeal for the people who like the movie br br additionally the plot meanders aimlessly and none of the characters is likable many scenes are filmed from the woods surrounding the river the girls are on to give a constant feeling that someone is stalking them which was a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of story to tell br br perhaps i wouldn't have wasted my time to see the movie if it had been accurately described in reviews
<START> right up or down there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menace br br the premise sounded cool some of the commercials looked semi promising but alas the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot ness and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot br br if you want amateur writing second rate effects ridiculous costumes and an all around snoozefest by all means watch it the plot is recycled sci fi fodder too bad too because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope it may be the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot br br bottom line don't watch it br br unless of course you liked any of the above 3 movies
<START> first of all i have watched this show since i was a little toddler and i have always loved it sure maybe i didn't understand it when i was that young but i still enjoyed it and now that i have been able to understand it for several years i love it even more the score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score i have ever heard every note is perfect i don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it br br moving on to this particular production this is magnificent of course no one could play mrs lovett besides angela lansbury and she does it perfectly and she should she has been playing this part for several years george is absolutely brilliant the best sweeney todd i have ever heard he has a wonderful voice yet he can throw his voice so well his epiphany is incredible as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it the judge toby antony and are also so wonderful in their roles everyone is perfect well i still have to fast forward through johanna's green finch and bird she just doesn't sing that song well at all br br this show can be appreciated at all ages but it is not always accepted i am not your typical middle aged theater lover i am only 15 years old yet sweeney todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than i have gotten from any other musical
<START> is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in europe this is the european produced pbs series on which the oscar nominated movie traffic is based on if you loved traffic then is a must see br br overall i would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view the screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers traffickers farmers and police officers unlike other movies that sensationalize the issue of drugs presents it as is
<START> i too had waited a long time to see this film as far as i know it has never been released in australia so in the end i found a copy on the net and ordered it through there weeks after my order confirmation it finally arrived and i was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my tv ready to watch a film that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of the world where so many good movies are what a disappointment within the first few minutes i realised i'd ordered a b grader but was still full of expectation i convinced my son 18 to watch it with me as i love sharing when i find a movie of value with good underlying statements and or story lines about half way through he got up and said he couldn't stand watching it any longer it was so predictable and amateurish i agreed but watched to the end the acting was atrocious even for b grade standards the stereotyping also predictable and i feel for the good folks of lake arthur who must've cringed after seeing the film depicting them in such a way no doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world not just the states but really in this day and age i doubt they'd get away with all the ridiculous presented in this i had to double check the date the film was made as their attempts at gimmicky filming of the more gruesome scenes was something i'd expect from a high school student's first attempt at making a film like i'd like to see this film put into the hands of experienced scriptwriters and film makers its an old tale but one that could still pack a punch if dealt with professionally so disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations the soundtrack was probably the only thing i enjoyed
<START> i am from texas and my family a couple of years ago to fe with my brother he suggested we go to see the church with the staircase i was absolutely blown away by the miracles that took place there the movie is great barbara hershey and william petersen were perfect for the parts they played it is amazing absolutely amazing if you have not seen the staircase in person it is worth the trip to go see it the wood is beautiful and the architecture is astounding just being in the chapel gives me goose bumps to read about the history of the chapel and then to see its beauty is breathtaking see the movie it is great then see the staircase in person
<START> i absolutely positively can't believe my fellow imdb reviewers all the praise about how original this movie is it's like they've never seen ring or the million of imitations that's come out in the 10 years since that movie and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs i think not shutter is okay average i'd say i give it 5 out of 10 but there's just no way it's original and great and the most frightening thing i've ever seen as one reviewer said puh people this one is plain it's predictable br br i swear if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them i'm going to scream br br original give me a break you people need to get out more or at least stop calling yourselves horror movie fans
<START> the man from utah opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback this is how we're introduced to john weston john wayne heading into town and looking for work when he helps marshal higgins george pre gabby hayes foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the dalton valley rodeo apparently the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the employ of spike barton ed who also happens to head up the rodeo committee serious challengers to the supremacy of barton's top henchman cheyenne kent yakima canutt wind up severely ill or dead br br even back in these 1930's lone star westerns john wayne had a charismatic presence that hinted at future star quality if for nothing else seeing wayne so young in these films is a real treat the movie itself clips along at a quick fifty three minute pace much of it taken up by stock rodeo footage of and indian parade and dance in the deciding rodeo event weston avoids disaster by discovering a poisoned needle inserted into the saddle of dynamite a formerly bronco on which he must cheyenne br br the ending is no surprise as barton's bad boys forsake winning the rodeo events and go for the whole thirty thousand dollar pot of prize money deposited in the local bank but the marshal and weston are there to foil their plans and save the day for the dalton valley rodeo and as we've seen before in films like the arizona skies and randy rides alone wayne's character closes out the film in a clinch with a pretty young lady this time the judge's daughter marjorie carter polly ann young who for him throughout the film
<START> why does c thomas howell do these movies cruise one time co star does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effort br br where do i start here production values i'll start with the good stuff the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest the set ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad br br script terrible a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie the amount of times the scene faded to black and a second later in the same room was uncountable very poor storyline but so was the cruise wotw takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off br br special fx okay i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruise's lunch bill but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done some shots are quite impressive mainly far off destruction shots of bridges washington liner but in the main the alien machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others br br acting i'm a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low budget flicks he has succumbed to the over acting bug a long time ago look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie there is no comparison he overdoes his facial expressions his flailing arms and legs where did he get that running style and for a final coup de gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family hysterical but after saying all that he is still the best actor on show here busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green zed is truly dead now baby mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene i honestly could not understand one word he said i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene but the dvd did not have subtitles this seems to be a real keep it in the family affair too as son the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film none of them are good br br direction not bad but not good either br br score dismal br br overall a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this he won't have a career soon enough br br 3 10
<START> carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas he's there because of his race and then denigrates it he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also contend he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell he's not the sharpest tool though he is definitely a tool of some sort br br he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers can't put together 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show i can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubt br br if you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe mencia's show is beloved by some of the at least i don't suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic
<START> i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street the sound is really annoying a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one fifth as loud miscellaneous on set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree with dialog taking a distant back seat the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released as large portions of the film don't have any music at all camera work can best be described as a gnarled mess with close up shots where a medium angle would be much better cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads well so be it editing is just a butcher job everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i only made it about three quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore it's like a ninth grade audio visual class project
<START> this movie is a sleeper i've watched every miniseries that was ever on tv some many times and this one is the best wonderfully cast superbly acted and the characters are well developed helen morse perfectly fits the part of jean paget strident in control sharp and a bit belligerent she bounces well off of joe harmon the cowboy taciturn it'll be okay sort of guy i was sorry that the movie didn't stick to the book in that there was no romantic interest between noel and jean paget for those who don't know this is taken from a true story about english women marched around for 3 years by the japanese who indeed did not know what to do with them very few of them survived neville talked to one of them and this is her story this movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves wwii stories
