<START> family guy is easily one of the worst shows i've ever forced myself to watch not at the bottom though i've seen the jersey shore a popular hit with high school and college kids who mistake immaturity for edginess this show is unoriginal and stale br br as this has been dubbed a comedy show let's take a look at its humor 1 random flashbacks cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut to for a knee jerk laugh it got old after the 5 or so repetitions per episode simple solution every time you hear this is worse than like the time plug your ears br br 2 for its own sake this show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot solution watch south park they did it right br br the bottom line is that family guy is not worth your time and doesn't hold a candle to the simpsons
<START> this film is supposed to be about the frustrations of film making it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom the setting is an attractive spanish resort with his usual large cast the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script just all ad lib br br a far superior film about the frustrations of film making is francois truffaut's day for night made in 1973 it shows all the delays and how the cast can in an intriguing manner it doesn't bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film
<START> the gate to hell has opened up under moscow a priest played by vincent gallo goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting i've watched this twice now and i still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms nothing is clear and honestly i didn't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved second billed val kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film the idea is really good the performances are fine the script goes nowhere take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don't cross the river to see this
<START> saratoga trunk is a 1945 film starring ingrid bergman and gary cooper it's based on a 1941 book by the great edna subconsciously she may have had gone with the wind on the brain parts of the story reminded me of gwtw br br set in the 1890s clio is an illegitimate child who returns from new orleans from france with a servant flora robson and a dwarf servant jerry austin she has given herself a countess title and claims to be a widow her mother killed her father by accident and his family shunned her clio takes over the old homestead with the idea of embarrassing her half sister and the wife of her father which she does by calling great attention to herself her plan is to marry someone very wealthy who can give her the security and respectability she craves then she spots clint cooper a texas gambler and falls for him the two have a volatile relationship and he doesn't have any money so she can't marry him so he leaves for saratoga springs eventually the family has enough and their attorney gives her 10 000 to get out of town she does she goes to saratoga springs and goes after the owner of the railroad bart von steed but clint is always around br br bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wearing the period costumes and cooper is drop dead gorgeous with that incredible 300 watt smile of his how she could resist him is beyond me and the love scenes whoa what chemistry the supporting cast is excellent robson and creating interesting characters and florence bates giving an excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who takes clio under her wing knowing she's a big fake br br the film runs a little long and some of the acting may seem old fashioned today but it's an absorbing story filled with atmosphere and vivid performances the ending won't come as any surprise it's a fun journey though
<START> maybe spoilers hard to spoil this thing more then it is but just in case gee's i don't see how anybody could have liked this re make it was like a made for t v show and still pretty lame for that lots of fake snow bad acting by top stars bad action and that crazy pine forest in detroit what the heck i didn't really think this would be a great movie but i was hoping to be entertained nope we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day i could have skipped the rest easy but then i would have missed those great woods i'm so glad i missed this at the theater bad enough to have wasted 3 50 at the video store and i am a lover of cop action and drama films this was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars give me the original any day
<START> this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the clichÃ© aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings the performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic an interesting exploration into family relationships and environments
<START> out of all the films i could have chosen it had to be this when i was last in new york i went into a times square store and out of the hundreds of dvd's they had i chose joel m reeds bloodsucking freaks 1976 and this on a double feature dvd that also included seeds of sin 1968 did i regret it read on to find out the film opens on an island near milligan's staten island home where two lovers are walking along with a massive parasol seemingly made from paper at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift out of nowhere colin hal a retarded hunchback pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all after the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music i have ever heard at least it got me used to it as it's used constantly throughout the film we are introduced to three couples the wives are all sisters vicky ann linden and veronica eileen hayes and bill don williams plus elizabeth carol vogel and donald richard ramos they each receive a letter from a lawyer h dobbs neil that request a meeting so he can read their late father's will dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home house' and fill it with harmony and marital love' that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother he informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal after three days the inheritance will be settled the couples are also told about the servants martha veronica hattie maggie rodgers and the retarded colin who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says 'blessed are the meek for they shall this starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secrets br br co written photographed and directed by the talentless andy milligan this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible lets go through just some of it's faults the music it's awful and headache inducing sound you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes don't have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear milligan shouting out orders to his actors oh and there's a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well the acting probably among the worst i have ever witnessed the very un special effects colin pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence it's the size of a tennis ball the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off photography milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene he regularly cuts the top bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like it's operated by someone who is constantly tripping over there is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen the film is often so dark you can't see whats happening too editing again some of the worst i've ever sat through he seems to cut scenes before they've finished cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence the script if there was one credited to both milligan and hal sherwood it took two people to write this is all over the place and is incredibly stupid there is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement the killer walks right behind him at one point the potential victim turns around what does the killer do to avoid being spotted they duck down right in from of him the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he doesn't notice them right in front of him you have to see this sequence to believe it i still can't believe what i saw bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear check the scene out when richard has to borrow money from his brother walter producer and co writer hal sherwood who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married a strange scene that's there for no reason at all martha the housekeepers reaction to the first murder she's more bothered by the fact that it's thrown her dinner schedule out there's load of insane dialogue as well patty and martha discuss colin patty says if only i didn't beat him so hard martha sympathetically replies you have to patty you have to delivered totally straight faced and don't start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house the only good thing i can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable for the time period it's meant to be set in i could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is but i think you get the idea one to avoid unless your a serious masochist i didn't regret buying or watching it for a second though
<START> the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost horror films from the east has been dismal this film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on e bay or similar br br it is well photographed and the sound is superb viewing on a good screen and with a good 5 1 or dts enabled sound system is recommended obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then i wouldn't bother with this dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here br br it is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences i would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant the ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope the plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way br br if i do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring we have however accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10 10 i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge pleasure from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic
<START> i'm usually not inclined to write reviews about films i don't think deserve a mention but in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic i feel it is important to express my thoughts when i don't like a film queen of the damned is one of those films br br anne rice's popular horror stories of lestat a bisexual vampire first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful an interview with a vampire starring two of hollywood's biggest heavyweights in tom cruise and brad pitt the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience while it may have been a case of style way over substance there was something about it that worked despite its i have never been that enamoured with the vampire genre in general br br since that time brad pitt and tom cruise have gone on to much bigger things it's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel they would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome queen of the damned typifies the type of cr p hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds br br needless to say this film is terrible from the start lestat now played by brit stuart townsend of shooting fish fame awakens from his dark grave to the sound of you guessed it nu metal he freaks out some confused musicians and joins their band under the that he only appear at night what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day br br jesse marguerite moreau a student studying the paranormal vampire studies 101 perhaps tries to find out if lestat really is who he says he is along the way she falls for him something to do with her odd past but has a little competition in queen aaliyah a vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire lestat as her chosen king br br the film is shamefully self yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general watching townsend is enjoyable he knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting the late aaliyah is unfortunately terrible in the title role she has minimal screentime and what she does have she does not use to the fullest the poor makeup and special effects do not help at times she sounds like she's talking through a br br it is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until untimely death last year with the possibility for people to see her final film warner bros put this out to a general release otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible br br no doubt films like this will continue to be made look at the spate of teen rom com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like not another teen movie if there is a market to exploit hollywood will do so br br the biggest issue i have with this film is not the film itself hollywood is about making money so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it that's business but what concerns me the most is that people will actively go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it i guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema is film art first and entertainment second or is it the other way around the only people who can decide that is the audience if you like and are intrigued by good films stay clear of this turkey
<START> let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original lonesome dove than i both the pulitzer prize winning book and the towering mini series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving dramatic believable and engrossing works there is no comparison between lonesome dove and any western film at least not since the legendary collaborations of john ford and john wayne it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new mini series what with non participation and the missing original cast members after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no lonesome dove in almost every way this sequel falls short of the original but so what i wasn't expecting it to measure up taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging entertaining and of a very good quality if it were done as a new story not as a sequel to lonesome dove there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings jon voight did a creditable job as call barbara hershey was a terrific clara and the new characters like gideon walker and vega were well rendered and believable louis gossett jr deserves special mention as the horse wrangler pickett the film made me care about the characters and i don't ask any more than that from an actor it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor it is worth viewing in it's own right
<START> this film is one of my favorite christmas classics sure it's fluff it's not relevant but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing no this movie is definitely a good thing as martha stewart appropriately would say barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her both of them have charm and warmth to spare they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's sydney greenstreet s z cuddles reginald gardiner and una o'connor among them where are characters like this today not one role could have been better cast bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film stanwyck was a strong actress but had the wisdom to play this lightly she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect morgan is the essence of the nice guy because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself but he too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones skip the ill advised and pointless 1992 remake and watch this bright sparkling holiday gift
<START> the only problem with married to the mob is that it is not funny it dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy but almost nothing that happens is funny but if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens then you'll have a really good time it's a glitzy mob film too as per the title extremely glitzy but the director jonathan demme is one of the few prevailing cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in his work from that decade rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970s br br the opening credits combine 1980s animation italian americanism and mise en scene lathered on top of each other at once from there despite it feels about right the lighting by demme's frequent cinematographer tak fujimoto and jukebox soundtrack rife with widely varying pop and alternative jams are gaudy and that is indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere demme is good at colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous composition of a fun mix of styles a plot that could've gone any which way where a smooth fbi agent played by a very bland matthew modine trying to infiltrate a mafia family sees a chance when a gun moll played with come hither allure by michelle pfeiffer tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her trigger man husband in just what you would hope for in an alec baldwin performance is wacked br br the way it goes works for awhile because demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel he knows the significance of showing us the very subjective and relatable life at home scenes with pfeiffer as well as her cares and longings as a morally conflicted mom although her relationship with son joey is taken a bit for granted what mobster's son is listening to party mom when dad's boss played with dean trademark naturalness and by far the scene stealing stand out of the cast is giving him such awesome gifts on the whole though demme's lathered on stylizations are easily viewed as a novel take on a fun crime thriller tale br br ultimately though we find we've been going the wrong way because inevitably modine and pfeiffer have to fall in love that's not inherently bad and every here and there it actually feels bearable but as a romantic subplot it is not handled interestingly or well hardly at all because it across various sundry clichÃ©s which fulfill the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s date flick and for that audience i think it has just the right impact but for someone who has found themselves genuinely interested in the story and the aesthetic approach it is a let down into state of tedium br br so it's a decent movie with huge missteps at certain points but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the '80s perhaps saw a lot of date movies in the '80s the entertainment value is not as likely to except for said deficit in true laughs there maybe a few scoffs and it's very broadly tongue in cheek but i wouldn't leave the comedy aisle with the high hopes with which i'd have initially entered whatever the case anyway there are additional joys in bit roles by great character actors who have by now begun to fade like nancy travis joan cusack and oliver platt
<START> this film could of been a hell of a lot better if they didn't use brian conley as a gangster and if they didn't start the film with christopher br br when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on there were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable the film deserves a 0 but seeing as i there isn't a 0 i gave it a 1 br br i wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy i would rather poke out my eyeballs with some rusty scissors than watch this film again i'm telling you that was an hour and a half of my life i won't get back br br if you want to watch a gangster film don't get this watch going off big time or lock stock and two smoking barrels instead
<START> even for the non opera loving public the name carmen is immediately recognized as an opera by bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men but as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by prosper mÃ©rimÃ©e in has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted spanish director vicente la aka mad love' 'if they tell you i etc incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of carmen from one of her lovers josÃ© provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told br br carmen the amazingly beautiful and talented paz vega works in a cigar factory in seville a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper josÃ© leonardo is stationed carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that carmen is a gypsy carmen murders the co worker and is arrested josÃ© is physically attracted to the voluptuous carmen and when carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape his payback is the promise for a night of passion with carmen carmen keeps her pact providing josÃ© with his first sexual encounter and josÃ© is doomed his lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while but at his release josÃ© encounters carmen again kills a fellow officer and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are people many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers but when real husband is released from prison destructive behaviors take over that include infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of carmen and josÃ© comes to a tragic end br br one factor that makes the story as adapted for the screen by director and joaquim move so well is the role that prosper mÃ©rimÃ©e jay benedict plays his questioning of josÃ© completes the story that bizet's opera only outlines the acting is superb the cinematography by paco and the excellent musical score by josÃ© contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film this is a must for lovers of the opera carmen and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces highly recommended grady harp
<START> much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going battle of the brave tackles the 18th century struggle for the control of quebec an all of canada between the british and the french with sidebars form the new america it has the makings of a sweeping epic of fascination but sadly in the hands of writer pierre whose script deserves a razzie award for worst of the season and the scattered unfocused and confusing direction by jean this film is a dud a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film br br even a cast a fine actors pairing as marie with david la haye as franÃ§ois le adding the lovely bianca gervais as the venerable gÃ©rard depardieu as le thomas and the likes of irÃ¨ne jacob vincent perez ridiculous in period wigs tim roth as william pitt colm meaney as benjamin franklin and jason isaacs as james wolfe doesn't help veteran actors such as these must have cringed at the crude lines written for their characters cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by patrick doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided sad to say such bad things about a costly project but be warned grady harp
