<START> my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian at first i didn't want to watch it but i loved the movie it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime they portrayed the very well it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more not only did it teach but it was a really good movie the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is i think being a would be challenging and very scary it was a great movie all around i would suggest this movie for anyone to see the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up i cried it was very emotional i would give it a 20 if i could
<START> as a recent convert to curb your enthusiasm which prompted my viewing of all season's episodes i expected more much more from jeff's efforts br br when i view a film offering a slice of an average life i need reasons to be interested to care to feel and believe and with jeff at the helm i also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments this film failed me time and again br br jeff plays a living with mom plump sad sack who is a social disaster he has not had a relationships real or even casual for many years he appears to be mostly unemployed and as noted shacks with his mommy dearest can things get worse sure in short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including silverman second city his comedy workshop and his agent all reinforce his 'loser' status silverman's 'fatty' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd his obsession with the role of marty as the means of his career's salvation also hits a big dead end br br while the film's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic ' albeit with occasional golden glimmers was sadly lacking
<START> h o t s is a fun film for a trip back to when skin flicks had a more positive fun filled agenda they were made simply to titillate and have a few laughs everything seems less cynical and jaded the girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates the simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non sanctioned sorority house to get back at the snooty sorority girls who spurned and insulted them instead of the mean spirited tricks of today most of the hijinks are simply innocent fun the women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive to keep our attention between the topless scenes we have mafia henchmen a stolen bear a hot air balloon a funky house mother and the cheapest robot ever seen there's even danny of the partridge family if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment
<START> i had heard about this movie through a friend it was supposed to be a thriller but what i watched wasn't a thriller it was more like a weak attempt at one amber smith was a bright spot that may be giving her too much credit the scenes were she was in bed with actress erika were also lame the two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all amber smith was way out of this gal's league and it definitely showed on camera she did not seem into those scenes at all i was disappointed because a friend of mine guy of course had pumped this movie up to be something great but it was actually more like watching dime store porn
<START> maybe i was to young when i saw it perhaps i have not grown up with grease and elvis movies br br i failed to get it i get black comedy black adder etc i get irony and spoofs i don't get this one though br br i made it a quest to find out the name of this movie enlisting the help of people on usenet and the most excellent imdb message boards so it could be my first 1 pointer awful
<START> total crap br br i was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version i have seen of mansfield park i suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between henry and fanny i snapped and had to turn it off whoever employs this le lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress i've ever seen in my life the whole thing is just bad bad bad i don't know i just don't know why people who write jane austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves
<START> i'm relieved the later reviews have turned sour reading all the positive feedback i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies and life was completely different than everyone else's in the world everything in this movie rang false to me the characters the dialogue the manipulative soundtrack the corny narration all of it as each scene unfolded i kept thinking people don't act like this it's relentlessly heavy handed and maudlin in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it or pretending to like it because it's serious and about real people and confronts issues but man it really did not work for me
<START> as a young lass beautiful joan woodbury as rita adams was orphaned after her stool pigeon father was shot to death as a young woman ms woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job as her murdered father's ex convict status makes woodbury a bad business risk woodbury rooms with understanding linda ware as donna andrews who advises woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends john archer as bob elliott and jack la rue as mickey roman but none of her friends can help when woodbury is the victim of a scam which lands her in prison upon release woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their moneyÂ br br re titled gangs inc this is an obviously weak cheap mobster melodrama still it's a lot of fun to watch woodbury work wonders with inferior material she plays the innocent growing more sophisticated rita quite convincingly and she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized hollywood actresses of the past paper bullets also features an early alan ladd as jimmy kelly aka bill dugan ms ware who sang the hit an apple for the teacher with bing crosby sings a couple of fair '40s numbers nicely but mainly it's show br br paper bullets 1941 phil rosen joan woodbury linda ware alan ladd
<START> ok you people need to settle down this movie is not that bad i saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it i do have to admit that i have never been a fan of leelee sobieski but she grew on me in this movie i do think josh hartnett is good looking but c'mon chris klein is the most gorgeous man i think i have ever seen he made that movie better for me c'mon girls when he has no shirt on and goes to get water i know your mouth dropped yes i know in the beginning he is a jerk but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy if he wouldn't have come at the end then i would have been mad i do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie i definitely recommend it
<START> the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him i think that it is a must see older john wayne film
<START> i like the shepherd sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins the story was average a texas cop battles smugglers this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action van damme was never a good actor i think this movie is better than van last 2 if you're looking for an oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies this movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan
<START> an rko short subject br br a group of rowdy little bullies are given a lesson in tolerance by crooner frank sinatra who compares america to the house i live in br br this little film delivers a pertinent message about the evils of prejudice bias sinatra is an absolute natural in front of the camera intense sincere he is the perfect spokesperson for the values espoused here br br sinatra sings Âthe house i live in ' by lewis allan earl robinson this fine tune with a solid pro american message is being given something of a comeback since the horrendous events of september 11 2001 br br after pearl harbor hollywood went to war totally against the axis not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service but the output of the studios was largely turned to the war effort the newsreels of course brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week the features showcased battle stories or war related themes even the short subjects cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading allied propaganda the boosting of morale or information dissemination together uncle sam the american people hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination
<START> visually this film is interesting light is literally thrown in a way together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles that had my hopes up at the start but then a b movie is a b movie is a b movie no matter how much spectacle is seen this film surrounds the life of albert fish one of the most well known serial killers in the world active around the start of the 20th century life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age this film is based upon two tracks life and that of william f king lead investigator of the case what saves this film from becoming a hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort whenever films about serial killers are concerned is the direction which is a double edged sword director scott l flynn sheds focus enough upon the b actors not to let their flaws shine through too much but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the american police through the king angle sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with meet with grace budd the 10 year old girl that he killed even though i'm not really sure if her mother was the media crazed person that flynn really tries to emphasise that she was i miss more psychological diving into fish not to mention the very little time which was spent on post capture all in all interesting for those who are into serial killers but mostly a let down however if the director will make another film about another serial killer i'd definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched up
<START> possibly the best john travolta role ever saturday night fever was a great movie role but a long time ago i can't think of many of his movies or roles i've even liked and it's easy to think of rotten ones he can do meanies like in pulp fiction but he makes the perfect funky angel and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better equally slobby job with it plot summaries are available everywhere but the plot isn't the point just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little along the way there is nothing to dislike about this movie unless one is searching for something profound i wish there were more movies like this we need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical
<START> when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that i'm a little older i can say that although it's thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention in contrast it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n' slashers of 70s and 80s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham fisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s
