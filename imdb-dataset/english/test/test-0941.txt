<START> much praise has been lavished upon farscape but i don't think it's that good it certainly has a distinctive look but it lacks just about everything else story purpose direction excitement you name it i'm a big sci fi fan and i make it a point to watch all the sci fi shows i can i've almost finished the four seasons of farscape and at this point i'm not very satisfied the show does have a few good things most notably claudia black who's sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four but they are very few and very far between as a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff such as fantasy elements rather than sf ditto and many many episodes esp in season four are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured and one just feels that it isn't going anywhere it's mostly just non directional adventures with thin long running plot lines which develop painstakingly slowly well sometimes it's a little bit tighter but it only lasts for a very few episodes at a time br br effects wise there are a few impressive things here and there esp out in space occasionally but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects which frankly gets old fast outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show a great deal and i've come to prefer by far the episodes where regular human looking characters are the focus br br i think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture despite their all human appearance there are a few really cool episodes with them esp in the first season where crichton masquerades as a captain and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10 but i cannot award the show as a whole more than a 4 rating br br aside from the peacekeepers which themselves are somewhat too single mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced the show simply doesn't offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see otoh it does contain a few good ideas and is not a total loss br br this is just my opinion of course but as a seasoned sci fi fan i think it counts for something and may be of help to others there aren't a lot of good sci fi shows out there but star trek any series and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than farscape but if you're a huge fan of mediocre sci fi shows you may well like farscape too br br my rating 4 out of 10
<START> all in all don't expect much and you won't be disappointed br br and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983 this will do that for sure the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons br br 1 michael caine br br 2 the people the sights the culture and the music of brazil br br the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi believable story even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short br br michael caine is pure class as always besides being a gifted classical and comic actor caine brings a blend of introspection mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfie and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later in this farce he is tenderly beguiling funny and vulnerable melancholy and sentimental and besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment br br well maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason but look is all you can do at michelle though her look seems sorely dated there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her try to act most of her dialogue seems overdubbed too acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her as is into any movie today she doesn't really look much different to be honest ms moore is surely underused especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2 br br save the fact that it is a silly farce at the end i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation that it doesn't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair even with the underage daughter of your best friend could be forgiven and everyone can move on the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired but all works out for the best a bit unrealistic for sure but surprisingly refreshing hope always is
<START> i always thought the batman returns was a great sequel to batman the story was an interesting one and danny devito christopher walken and micheal keaton gave great performances plus lets face it tim burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than joel ever did br br plot oswald cobblepot also know as the penguin played by danny devito is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed he uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of gotham with the help of his goons red triangle gang and a very shady tycoon max played by christopher walken max later makes penguin the mayor of gotham selina kyle michelle pfeiffer is pushed out of a window by max and is revived by cats later on she develops cat like qualities and seeks to destroy max and batman her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained br br opinion batman returns is a classic it has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere tim burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing micheal keaton is still sharp as batman danny devito steals the show as oswald cobblepot the penguin when you think about it he would have made a better violator for the movie spawn than john leguizamo michelle pfeiffer gave catwoman more personality than halle berry ever could max is one of christopher walken's best roles the main reason why i like batman returns is that its fun its not only creative but its also fun something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack the batman series goes to the dogs after tim burton decided to do no more you don't believe me look at batman forever and batman and robin thank god that christopher nolan breathed life back into the series with batman begins
<START> not a terrible film my 10 year old boy loved it and he would be the target demographic so i guess they hit the spot pretty dull for an adult though br br hard to relate to animated lego characters even mod high tech ones br br i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the world was a bit odd unity duty and destiny am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic especially destiny what about freedom equality justice etc br br oh well it will sell lego kind of dull for a movie but not bad for a 74 minute advertisement could have been a lot worse
<START> because mr bean almost never speaks i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause play button at the end of any age group's lesson simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the dvd encouraging students to shout out the answers to what's this what will happen what's happening what's wrong or any other question that elicits responses from that new vocabulary and grammar br br because everyone's looking at the tv normally shy students become vocal because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point it's a perfect filler for the awkward between times while students are leaving and arriving br br i tried other dvds notably tom jerry cartoons and red skelton dvds but no others were as good as mister bean at holding students' constant attention
<START> her bit part as a masseuse in the lurid sequel to the original evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the french soft core series' gambit by inverting the caucasian carnality and casting stunner gemser in a leading role in this the rather tame first of a series of that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in name only sequels br br someone and surely not the english language over warner was also anticipating an 'a star is born' type meteoric rise out the results judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on screen heroine albeit with a couple of sacrificed as insurance against litigation br br gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an photographer allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe trotting adventures but whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of facile i have to confess that since i've been in africa i find white skin less appealing that was to be found in the french films br br and in this particular entry much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism pumping engine as it is in prosaic couplings although naturally these include generous dollops of lesbianism of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights what with such epithets of wisdom as i do nothing to be a perfect black she does everything to be a perfect white
<START> yes it is your typical direct to video action flick and of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal the worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are 1 Â cheap looking villains 2 Â perfectly timed one liners 3 Â intense car chases with massive explosions 4 Â the hero hooking up with the hot chick 5 Â multitudes of nude or scantily clad women for no reason ok so i lied it covers those but does so horribly
<START> i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although i've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway br br i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn br br i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was br br i'll give this film 10 out of 10
<START> bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer this fact becomes apparent in en i where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep yet very emotional scenes this movie is paves the way for bergman's later comedies and all of them starring gunnar as well as eva this is an excellent movie with which to start your bergman experience acutely portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old the cinematography by martin is astounding for instance in the picnic scene in short the movie is a perfect example of a successful comedy with a clarity of depth even surpassing some of bergman's own comedies
<START> on the outside this film is better because of vincent d'onofrio law order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version in some ways the 1999 version is better because it's more up to date a decade as compared to the 27 years the actors in this film were great like terry mcmanus of hbo's oz as james daly and tony shalhoub usa's monk and gary sinise csi ny dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasn't in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the 1982 one character wise vincent d'onofrio playing phil romano was excellent better that paul sorvino it's a match up between stacy keach and terry in terms of james as for george i would praise shalhoub and between martin sheen as tom i would say sinise wins
<START> eaten alive is a little film that opens in new york city and the arctic where tribe men shoot snake venom at a few people then a woman enters the police precinct who's trying to find her sister that has disappeared after 6 months sheila is from alabama but her accent sucks she is teamed up with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say it a lot throughout the film they venture through the amazon only to find a community with people and they find the sister they're confronted by a mad man who has probably seen one too many jim jones preaches he will bring them to a better place it could be heaven but no mark and sheila find out later its actually a suicide cult br br why do i call eaten alive a little film ill tell you but when i watched it i was floored through all the run ins with the cannibals robert has a different role than his professor in cannibal holocaust he's a bit annoying once we meet him at an arm wrestling match that looked like russian roulette we know hes one tough guy plus the strong misogyny just makes you cringe and it looked like i saw it somewhere oh the scenes of animals killing each other but the whole film revolves on those scenes its like were actually watching a images of nature with parts of a film but after watching this film i realized that most of the films scenes are taken from other cannibal films even the demise of 2 of the characters well most of the film is that's why i call this a little film when i did found out that scenes were borrowed i felt like throwing the disc across the room this isn't a film just a simple montage of sorts
<START> whew what can one say about this bizarre stupefying mock u about ed wood's cross dressing fantasies well one word that comes to mind is incoherent wood uses raw slabs of innocuous incidental stock footage and then builds a story around them and what a story wood himself stars as glen a regular joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee's lingerie and sweaters i think what wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the of this world by showing that glen is just like all of us underneath only in angora ummm ok but then we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil a chick in bondage some rude pointing people some moore stock footage and finally an emaciated bela playing some kind of twisted invalid puppetmaster lugosi is a howl spouting out such rubbish as the dragon that at your doorstep he boys tails and snails um ok bela 8 there is a strange twisted type of wood logic going on here afterall he does remind us that 7 out of 10 men wear hats and 7 out of 10 men are bald hmmm must be that alien cross dressing thang glen or glenda stars a plethora whatever that is of reliable wood schlock actors including lyle talbot delores fuller and timothy farrell and wood manages to coax every bit of wretched amateurish non talent out of each one everybody by now knows bela's sad story by the time wood used him for this flic he was probably jonesing for another fix and needed the moolah but even for him this is depth heretofore one of the moocow's favorite wood comes with the stock footage charging buffalo scene it is sooo demented the moocow says de and git yer hooves on a copy of glen or glenda you won't believe it Â
<START> there are so many positive reviews on return to me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie however i feel the need to express my admiration for this unique movie bonnie hunt has proved that she is not only an exceptional actress but also a marvelous director and script writer this movie has everything and is full of humanity tenderness sense of humor don't miss it don't wait any longer and regarding the poor reviews don't pay any attention some viewers forget that this type of movies have to be watched with your heart not only with your eyes if some viewers prefer notting hill or you've got mail that's their mistake for me return to me is a true gem an unforgettable movie
<START> this was made in 2004 for gods sake what happened to our state of the art special effects what happened to our rough around the edges but still good actors the actors in this movie were unbelievably horrible there was one or two that weren't bad but the rest thumbs down couldn't stand listening to the badly written dialogue i mean who the heck wrote that script please don't ever write again special effects don't even get me started on the special effects surely they could have come up with better then fully fake looking green balls of light in the eye sockets it looks so old and lame frankly even the easiest thing to make look real the teeth they looked so fake and stupid i would almost wipe a tear from my eye in annoyance come i cant believe this was even shown to the public
<START> i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn't go down to 10 br br all i can say this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview and it was my worst movie experience ever i don't mind the stupid jokes i can live with the silly story but when i see those dumbly grinning main characters with their pseudo foreign speech only germans will understand what i talk about i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of if they had left them out the thing may actually have been acceptable br br there's not much more to be said about this one you may laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous but that doesn't make it any better it is definitely not funny br br if you live outside of germany be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas br br if you do live in germany avoid this movie at all costs
