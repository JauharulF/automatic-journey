<START> i saw this movie in the rotterdam film festival and i was pleasantly surprised the photography is just so stylish and beautiful and the story it's just not your average mafia movie actually that storyline is pretty much in the background it's more the personal journey of a middle age man that is trapped in an existence he was forced to live the actor toni is superb he excels this quiet man the girl olivia magnani is the grand daughter of italian actress anna magnani and lives up to the family surname br br if you're expecting your typical italian movie where everybody is screaming to each other in big families this is not your movie there are not you're average clichÃ©s and it's definitively worth seeing this one
<START> from the beginning of this film with it's the lost boys rip off opening sequence to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending this movie along at a snail's pace the covenant came highly recommended from some of my co workers who i am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me at least i hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad this movie was not much longer than an hour and a half yet felt much much longer then that the story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes maximum they could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes however someone decided maybe the director but i don't know if anyone really directed this movie that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed artsy camera shots and nonsensical scenes of the boys swimming and getting into bar fights about half way through this film i thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling i had for continuing to watch it so i did bash my head against a wall and i did enjoy it more then the movie i watched it all the way to the bitter end hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment nope my efforts were rewarded with how about i make you my whee i vomited and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel the acting really wasn't as bad as other reviewers seemed to think but even the most talented thespian could not saved this work and work it did on my nerves i give movies a chance even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment and this actually wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen after it was over i did feel like watching the movie stealth again and wow it was so much better this time around oh yeah case in point don't bother with this movie really don't watch a few episodes of charmed and watch the lost boys after having a fair amount of alcohol and you will be a much better person if you do fall into the same trap that i did and watch the covenant make sure to keep all sharp objects far far away from yourself you'll thank me for it
<START> i give this movie a 4 cause i'm a die hard fan of the video game series the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in cg form still cool br br now the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting i've ever seen i've watched epic movie br br the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that clouds mentioned so much that it make you not want to see him in this movie br br the villains have the award for the worst villains ever i was more scared by the wicked witch of the west br br all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a nod to the fans and doesn't take it further then that br br with the chilly br br summary waited 9 years for this movie and this is what i get a large pointless and boring cut scene i beg the head of square to shoot the man responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and any one involved in it and create a new movie from the it would be nice to make the movie in live action and based on the original game
<START> then again i like rachael ray she is fun sweet fresh and such a joy to watch i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarian but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality after all she is a television personality i think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down to earth the studio audience appears to be rather small but that just makes for a environment some people have posted that the show sucks i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years i'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well good luck rachael
<START> this movie is great especially if you enjoy visual arts the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful the story is also both funny and poignant at times br br people who like european films and art movies will like this movie this is truly an art movie it actually has a lot of art in it go rent it br br
<START> rosie perez is the lead in this very engaging affair cast as mercedes a young woman from brooklyn who has resolved to become a film actress although not favoured by her circumstances living in east los angeles and struggling with a series of fruitless auditions for any sort of part at all mercedes has hooked up with a married and washed up actor harry harrelson harvey keitel who at one time had performed in a television western series during the 1970s and seldom since accepting him as her lover in part from loneliness and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his contacts but these latter are of small consequence as harry is simply self delusional in his attempts at recovering what he perceives as past cinematic renown in order to adequately support herself financially mercedes toils as a taxi dancer in a downtown los angeles skid row dance hall bar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from mexico ernesto michael falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections even if they may mean losing her altogether this essentially tradition rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget despite the presence of a goodly number of well known players including steve buscemi anthony quinn and stanley tucci and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather desultory distribution and leaden marketing efforts on its behalf more's the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by alexandre rockwell's admirably controlled direction a consistent virtue of his work and on display in this film from its very opening scene frames that form a montage behind the credits featuring perez at skid fifth and main streets rockwell has often demonstrated that he operates very closely indeed with his cast and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is nicely via the editing process resulting in an artistic success for the director despite negative comments from some mainstream the film's scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by tito who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers acting honours here must go to the ever vital perez although nary a sub par performance is turned in a fair test for any film's quality is given when a viewer will watch it twice within a brief period sitting through this undervalued work will be considered a keen pleasure for many
<START> this is an entertaining surreal road movie it was written by joseph minion who also wrote after hours martin scorsese's excellent surreal film the film follows the adventures of a ten year old kid named gus who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like a tribute to luis film perhaps essex south lyndon in search of eight elusive game cards from various chimera company gas stations the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual like the money for instance which is like blank paper with numbers on br br most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip they tattoo him punch him but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance meat loaf flea also make appearances jack nance plays a motel owner who when he first meets gus tells him if you see any squirrels give them to me this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus 100 and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies you'll like this an odd little gem of a movie
<START> first of all i have to say that i'm a huge lucio fulci and dario argento fan although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies i really enjoyed almost every one i did see i really like giallos and i thought argento was the master of this genre after seeing films like tenebre and phenomena but after i saw new york ripper by fulci i found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo argento on a certain level br br i love fulci's style and yes i love gore but this film i think although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films is not his best one what i don't like is that it can be confusing at times especially at the end and the fact that we go from one suspect to another and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment i think it goes too far i know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end and the killer should be very hard to find but this film plays a little too much with our minds however i did like the scene when the witch is killed i think it is very well done and gave me the chills the acting is also pretty good and the photography is great br br although this is not a bad film i think lucio fulci has made better films than this and i think his best one is the beyond a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience br br i give don't torture a duckling a 7 out of 10 br br
<START> i found this movie really hard to sit through my attention kept wandering off the tv as far as romantic movies go this one is the worst i've seen don't bother with it
<START> being a freshman in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom of course my situation doesn't with natalie portman and situation but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights there is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be i was balling my eyes at the end of this movie reaction of her daughter going to the east coast miles away after all they've been through reminded me of how i felt being from a small city in the west coast going to new york br br the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up it is very touching i was moved by the movie every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didn't get any phony sentimentality i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything this movie is a bit corny of course but everything is trully momentous its all about what a mom can learn from her child and what a child learns from her mother 8 10
<START> the many other comments about the film say it all just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema and it got an overall average score of 8 6 we'd 100 recommend it then for today's audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience did br br the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding of course finney and were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast for our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non use of camera and sound was a great influence br br how delightful many said to see a really great film that's british still not dated twenty years on not full filled with blood guts not confusing because of bob about all over the place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines no seedy sex scenes such views were even uttered by some who were younger
<START> out of boredom and vast curiosity i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like the show was pretty bad br br first of all the show just wasn't funny the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying especially since none of the jokes were funny the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who's the cameraman said i'm going to go polish my lense how the hell is that funny the parts in it like meat drumming that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who's over the age of eleven br br now i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience however since i have a four year old niece who watches it this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it it doesn't show very good behavior in the episode i was watching it shows sam stealing sandwich and pushing her down to the ground just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her i would not want to see my niece acting that rude i also don't like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information if this was real there would be freaks all over her br br this show would probably be good and funny to someone who's eleven or younger but anyone older than that just stay away from it i'll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid
<START> ohhhh man this movie is awful br br this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name or no name well to be fair i guess most canadian movies give canadian cinema a bad name br br next to the characters there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie it's like a drunken snail making its way to die br br thank goodness melanie is nice to look at she's the only thing that kept me watching unfortunately the rest of the movie kept interrupting br br good for a laugh though if you're having a bad canadian movie night though br br did i mention melanie the only good point too bad they didn't have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a time br br another addition in the canadian hall of stinking movies
<START> i channel surfed past this many times mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy so love american style however it turned out to be quite good very well done the two stand out features are the dialog and acting great cast the premise is actually well executed and there aren't too many weak moments i guess what i was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart and instead the cart just banks the turns so to speak and the movie keeps flying there are some nice little sub plots particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former conan sidekick andy richter also want to mention that the music accompanying it was good
<START> www petitiononline com petition html an excellent tv series that should be captured on dvd this was a show i rarely missed i found a petition to bring it back on dvd i recall one show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer subway security branch the accountant wanted to shut down the funding for the project as it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark www petitiononline com petition html
