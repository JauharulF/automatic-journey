<START> how truly sad that this sprung from the same mind as donnie darko possibly one of the best films in this genre where do i even begin i think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity and yet we see no humanity in the film no more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human these are horrible one dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings sadly that's how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting is this truly how kelly sees humanity judging from the reaction of viewers this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity why don't the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have this is not an indictment of humanity it's an indictment of the straw men that kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situation br br to those who say this was a wonderful thought provoking film to what are you comparing it armageddon i even saw someone compare this to the works of kurosawa how truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion for the love of all that's good in film even indecent proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is there we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition yes even indecent proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5 3 vs 6 0 for this mindless tripe br br rarely have i seen a more pretentious pontificating and self aggrandizing film fall so flatly on its face this has the depth of a high school film project and a poor one at that truly that's about the level of the discussion promoted by this film if you want to see good psychological film making do yourself a favor and check out das experiment if the box had lived up even to this one goal i would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting gaping plot holes and sheer nonsensical storyline sadly it can't even do that br br the true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition this is not sartre this is not even the cliff notes version of sartre this is a hastily conceived and hack written 9th grade term paper on sartre based on some internet message board ramblings if sartre were alive he would sue kelly for defamation
<START> the storyline of this movie is clichÃ© and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park the filmmakers didn't even try to hide that it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur dolls so instead the viewer sees some robot like toy dinos from a cheap which move in a very unnatural way it's funny though because it's so bad the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are no one seems really excited to be in this movie which i totally understand especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep the one positive comment note i'd like to make about raptor is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes
<START> on the cusp of being insufferable somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit this movie is poor and what's more it's a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southern literature professors out there travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood sorry pal you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in ulee's gold if you want the against type brave anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just pout on screen stop this director before he she name is vague on gender directs again
<START> seriously reality charity tv these producers must think that the masses are full of non thinkers br br these shows are called reality which means they are suppose to resemble something real with truth or facts br br i suppose the characters are really acting in all the pathetic ness br br at one point i wonder if these type of shows decrease or increase the collective unconsciousness br br we live in a world that already contains individuals that are not authentic br br is it necessary to promote an inauthentic way of being
<START> i am very into waverly hills and first watched death tunnel the movie couldn't have been much worse then i heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effects wrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should be waverly hills doesn't need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is tours are 20 00 per person and 100 00 for 8 hour overnight investigation per person minimal group of 10 for overnight investigation tours must be set up ahead of time awesome place for the ghost hunter
<START> directed by luis bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in mexico as written by the director and julio alejandro his notable collaborator this was a film that put mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the grand prix in cannes that year it's a disturbing film because mr bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church br br by all reckoning is a saint this young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city he doesn't have enough for himself but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help at the same time he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building is seen taking to the countryside begging for food and beatriz two prostitutes from his old town follow him life parallels that of jesus in fact this saintly figure makes a case for humility br br of course mr bunuel had no religion in mind when he and mr alejandro took it upon themselves to create this film it's ironic how spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing christian qualities when in reality this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers br br francisco the spanish actor makes a wonderful this was one of his best roles mr worked extensively in his native country but also in mexico and argentina rita as is also excellent lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of beatriz br br a great film by one of the cinema's master film makers luis bunuel
<START> arthur miller has always been known as one of america's great playwrights for works such as death of a salesman and the crucible focus is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen however knowing what a great playwright arthur miller is i doubt that his original play was very much like the movie the movie comes across as empty and formulaic with william h macy as a non jew mistaken for a jew by anti semitic neighbors in wwii brooklyn don't get me wrong the acting is ok and i presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism but the movie just doesn't work macy laura dern and david paymer just can't create an effective story with the material here
<START> there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway br br i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream like quality it has in other words the plot isn't structured like other films with the case of mulholland dr it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who until the last second to do his art project it doesn't make sense it isn't supposed to but i know it was to be a tv series at first it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff you will notice that toward the end the nudity sex and foul language increase all things he would not have filmed for television br br for a better film not told in a traditional linear fashion rent the thin red line from 1998 that was a great film this is not br br rating 2 out of ten
<START> aaron raises the same questions as shakespeare did or does how could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life here like in the west wing opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives a puffy tom hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and julia roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines the subject is serious but the treatment is light intelligent but light philip seymour hoffman as the invisible middle man steals every scene he is in just like charles laughton did in every movie he was in the dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy the seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the mike collection
<START> dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard she traps him into bringing her back with him br br glynis johns in the title role is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out br br margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here in fact miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts br br nice to see david tomlinson in the film he would get together with johns in the far superior mary poppins 16 years later br br miranda causes mischief in that two guys a neighbor's fiancÃ©e and chauffeur tomlinson fall for her br br ask any mermaid you happen to see what's the best tuna chicken of the sea as for this film forget it
<START> the emperor's new groove was a great twist for disney it wasn't a musical it had clean fresh jokes and no political twists it was just a darn funny movie br br new groove on the other hand is tired and weak my 3 year old still loves emperor's new groove but fell asleep during there really isn't any really conflict that in the first movie lead to all of the wacky adventures because of the lack of conflict it almost seems like the animators threw out the writers and just made the storyline up as they went along br br i kept waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun and still am
<START> i saw this television version of a christie mystery story when it was shown back on channel 5 in new york city in 1980 at the time i was surprised it was not shown on channel 13 the public television station that showed most of the masterpiece theater programs but aside from some dorothy sayers lord peter wimsey stores and the the bbc productions rarely dealt with british detective stories another series the rivals of sherlock holmes had dealt with stories set in the victorian and edwardian period so a period charm was involved in getting those stories onto channel 13 br br the plot of why didn't they ask evans dealt with a young couple stumbling upon a dying man who's only last words are the question of the title of the story the novel was originally called why didn't they ask evans but subsequently was retitled the boomerang clue the young couple start investigating the murder and trace the crime to a set of people who surround a questionable doctor eric porter despite the warnings of the father of the hero john gielgud the hero james warwick and the heroine francesca annis pursue their investigation even as it gets murkier and more dangerous the death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers as the killer starts looking into silencing the two amateur detectives br br it's not a bad film although i agree it was a bit too long for a single night's entertainment if it had been done like later miss marple episodes with joan or the hercule poirot episodes in two parts it would have been better but it has it's strengths one is the proper use of porter as chief suspect and a clever scene later in the film where he appears to be spying on the young couple who are investigating the mystery if you stick to the film you will be in for a fair surprise later on br br but it has one failing when dealing with a christie novel the figures in the story have to be in a rigid schedule of movements so that the reader might be able to figure out what the secret of the plot is i will only add that if you hear the dialog at one point and how a little boy was almost killed but wasn't then you will find all the parts of the story coming together and what the villain's motivations were br br except for that and the lengthy time the telefilm takes to tell it's story it is quite a good film and worthy as one of the best programs based on a christie story in the period when their was a sudden renaissance in films based on her novels
<START> i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is little things like the lights create a true uneasy feeling the shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films anything could happen in the film the acting is by no means perfect nor were they bad the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her in the end i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects br br it is definitely a film i would recommend
<START> christopher nolan's first film is a 'no budget' black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers which in turn leads to robbery and also violence it is very good br br like in his later film he doesn't present the story in a linear way instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early apparently random shots take on significance as the film progresses this style also means the twists are much more effective br br definitely worth seeing if you get the chance especially if you like his later work and or film noir
<START> through its 2 hour running length crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10 odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in american society that and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days br br the era we live in has become so complicated not only do we reject modernism even the not very enthusiastic flag waving of post modernism ideas is always being shot down by what post post modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas all in no part thanks to the great ideas of those great but i digress this has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about but rather what the movie is br br sure it seems hard to earn a living in a hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post post post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life it has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not and so a new studio product is born indie films which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as hollywood films to sell to indie film markets an indie film must sell at sundance before becoming and so nothing is simple anymore even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are borne filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost films have to make people think have to be meaningful has to be provocative raise questions yadda yadda yadda what it all boils down to is a subversion of the hollywood movie system but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of hollywood films the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same product br br and i haven't even begun on the film yet maybe i've become too picky on films i see these days maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained rather than say be when seeing a movie but hell this movie is one big load of crap and i'm repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the how to make a good movie good 101 to the t characters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like they're gifted with the speech of god it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in america it has moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages you know you're in for all of the above traits br br and something about the aforementioned point about it raising questions about immediately compelling issues like racism pisses me off big time like all post post post post post everything movies it doesn't contend with just having a message about this issue because oh our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post post post post world our audiences want us to make them think doesn't want us to put things so simplistically and then they will go into existentialist crap and say that's because life itself isn't simplistic ha ha ha what other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them okay okay and okay so the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non messages and since they're not exactly a message it's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right so we're being hit again and again with this well written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose and as if the irony is not steep enough we have character the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously being into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to something about themselves too' um yeah how i wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man br br to cut the long bullshit short i guess i wouldn't have taken issue with the film if it wasn't so bloated in its self importance the angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white boy whining than actual spike lee ish anger it's so tim robbins and sean penn the type that wants to wave flags about when the only thing they don't realize is the flag they're waving is their hole ridden underwear plus it's become so trendy in the post post post post world to be completely subtle about it nothing is simple any longer in its best efforts to actually be good provocative and ultimately human it's become neither imho just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie filmmaker now at least hollywood is more simple and sincere in its
