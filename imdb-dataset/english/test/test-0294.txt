<START> it was dumb sort of like an adam sandler movie br br there were a few funny parts but not that funny br br i liked some of the actors in it though br br there were some sat night live people in the movie but i wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie
<START> i have seen chasing the dragon several times and have enjoyed it each time the acting was superb this movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life
<START> the quality you're likely to remember after viewing the big knife is how claustrophobic it is it's pacing is sacrificed to a uniform texture of dialog it's talky in the extreme modern viewers will feel every point has been made and then some but the movie will still not move on or do the viewer a favor and change the scenery it's very inert at the 45 min mark i was sure i had watched two very slow hours my beleaguered response was good god where is this going it feels like odets was paid by the word br br this is a good place to note the decline of drama from it's high point in the 40s through the conceit laden projects of the 50s and 60s until actual filmic merit was rediscovered in the 70s only to vanish again here we get show offy conventional emotional outbursts from steiger lupino et al and camera moves pre arranged to meet over practiced blocking this is due to the rise of the method the regrettable trend of sacrificing every other merit of film to grant actors their most selfish wishes great acting ho hum has killed thought in movies br br jack palance's forehead pompadour retract and thrust forward every time he reacts to something it's disturbing br br this is awfully boring stuff
<START> francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her we learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late she's also recently learned she's pregnant which has further complicated her heart she doesn't want to be a complacent despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone she meets two men on her journey a former college football hero who after an accident during a game has been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life the clear clean landscapes as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler are astutely realized as are the characters shirley knight james caan and robert duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms some scenes such as knight's first call home from a pay phone or her first night alone with caan where they play are almost too intimate to watch coppola toys with reality turning the jagged memories of his characters into we've been made privy to he allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy there are at least two or three very frisky moments it's a heady endeavor so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later some may shun coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings from
<START> bad plot bad acting bad direction br br it had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything br br this film looks like someone started with an idea googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music br br others had to stop watching because they were scared 2 3 of the way through i had to take a break purely because i just didn't care anymore br br reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with marginally more suspense br br just bad
<START> pistol packing pam grier takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in asylum of satan director william entertaining blaxploitation actioneer sheba baby co starring martin and austin stoker sheba baby is one of several tough chick flicks that grier appeared in during the 1970s including coffy foxy brown and friday foster the short lived co wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer david shelton in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business unfortunately sheba baby isn't nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that grier made under the supervision of director jack hill hill helmed the african american north carolina native in coffy foxy brown the big bird cage and the big doll house anybody that analyzes images of african american women in cinema should be familiar with these epics the chief problem with sheba baby is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks naturally the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldn't hit the side of a barn with a as the main antagonist dick qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like anything worth having is worth stealing additionally composer monk huggins does provide a strong atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the best song with barbara mason warbling it is good man is gone sheba baby casts grier as stylist chicago gumshoe sheba shayne she leaves the windy city to return to her hometown of louisville kentucky to help out her father when she arrives in louisville sheba learns that her father andy rudy challenger of detroit 9000 is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed pilot cigar chomping martin of hammer who demands that andy sell out his loan company to pilot or die br br initially pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash andy's office but our heroine's father catches them in the act they turn sheba's father into a punching bag interestingly during the fight scene rarely shows fists smashing flesh earlier andy's right hand man brick williams austin stoker of horror high had sent sheba a telegram requesting that she return to louisville but she didn't receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn't know where to find her brick and sheba hook up rekindle their romantic flames and share a night in the sack brick spends most of his time urging sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity as a former louisville kentucky police woman sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second after she arrives home sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes being blown to bits as she is walking out the door to get into her father's car andy receives another harassing call from pilot previously andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to pilot but andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum a gratified pilot warns andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse in other words cranking up the car won't trigger the explosion the explosion comes ten seconds later andy and brick rescue sheba before the car blows up earlier sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference dad i know you think i'm doing a man's job but i'm not going to sit on the sidelines just because i'm a woman sheba tells him after her near death experience sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her father's car she an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information only after sheba has ground the guy's face into a bucket of dust does he and tell her about a pay off at the town's railroad museum brick accompanies sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered pilot getting away by the skin of his chin br br later pilot sends a quintet of out of town contract thugs armed to the teeth to trash andy's office these gunsels ignore their no kill orders not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons but they also blast sheba's dad with a shotgun sheba retaliates in short order wielding her nickel plated revolver she guns down three of the four assailants dirty harry style the last hit man discards his weapon and pleads for mercy sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective phil jackson charles kissinger of abby and a uniform cop arrive on the scene at the hospital andy shayne dies holding his daughter's hand naturally pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy afterward sheba tracks down a loan shark walker christopher joy of cleopatra jones and information out of him about the pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash this is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming walker warns pilot about sheba pilot and his henchmen confront sheba in a parking lot and swap lead sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival while the police corner one of pilot's men she deals with the others pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and sheba runs him down she pins pilot to a roller coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller coaster cuts his head off pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man shark dick of the whose reputation is so immaculate that detective jackson describes him as the guy with all the right answers sheba baby isn't top notch pam grier however the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick
<START> this is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual hollywood tripe it really is a roller coaster ride as we follow the effects of a a forged 500 euro note on a multitude of people one asks 'what if' all the time but it certainly is a butterfly effect captured on film it'll have you laughing crying and biting your lip i loved every minute of it and thank you sbs australia for showing films that are truly entertaining even worth the effort to read the subtitles the only downside to my mind is that i wont be booking a holiday to the frozen land they all seem to be far too depressed must be all that cold weather either way watch it it's worth every second
<START> pretentious claptrap updating herman melville about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by gypsies or something like that Â not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes pseudo symbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve who at least gets to bathe in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently there's an even longer tv version of x out thereÂ
<START> contains 1 spoiler market with br br not presenting itself as yet another remake of the interview five fingers actually is alas besides maybe the hardship of physical torture it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense plot or performances in fact five fingers never gets anywhere near its level br br what i found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself but the way ryan philippe acted out his ordeal to me it looked as if philippe tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great colm meaney accent btw being far from anything near dutch sounded more like eastern european br br besides the acting of which to my surprise turned from poor to actually decent towards the end there is the matter of the flashbacks with the hackneyed dutch scenery if these scenes were set in switzerland they would have had the cast eat cheese on with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive scenery aside the way these flashbacks pushed the plot didn't work for me at all it made it being served like french fries at a drive in and caused the build up of suspense to br br admittedly the movie did become more enjoyable as acting improved but i couldn't help being annoyed every now and then with scenes that were just too implausible e g br br start spoiler br br at some point after days philippe is almost tenderly washed by the female terrorist this only to be followed by the brute severing of yet another finger why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture and the severing of that last finger seemed to only serve the title of this flick anyway i mean he was practically begging to have it knifed off didn't make br br end spoiler br br what ultimately kept me watching was the performance of fishburn who once again proved to be a brilliant actor but who also had the best part of the script to work with br br all in all one is just far better off seeing the interview with that other matrix icon hugo weaving and when you do i'm confident you won't find this review that disagreeable br br 3 5 10 br br the interview 1998 www imdb com title
<START> like many this dung heap caught my eye while i was channel surfing it's a horror film set in the woods it has a stupid title but hey michael rooker is in it and he has been a part of some great horror flicks i know he wouldn't steer me wrong ugh the most insulting part of this is that i actually watched it i see director johnny martin is a stuntman well this stunt simply sucks and how he got some of the actors to do this watery bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all i can understand casper van dien but shame on you mr rooker your good name in the horror community has been forever tarnished and your agent should be fired immediately i'm sure this nugget of fecal matter is available on dvd but if you enjoy the 99 cent menu at mcdonalds you'd get more for your money there
<START> its a very sensitive portrayal of life with or constrained desires what does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms one husband finds outlet with the immigrant since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted they don't need to conform and dam their desires the other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness it fails of course and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires the mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth she sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband br br but the final act of rejection was by the grandmother she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept desire a decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture br br seems like it was easiest for the to let his desires flow since he's anyway damned by his culture being at the bottom of the hierarchy since there is anyway no respect and expectations might as well taste sin
<START> league of gentleman has been the most disturbing british sitcom to be on t v and how can a funny movie be so bad rated they just have no taste this film will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny br br it is surprising that it has done bad but it is british the cinema do crap most of the time but this time it in my words a boost with comedy with a giraffe over lady's this is a top british comedy and better than dodge ball so by this and it won't prove you wrong as i don't really laugh through films but this film was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed of how much edward and were in there for back to typing buy this film and it won't disappoint you
<START> someone says this anime could be offensive for girls not really embarrassing situations are funny first time i see this series i was in the video store people around me started laughing doesn't matter the age or gender a teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car during the last moments of the series the same car appears episodes had a touching and funny ending specially last one i don't regret to buy these series

<START> there has been a political documentary of recent vintage called why we fight which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during world war two by hollywood director frank capra although considered documentaries and having won oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes that said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries such as the bbc's lauded the world at war lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable they are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series br br rarely has something free been so worth invaluable while there are no extras on the dvds and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic warner brothers pro war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts the seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are prelude to war the nazis strike divide and conquer the battle of britain the battle of russia the battle of china and war comes to america br br overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars the lesson of world war one avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to world war two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since korea vietnam nor iraq the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information clogged times it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last
