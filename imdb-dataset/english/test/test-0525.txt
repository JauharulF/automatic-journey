<START> rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title and realizing that i had rented it some time before br br quick plot line a couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe estevez still cursing the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act they find a bed in a forgotten room but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the 1930's and his last victim their ghosts inhabit the couple first enhancing their sex life but eventually becoming more menacing br br what ensues is cheap r rated sex scenes cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time
<START> here's another pleasant surprise whenever i hear a movie is being remade i cringe movies such as gone in sixty seconds and the day of the get remade and the results are less than stellar so when i heard that the italian job was getting remade i expected it to be bad br br well i had the opportunity to calm down read some reviews and finally see the movie and was proven wrong granted it's not original and predictable but it's sure fun from beginning to end you are taken on one very fun ride the scenes with the minis are great and the characters actually enjoy themselves br br so even if there are some flaws who cares as long as it's fun br br overall 8 out of 10 the only points lost are maybe the a few details and a slight lack of realism but you'll be having so much fun you won't even be given a chance to stop and notice
<START> before you dismiss my post as not getting it let me say i'm one of the biggest richard kelly and the twilight zone fans out there donnie darko is one my all time favorites and i even thought tales had it's moments i'm a huge sci fi fan i was very excited to see the box couldn't wait for it to come out br br having said that the box is terrible behind drag me to hell this was the worst movie i've seen in 2009 and it just simply will not end whenever you think you've reached the end another change in the plot and you're off to more torture i was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film i could hardly take it anymore br br the biggest problem with the box no matter how you slice it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense trust me i got it i understood what was going on but that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it take the basics for example the main couple cameron diaz and james marsden playing norma and arthur lewis diaz loses her finances at her job then bemoans to her husband that they are living paycheck to paycheck well sell that f ing porsche your husband is driving then they live in a beautiful 2 story house in a nice subdivision marsden is working what seems to be a high paid job at nasa and diaz is an accomplished teacher and yes marsden drives an overly expensive car but they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck no need to press the button just cut down your high priced lifestyle a bit the movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt instead they are seemingly desperate for money all the while living what i would call a luxurious lifestyle like i said you can understand what's going on yet it still makes little sense that's a rare combination br br there was an awful scene in a library that i feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history terribly acted too by the way it was idiotic illogical and out of place i can't even begin to fully describe it actually so i will move onto a subplot that involves nose bleeds and body possession by aliens yes i'm being serious unfortunately a kid is in diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school he starts asking diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class no punishment is given to the kid whatsoever he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk then diaz is at a party and the same kid is one of the hired help ironed shirt apron and all i don't know many alien possessed kids who appear to be in junior high that also moonlight as a bus boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials but we found one here see what i mean you can understand it completely but it still makes no sense a rare combo like many things in the movie the kid comes and goes no real explanation about him no ending to his character moving on a lady then approaches diaz in a grocery store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects well hmmm if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely and the aliens don't want to help diaz then who was taking over this lady's body and giving diaz advice again the lady was trying to help diaz and the aliens weren't interested in helping diaz so who the hell was controlling her body never explained never talked about again no nothing it goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks it would not end i wonder if this movie underwent a massive re shoot at some point it was poorly edited diaz's accent was there one minute gone the next sub plots began but never ended the numerous push backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product it's truly a train wreck br br pass on this one there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever 3 out of 10 just because i like diaz and sci fi but it probably deserves a 1 out of 10 br br thanks for reading br br jd
<START> br br i thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had this is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week the original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel one good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly because the plot seemed rushed when rachel's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie another bring down was the involvement of amy irving all her scenes brought down the movies pace the dialog in this movie was terrible it in no way reflected the way kids talk in conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene
<START> this is a truly great and beautiful movie the underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child heather graham as struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being incessantly beaten down by the real world it's not an unhappy movie though exactly the opposite it's a funny movie with a sad side but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy near the beginning of the movie beautiful vulnerable confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friend's car she reasons with him convinces him to seek help and gives him 30 as a start at the end of the movie he reappears to pay her back explains that he is off drugs doing well and he thanks her i can hear the cynics groaning of course that would never really happen this movie doesn't take place in the real world it takes place in the world we wished we lived in the sad part is realizing we don't live there the happy part is knowing there are people wishing we did
<START> i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking but was i wrong this film was boring especially in the beginning and the middle parts i cannot comment on the ending because i just couldn't stand watching the whole film the premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense this student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film so if you are having trouble with sleep then i recommend that you rent this film
<START> i watched on movie theater at my city my friend took away me and i was really curious what would be it looked like well i must say this movie was not a horror may be we can say that is ok here i go anyway but there was a lot of shooting acting dramatic theatrical and storytelling problems i can understand because of director is very young and is his first feature film ok directing of this film was not pretty bad i see unfortunately due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget the visuals are often as murky as the storyline and there is no powerful gothic scenes as a horror movie it really fails no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring some people say is an art movie but i could not see a laughable terrible and off art movie like that so how can we say it is an art movie just funny
<START> i had high hopes when i went into the theatre having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premise br br however it's disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songs the words are chunky and cheesy probably because it was composed with a more western theme i wouldn't find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with french or english lyrics in mandarin they just sound strange br br the musical items were also cut together badly far too quickly to be enjoyable and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too long br br the special effects are the next disappointment suffice it to say it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stop br br it's not moulin rouge and it's not in the mood either inspite of the occasional and very similar slow waltz theme altogether and hour too long to tell a simple story
<START> i was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan you'll love this i used to dislike horror movies considered them stupid but anyway it happens i make exceptions i find something really extraordinary in this film rarely have i ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but i tell you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters i highly recommend this film and i'm glad that asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days br br i recommend enjoy
<START> mike nichols' film charlie wilson's war set in the 1980's tells the story of how the title character played by tom hanks managed to wage a covert war with the russkies by way of aiding the afghan forces of course we know how well that turned out in the long run but thankfully the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after effects br br the cast is star studded with tom hanks and julia roberts being among the most bankable stars in hollywood as a bonus you've got the versatile philip seymour hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role one for which he received a not unwarranted oscar nomination i'm not much of a fan of roberts but hanks is always dependable nevertheless i can't quite buy into him as a drug using womanizer although the real charlie wilson seems just as eminently likable as hanks apart from the big three though there's not much worth remarking on even from a recognizable name like amy adams br br the story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from aaron the verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines the later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended on the whole nichols' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably br br this is a film that like charlie wilson himself has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light hearted feel
<START> alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels i was a huge fan of margaret book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money br br although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton this is a really terrible film the script is horrible and full of clichÃ©s ann cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her br br the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy feral villain lord fenton sean bean's performance is along the lines of the man you love to hate and portrays an unsafe sex symbol br br but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script br br don't waste your money on this film unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance
<START> the regard of flight written and performed by bill irwin is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen full of quick and sparkling dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade it is head and shoulders above 99 of comedy as it is presented today i am sure it will one day take its rightful place with such great shows as the and waiting for godot why it isn't available on dvd yet is a mystery and a tragedy
<START> if you see the title a sex odyssey in the video store beware the cover has tori wells and three other 80's porn stars and has a copyright of 1986 if you're like me and i hope you're not you'll think 80's porn tori wells alright trickery it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars there's nothing inherently wrong with 70's german porn but it's not my cup of tea and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket i watched it anyway it's a bad bad movie sorry i guess i didn't really get past the rage
<START> shot entirely on location in bulgaria the man with the screaming brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly american types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy br br william cole and his wife jackie arrive in bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler things start to go awry when the maid murders and william and a mad scientist implants a piece of brain in william's head robots eventually become involved as do gypsies with broken fingers head injuries bruce campbell riding a pink vespa with prissy little streamers and all of me style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body br br the man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny film it has the most hilarious tracking shot i have ever seen when bruce campbell's character fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas runs into a square and scares a crowd of people and a falling down the steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing the whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and i would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy bruce campbell or b movies in general
<START> i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other they may have faults but bitterness and put downs have no place with these girls try to find that on tv or in the usual movies it is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine wearing beautiful feminine dresses and shoes contrast that with the apparel in stores today i e raggedy and faded jeans and jackets etc the story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting i know that it is animated but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay i would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike
