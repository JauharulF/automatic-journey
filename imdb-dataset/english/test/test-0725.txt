<START> i recently watched this film on the sundance channel and it kept me interested from the start however it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end i felt somewhat cheated in a nutshell noble willingham of walker texas ranger fame plays a boat salesman who starts getting harassed by telephone from a man claiming to be his son according to the mysterious caller willingham has a dark dirty little secret that affects the son and he the son is enjoying reminding him of it i won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this movie a great deal one the movie has more foul language than goodfellas scarface casino and glengarry glen ross combined 99 of it is spewed from willingham himself it didn't take long to wear me out with constant four letter words two i simply could not believe that anyone would answer the telephone that many times especially when one knows that a crank caller is on the other end of the line no matter where willingham is in the movie whether it be at work home a diner etc the phone rings and he always answers it spewing venom at the son and then hanging up only to answer it again when the caller calls back in about ten seconds how many of us would do that now i realize that we probably do not have a movie if he doesn't keep answering but i just could not suspend disbelief on that particular matter three and this is the most minor of the criticisms why is the director so opposed to showing us the man a k a the caller son most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone i could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place but since they didn't it's just one more to tack on i do give the movie credit for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it do see it if only one time however if you're like me you'll be saying triple k marine in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it
<START> i saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago and i haven't forgotten it to this day i couldn't say whether it's a good picture but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but i still remember the plot simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling david lean's great expectations and again it was the young jean simmons it's a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video i'd like to correct my memories
<START> wow i caught this on ifc recently after i watched but im a cheerleader id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting i went in with low expectations and now i must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film robin tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with the relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so and believable i usually hate romance and love films but this movie truly touched me i so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision
<START> the tagline for this show is he's speaking his mind we're hiring extra lawyers if you look back in time any classic raunchy comedian never prided himself in being controversial richard pryor's tagline wasn't i'm crude racist and daring that's basically how comedy central is marketing this show in your face non pc and honest but how can a television show pride itself in being this way where's the humility and humbleness and what suddenly has made carlos mencia this huge figure for comedy central let's start at the beginning dave cancels his show which became unexpectedly popular and controversial and comedy central is looking around for someone new to push they hire this guy named ned who claims to be a mexican even though he isn't they splatter his face on a few tv ads and make it look like they're being daring by unleashing him upon the public br br i've seen a lot of hateful topics on the forums for this show and i don't agree with mencia's detractors this is not an awful show it had me crying in laughter a few times when it's funny it's very very funny yes it's juvenile but so was chappelle's br br the problem with carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over and he's too obvious the overt marketing put aside carlos has now said so many times i have lost count he's trying to make it the next famous line like i'm rick james b but it's way too obvious br br in terms of repeating himself carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over for example on one episode he said he'd love it if all mexicans disappeared from america overnight he'd wake up and an american guy would be saying room in a southern accent br br he used this exact same joke verbatim when he appeared as a guest on adam talk show it was a great deal less funny the second time around because he seemed more desperate br br is carlos funny i think so there are some outrageous moments on his show but he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and letting his comedy naturally progress repeating silly little catchphrases over and over again coupled with goofy faces and loud vocal screams does indeed get old quite fast i just hope carlos or his writers can give a new edge to this show because right now it's starting to dwindle in repeat hell
<START> mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde br br michael mcguire was the dad br br tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon br br did you even see this movie i doubt it br br blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill popping doctor on fridays thomerson has been funny in anything he does from movies to series to stand up comedy if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it i recorded this movie off of hbo back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape one of the funniest takes on the jekyll hyde theme ever br br of course with all the cocaine references in this movie it'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today as would cheech and chong too bad because it is funny funny funny
<START> i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the assurance that hilary swank has always given excellent performances in her movies she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does and she didn't prove me wrong in this movie br br however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non speaking i have to single out jamie bartlett and the two main protagonists for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings the whole movie ran almost like a documentary br br i must applaud tom hooper as the director and avril as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to savour the photography br br why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award it seems to me to hit the high rating button on all counts it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit
<START> the biggest problem with this film is that it's nothing like bruce allmighty the first film played upon every fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit evan's experience though is entirely different he has none of the control that jim carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief now this would have been fine since the first film was preaching the same message the problem is that the sequel does it's preaching at the expense of the comic relief and to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot you get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film and it's main objective is not to make you laugh to sum things up this movie is failed mixture of eddie the distinguished gentleman and charlton heston's the ten commandments i'm not sure if steve carrell is at fault here you get a sense that it's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian the former news anchor evan baxter is not supposed to be funny he's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about
<START> while my kids enjoyed the movie and announced afterward that they want to buy it later i think i got more out of it that they did the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life i did not use the cutting comment aloud but i thought it it is a feel good mid life movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others why does the kid stay with bruce willis after he knows his mom is dying but all in all and good time it also gave our family something to talk about did my kids think my life was boring what do they expect at 40 how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids
<START> one of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the tories or british american loyalists are portrayed and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for king george iii in many ways the american revolution was definitely a family affair in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it if there is a strong criticism to be made of this film it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life br br in some regards the actions of the character of major played by cornel wilde make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline he seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of for the cause ' fellow this film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social in that day and age br br in its subtext the fact that about twenty five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro british is glossed over too but the strength of the tory element is not obviously maligned although the good doctor character is about eighty five percent upper class twit to steal a fine phrase from monty python's flying circus anne francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script and it stands out she was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties a who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed if there had not been a life and death struggle going on br br one good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the american revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort all in all the leading characters are very well drawn the minor characters are not just human props and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action br br this is a great spy movie it's not quite a great historical drama but it does satisfy well enough it rates a seven largely because cornel wilde is so deeply immersed in his role and does it so well and because anne francis makes the most of her supporting effort br br the color print used on turner classic movies was very clear as well and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard br br hope it runs again soon
<START> it's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one sound familiar it's supposed to it's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget br br can't get enough it's pure entertainment i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clichÃ©'s but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though good acting the entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise there was a lot of chemistry between the characters i was very entertained throughout the entire film and i am fully convinced the writer director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers the script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturally br br the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget i already know this going in this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy although this is not an oscar award winning opus it never claims to be and props to that it's a lot of fun if you like slashers you'll really appreciate this film if you like blood and boobies you'll appreciate it also
<START> i consider myself to have a decent sense of humor but this movie left me stunned in my chair br br it's so bad that it could just not have been any worse not once did i laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie i have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies but unfortunately this one will be the one i remember best in my nightmares br br the only reason anyone should want to watch this is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time br br this is the worst movie ever
<START> wow why aren't more british movies like this great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great one to hunt down and watch look out for it ten out of ten
<START> you just cant touch the new crop is just awful the jokes are not funny some of the troupe make me want to stop watching tv all together lorne you have let your creation go down the toilet the guests sometimes are good the bands are mostly garbage weekend update seth has to tell the audience when to laugh seth would get a proper reception in a baghdad cafe though make sure andy goes with him the show has about 10 jokes in all and they just keep rehashing them over and over even the segments that are obviously not funny offending people has become the name of the game but they cant even do that right just offensively i am so disappointed with what has happened to the show but now i also know it is safe to go out on a saturday night
<START> some days ago in rome a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping a romanian girl who had seen everything reported what happened br br therefore it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania generalizing them as criminals everyone indiscriminately br br i'm only 15 but i thought what idea of affluence does italy give to these poor people how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty yesterday evening i finally saw and my question had an answer when you have only a donkey and some goats those propaganda postcards showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables makes such an impression br br is really a must see film it balances an ethereal symbolism milk rivers play hard and rocky mountains the name and character lucy and a cruel realism the mass of hopeful people on the ship the procedures at ellis island there's a mixed cast going from the angelic charlotte gainsbourg to the realistic vincenzo amato till a bitter and smashing aurora as the mother but was it really so hard to enter in the new world
<START> heart of darkness a short novel written by joseph conrad about greed corruption and traveling through africa was to say the least a tedious read the narrator follows marlow a seaman who travels into the deep of africa to rescue kurtz somewhat of a prodigy ivory trader who supposedly went crazy this conclusion arose when the ivory stopped coming into the main port the basis of the story is conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings he sets the scene wonderfully but possibly a bit to extensively the story seemed more like a water color painting as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that conrad might have intended to pan out br br it sometimes happens that after you read a book maybe watching the feature film might help correspond some thoughts with those in the book or vise versa not so with heart of darkness even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor john malkovich the movie only confused me more there seemed to be no real main characters in the film no one stood out to the others non of the extensive symbolism was explained it was rather bland and to say the least br br in all do respect to the author the heart of darkness is a true short novel masterpiece it touches on some very severe subjects the lies of marlow and the greed of kurtz it is not a book to be taken lightly and will put you in a rather somber mood a book like this i feel might be to heavy for a lot of people i would however recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo action story without a textbook happy ending
