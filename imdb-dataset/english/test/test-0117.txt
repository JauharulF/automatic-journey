<START> whenever ida lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's 40's and 50's you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures in this film as mrs helen gordon high sierra '41 along with robert ryan howard wilton golden gloves '40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor mrs gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection if you liked ida lupino who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman's prison and prison warden who was hated this is the film for you to enjoy i truly believe that ida lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry
<START> some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour but when a film comes along that isn't as original as the classics but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po faced wanna be critics completely slag it off this film made me laugh aloud several times this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them everyone has friends like both of these guys another highlight for me was the monster truck it's awesome intimidating and really well shot taking inspiration completely stealing from loads of films the most obvious being duel jeepers creepers and probably in reference to the jack black alike co star orange county but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here but so what it's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it's a 10 obviously it's not getting a 10 i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99 of the people on imdb there is no way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ain't getting a 10 either it's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares you really can't get anymore simple than that
<START> a touching story told with tenderness awkward young jewish girl in wwii america befriends an escaped german pow who is hiding out in her clubhouse they discuss their lives and beliefs he's anti hitler she sneaks him food he becomes her only friend and ally all this reminded me of the much better theatrical film whistle down the wind where hayley mills befriends convict alan bates but you certainly can't fault the direction here which is smooth or the performances which are sterling mature in her pre teen years kristy carries most of the picture and never hits a false note suddenly when the prisoner is discovered and kristy is found out as well the movie gets very tough her father shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with that nazi lays into her with a quiet fury i have seldom seen before he tells her you are dead to me which must be devastating for a little girl to hear the final scenes don't cop out there are no big reunions no hand holding climaxes the girl has to face the world and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors friends and family a startling film
<START> i waited quite awhile till i was able to watch this lone ranger movie i finally got to see it on the lone star channel today and was very disappointed in the whole movie clayton moore and john hart acted better lone rangers and jay as tonto than the two stars in this movie very poor acting was done by everyone in this movie even the plot was bad and far fetching i believe the horse portraying silver was the best actor throughout this movie i am glad i didn't go out and buy a copy of this movie when it first came out as i feel it's a waste of good money i am truly sorry the characters that clayton moore john hart and jay played and brought to life on the silver screen have been tarnished so badly unless in the future they find actors worthy of portraying the characters in the same manner which clayton john and jay did so well in the past i'll not spend the money to buy the movie i'll not watch this movie again br br wayne davies
<START> now i'm a big animation fan love and usually am into all applications of stop motion so i had high hopes for this one then i came on imdb and paused i'm always real suspicious of films with a distribution of votes on imdb here we've got another a bunch of 10s shill anyone and then some real low ones i'm also suspicious of 10s with the word visionary in them br br sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them despite my misgivings i saw this film and have to side with the ones the stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish treat yourself to the real deal get some and leave this also ran on the shelf
<START> i rented this film courtesy of netflix thinking i would receive the 1972 version i sat clueless watching this new version thinking gee the production values were spectacular i was convinced the soundtrack had a slightly 70s' sound to it i was even more convinced that this was a 70s film when it occurred to me almost every five seconds that the one thing that was missing between gene and finney was an intense hug a loaded stare a passionate kiss br br i'm sorry although john knowles himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship it is painfully obvious that yes that's exactly what it was when people usually adolescents of the same sex have intense friendships it means that those longings for love togetherness the desire to express oneself sexually are all spilling over these boys needed to connect but they were never allowed to br br also despite a spirited performance by toby moore i never felt any of the emotions were real i never connected to either of the boys for the very reason their relationship was not truly honest br br people want to live in a fantasy and think that because this took place in the 1940s that these boys couldn't have had these sexual feelings for each other but i say they did at least in the book they did and in this movie finney had them almost painfully for gene the intensity that john knowles suggests existed between them was a closet homosexuality a hero worship an idolatry that would under normal circumstances be expressed in a sexual way even if these boys were repressing it it should have been crystal clear but this movie doesn't even really hint at it br br lastly there is an unbelievably bizarre moment when finney who has broken his leg is playfully jumped on by all the other boys during a ball game unless they were just a bunch of nincompoops they would know they could not possibly throw their bodies against him obviously this bone shattering moment was lost on both the director and the producer
<START> an eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious sect compound near waco texas seventy six people including sect leader david perished in a flaming inferno that destroyed the compound there is still heated debate over how the fire started homicide or suicide can you still trust government ethics br br
<START> the movie uses motifs that could be plagiarized from wait until dark 1967 a much better movie by terence young starring audrey hepburn dead silent is a pale paraphrase there is nothing new here the hidden object in the doll the bad men wanting it the bad guy posing as a good guy the disability though has shifted audrey hepburn couldn't see the child in ds cannot speak but both stories hinge on the handicap where wait until dark built up unbearable suspense dead silent lets you guess the outcome the story being such a stereotype
<START> i thought this movie was great i saw this when it came out in the theaters so i do not remember all the details i remember it being based on homer's tale on odysseus names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale br br i found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it i really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the romeo and juliet with clair danes br br i will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors
<START> this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff well then let me bash it to compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn't too bad it has the beautiful leslie cumming she is super hot but can't talk very well there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped she shows off her nice body linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff 3 10
<START> this film is wonderful film for students of film in mainstream american film it is common to see stylistic techniques used to draw the audience into the movie in this film the director uses stylistic techniques to push the story forward br br this is a love story that offers no sex to be honest i can't even recall the characters kissing rather the plot focuses on the emotional ties between the two characters br br i would not recommend this film for everybody it is not very accessible it is very slow moving and the subtle it is a difficult film and mostly not entertaining br br i would this film to people who want to see something different it is a piece of art the soundtrack is most beautiful and visually every frame is a photograph and most beautiful of all it's not visually stimulating for the sake of being visually stimulating every frame illustrates a little bit more of the story
<START> the movie started very well so far isabelle's exorcism could be believed but later gosh i didn't know if it was a horror movie a drama one or a must not see one the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie the make up well it looked pretty real at beginning but at the end last part of movie the make up especially teeth and eyes was very exaggerated if you want a good exorcism movie watch the exorcism of emily rose br br together with hard candy totally boring pathetic plot and ending these two movies are the worst i've seen from lionsgate but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films but with this one you will wish you never rent it exorcism movie fans just stay with two the exorcist and emily rose's exorcism
<START> well on the day that rob schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not at all wanted deuce bigalow european gigolo hmmmm wasn't there a film called roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called and now there's deuce bigalow male gigolo followed by sequel deuce bigalow european gigolo i smell a pattern perhaps soon there will be spiderman european webs are hotter or not i am writing about this much maligned at time of release film i was one of those i must admit i turned my nose up at it even while chris farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the snl cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94 '95 the norm mcdonald notwithstanding films like happy gilmore tommy boy and black sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of spade farley schneider sandler films however i watched this film the other day ten years after and 8 years after chris died and could not stop laughing yes it's not particularly sophisticated farley does what farley does not unlike manny being manny but his van down by the river motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not wash enough or wear well fitting clothes or use deodorant more than twice a week translates well here as the ever self effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest not the best looking and could stand to lose a few pounds all the same he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to and david spade just tosses off his snide one liners as he did for spade's hollywood minute and basically stings self esteem there's really not a whole lot more to say than that i love the one scene when farley catches spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it can't remember what the first one is but the second one they're lying in their hotel beds and farley says to spade do you like baseball spade mutters something inaudible in response and says the new york yank ees anyway farley does his awkward painfully sensitive frat boy shtick if you like you like it i couldn't stop laughing

<START> i will admit i didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film but to be honest i don't think it would have mattered basically local sidney fiddler sid james persuades the incompetent mayor frederick bumble kenneth connor of to hold a beauty contest to improve the town's image they face opposition from women's augusta june whitfield trying to sabotage the contest but they do have publicity agent peter potter bernard bresslaw and palace hotel owner connie joan sims soon enough the young beautiful wannabe models show up including hope springs barbara windsor paula perkins valerie leon dawn brakes margaret nolan debra sally geeson and ida downs eastenders' wendy richard when the girls have cat fights it does draw away regular residents but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and william jack douglas having over active twitches it does finally reach the competition and it's just afterwards i couldn't be bothered also starring patsy rowlands as mildred bumble peter butterworth as admiral joan as mrs dukes david lodge as police inspector angela grant as miss arnold ridley as pratt robin as larry patricia franklin as rosemary jimmy logan as cecil and dad's army's bill pertwee as fire brigade chief charles hawtrey had obviously quit the carry ons but where's kenneth williams i suppose seeing babs and young beautiful looking pauline fowler in bikinis but for comedy value this fails miserably and the overuse of the whistle just gets on your nerves pretty poor
