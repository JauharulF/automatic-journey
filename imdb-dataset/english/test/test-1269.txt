<START> this feels as if it is a czech version of pearl harbor it has a same story both guys fall in love with the same woman and add to the twist the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year i don't think that the story line is too strong the younger guy is quite naughty that is cute it kept me watching because of the emotional music and the pleasing scenes one after another it also has some strong visual special affects best of all the love stories is seamlessly integrated with the story br br i think that if it was in english it would be such a big shot all across the states it is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies
<START> this is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare besides that it's a lot of fun br br hardware wars is the only good spoof on star wars other films like spaceballs have failed this is the only good spoof film i have ever seen it doesn't rip off star wars it makes fun of it and that's what spoofs are supposed to be
<START> i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night frankly i have never heard about this movie before simply i lost track of recent movies for each one is worst than the previous one here again we have a dull seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully the plot is ridiculous acting is below zero and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart i simply don't have any idea why seagal did this movie man it is even worst than out for a kill if you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for seagal he seems to be running out of ideas enthusiasm and money avoid this movie and do something worthwhile
<START> a very good movie about anti semitism near the end of wwii the scene that really speaks loudly of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest is giving his speech against the international money and communists it sounds amazingly like the speeches that adolph hitler used to force down his peoples' throats yet none of the meeting attendees seem to make this comparison
<START> am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the 1934 english film the english version has no suspense looks antique and very low budget and has unexceptional acting except for peter lorre the 1956 version besides having top production values shows james stewart as the perfect american abroad and gives doris day her best role ever of particular note is the music the music of the american film is almost classic compare the albert hall' sequences of both and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version even though it's basically the same music the only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better
<START> a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr joan claiming to be the demon kane hodder the torturer of the 13th level of the hell and he would like to tell weird things he tells that he had made a deal with lucifer to become human again he should knock up his virgin sister mary elizabeth alison brie on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti christ and then he would escape from the pit and reborn when mary elizabeth gets pregnant her stressed and abusive sister catherine denise crosby does not believe that she is virgin but their father and former albert martino james callahan examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father anthony eddie velez to spy mary elizabeth she is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver lars jorg who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods but she believes that she has nightmares however during the she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy but it is too late br br the awful born is a b movie actually a z movie that believes that is a great movie the result is a pretentious and disappointing production with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction the plot is a complete mess there is a priest that is a hit man and former soldier a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric a father that examines the virginity of his daughter two female demons succubus that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes a character that is a slut and only exists to expose her beautiful body there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity but the worst is the acting the unknown lead actress alison brie is histrionic with ridiculous voices and grimaces sorry ms alison brie but i hated your annoying performance i have not recognized joan who has a good performance since i still had the image of her youth denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody she got older but she is still a good actress i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b movie the story might have worked better and better my vote is three br br title brazil o anti cristo the anti christ
<START> manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time you know that the characters after finding out that the so called gift from god was actually a loan will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end but how they get there is not as obvious the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip frank gorshin shirley jones and cloris leachman prove that they are capable of more than playing the riddler mother partridge or mary's friend phyllis while jill eikenberry and malick play characters different than we have seen on their tv series ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music including a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try i don't think you will be disappointed
<START> it's strange while the film features full x rated sex scenes and violent murders it never feels as shocking as it ought to br br a group of scientists go to an island in the caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident upon their arrival a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women doesn't it always seem to work out that way br br among the acts we find a some lesbian encounters a three way with male prostitutes assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of an already dead body even though it's all fully explicit it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it's edge the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex br br there is some blood and gore with the murders but given that this is a d'amato flick it's really tame for a much more rounded experience watch the similar nights of the living dead' br br 2 10
<START> i just watched for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago and while i remember liking it at the time i don't remember being blown away by it like i was today i really can't complain about anything in this movie craig scheffer is excellent as the lead character of boone i never understood why he hasn't had a more successful career because most of his early work is outstanding as good as scheffer is cronenberg is even better his portrayal of the psycho dr decker is unforgettable and steals the show the rest of the cast which includes doug bradley is very good save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff the visuals are good and in some shots great the danny elfman composed score is as good as it gets and is among his best work the ending was epic with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes overall is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker and ranks as my favorite of his movies just slightly ahead of hellraiser 9 10
<START> a long time ago way back in the early '80s a late night tv show fridays came to abc trying to steal the limelight away from nbc's badly listing saturday night live it didn't but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi talented comedians to the world like mark for example br br which in a roundabout way brings us to jekyll and hyde together again which is repugnant in ways all its own br br is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion and about as tasteful too this is just his drugged out character he played on the ill fated fridays show stretched out to feature length and if you didn't like him there why are you reading this review br br any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie that's a bad sign then when it goes for headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross out things can only get worse br br a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poe's fall of the house of usher br br aside from a few very few gags that give a slight grin this whole film is an exercise in waste wasted actors wasted film wasted opportunities br br no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave what more observant a review could they give themselves br br no stars no not even for armstrong who should have known better br br hyde from this one
<START> hunk of trash only the full moon studios could make has a group of college kids staying for free in an old hospital with no one knowing as a demonic creature with two faces barely visible the entire film because of incomprehensible lighting passes through walls killing each member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient markings someone amongst them it won't be too hard to prove but a slight twist is so revealed and limply executed you'll just scoff is the mastermind behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone br br cheap badly acted mess has a that's it kind of weak ending that'll have you exasperated at why you just wasted your time tanya dempsey who couldn't act her way through a wet paper sack has the heroine duties as the newest member of the college rooming bunch named clark oh and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks it's next victim
<START> when the romulans come they will not be bearing gifts no they bring with them war war and conquest as any familiar with this episode know it is a redux of the war film the enemy below from the fifties the obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine or an american destroyer german u boat engaged in lethal war games it is two starships in outer space in trek history about 100 years before the events here according to this episode earth fought the wars after about 5 years of conflict a stalemate brought about a treaty and the institution of the neutral zone a boundary between us and the empire now on this the treaty appears to be broken as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power yes the romulans are back testing their new war toy and kirk must now earn his pay he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy such as figuring out how to avoid a oh i dunno an interstellar war maybe br br i think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't shy away from the grim aspects of war as one would expect of a mere tv episode from the sixties especially an episode from a science fiction show it's all very tense and gripping like the best war films such as when kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war council the writers and the actors aren't kidding around here this is all preparation for a ghastly conflict potentially the beginning of another years long battleground in the final analysis kirk's aim is to keep this battleground to just the two ships but even then it's an endeavor fraught with peril and probable casualties in fact i believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it right at the start of the episode we see the devastation such battle can produce in that supposedly well protected outpost then begin the cat and mouse war games between the enterprise and the ship it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen of course if you're not into war films you'd have to look for other things to admire in this episode br br what elevates this episode even further is the revelation of just what and who the romulans are it's an electric shock of a sort now we have even further inter crew conflict on the bridge of the enterprise war does tend to bring out the worst in some people due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future the tension is up even further kirk has his hands full in this one i suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient of the bigotry issue by the conclusion on the side actor makes his first appearance in the trek universe as the commander he's terrific in the role the flip side of capt kirk or capt pike take your pick done up to resemble spock more than a little surprisingly his character is not war hungry as we would expect another eye opener for this episode the actor would next return to this universe as spock's father so he's nothing if not versatile it's also telling how the first appearance of such characters as the romulans is usually their best shot as it is here they showed up in the enterprise incident next
<START> spoilers included br br alfred hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of robert novel was an amazing film unlike anything previous every shot every camera angle every nuance was perfect he didn't just break the rules he made up a whole set of new ones br br here's the spoiler there is absolutely nothing new different or original about this movie gus van sant doesn't just pay a homage to hitch he rips off every idea and does so in a less original more conventional manner i didn't have anything against gus van sant before i saw this movie i liked drugstore cowboy and i thought my own private idaho was a very interesting film the question burning in my mind when it comes to the remake of psycho is why did you do it gus br br in my mind there are only two reasons to do a remake 1 the original was a good story but the movie sucked 2 the original was a good movie but someone has thought of a fresh new approach to the material neither one of these factors is at all present in the gus van sant version of psycho apart from the fact that it is in color and there is one scene in which there is a montage of disturbing imagery relating to the title character's possible inner dialogue which i found unnecessary there is nothing new here br br furthermore i found the casting left something to be desired anne heche was okay as marion but she lacked a certain vulnerability that janet leigh portrayed in the original i didn't feel as sympathetic towards her character because the choices she faced seemed far less constrained as a woman in today's society as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early 1960's vince vaughn got a few laughs with his rendering of an incredibly naive norman bates but i feel that anthony timing and nervous haunted look was much more effectively creepy the only performance that i enjoyed better than the original was the character of lila crane played by moore she was excellent as usual and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character br br to be fair there is some beautiful camera work especially during the famous bathroom scene in which van sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson and yet during the whole film i had this irritating sense of vu haven't i seen this somewhere before oh wait i have seen this somewhere before nearly every scene seems to be copied shot for shot from the original one almost gets the feeling the director made this film as a school project see i can make a hitchcock film too br br if you haven't already go see the original it's held up over the years and beats this bit of mediocrity hands down you won't be disappointed
<START> this is like a zoology textbook given that its depiction of animals is so accurate however here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film br br handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons it doesn't matter how many times you shoot at the komodo bullets just won't go near it br br the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra or a giant komodo dragon is just to stand there the exception to this rule is if you've been told to stay very still in which case you should run off until the komodo is right next to you and then you should stand there expecting defeat br br minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching br br 5 000 is a memory enhancement tool and an ample substitute for losing your boating license getting arrested br br members of elite army units don't see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one of the over sized beings maybe the computer generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it br br when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need sound gear a second camera microphones etc are all superfluous br br when you hear a loud animal scream and one person has a gun he should take it out and point it at the nearest person br br when you take a gun out the sound of the safety being taken off will be made even if your finger is nowhere near the safety br br reporters agree to go half way around the world in order to expose something without having the faintest idea what they're exposing background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism br br handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip and then more than that in the next clip despite that those with guns claim that they will need more ammo br br expensive cameras also remember that the reporter only has one camera are regularly left behind without even a moment's hesitation or regret these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves br br the blonde girl really is the stupid one br br the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it thus making it unsafe takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection and nobody says a word about it br br high tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets br br genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day but don't grow at all in the weeks either side br br the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don't meet contact deadlines br br men with guns don't necessarily change the direction they're shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them instead they just keep shooting into the air br br the better looking you are the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures br br women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds br br any time you're being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age br br animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for at the same volume br br old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military
<START> i honestly didn't think at first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects boy was i wrong from the very beginning to the very end the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like evil dead and gremlins this movie could be compared to peter jackson's works of art though this movie isn't as gory as braindead but i sure wait these make another splatter movie
