<START> a frustrating documentary louis kahn's son who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life it sounds like a great idea for a documentary but it ends up flat and uninteresting br br sadly the basic problem is that kahn's son nathaniel is not just one of the film's protagonists he is also director writer producer interviewer and narrator nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles further while he seems like a nice enough guy he doesn't have much screen presence so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing br br nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uh huh as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response at times i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation br br dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahn's personality and career presumably because it's not clear from nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama aren't you angry mom and don't offer much in terms of helping us or nathaniel understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him br br what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand not to exclude nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience an independent director could have stood away from the material given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and one hopes cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with kahn's first cousin who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building strangers to tell them that his father was the designer huh nice sir gotta go now i understand why these things might be important to nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personal br br as an aside i thought the score written for the film was great but one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when during the tour of the kimball art museum the voice over quotes kahn as making a comparison between architecture and beethoven's fifth symphony the music being played at the same time beethoven's ninth symphony a mistake a miscue who knows it did make me laugh br br kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story there's definitely a good documentary to be made about him one is sympathetic to search for the father he didn't know but i'm not sure whether that is an interesting story neither works so well in this film
<START> i will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when i saw it for the first time from the moment that the major is startled by the clown to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation we're alive we're people we must have memories quote but close to his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape this is riveting drama br br little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it the moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone to the off key screeching bagpipes of the scottish musician the wistful remark a miss is as good as a mile the shaken conclusion that they must be in hell br br this is a brilliant episode beautifully written and acted the breathtaking beauty of susan harrison adds to the of the strange touching story
<START> i think that never been kissed was a totally awesome movie the casting was really good and they acted very well i really like drew barrymore and of course for me it was excellent i was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video boy am i happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie go see it if you already haven't
<START> zombie movies are hot i love 'em can't get enough why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation i just really love zombies surprise this really isn't much of a zombie movie low budget i can handle being duped just irritates me br br a group of horror film clichÃ©s hold up in a warehouse lab who knows what to escape a fire storm outside panic yelling low light and eventually zombies ensue br br i kind of feel bad for the film makers as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good a serious scary horror film it isn't far from it it's a boring mess of wooden acting cheesy fx poor lighting excessive dialogue and over editing br br things first go awry when it takes a good 10 minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on it gets worse when another 20 minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on all of this is littered with non acting and bad dialogue br br finally some one gets attached not by a zombie though and hope flickers just a touch before the characters are again lounging around whining the only emotion any one every generates about how much this sucks me too guys me too br br finally zombies are in the mix but no one watching cares any more i think there was some blood and gore tossed in but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the pointlessly 'cube' inspired ending br br i will give credit for trying very hard even if it failed miserably that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under used br br can't really recommend this to anyone save for film students looking for 'no no' pointers br br 4 10
<START> this film stinks more than limburger cheese if you find this at a garage sale leave it there i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie although ashamed i do own a copy and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all they play it up to be a sandra bullock movie she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that but she is young and had not learned her talent yet well everyone has to start somewhere
<START> i enjoyed the muppet movie very much it was the first of the muppet movies and is by far the best because it's so creative and fresh with later films the ideas just didn't seem quite so original but here we get to see kermit and miss piggy riding bikes an incredibly difficult scene an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun i loved every minute the muppets were performing and i would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem in this and most subsequent muppet films some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non muppets in particular many many cameos by stars some worked fine such as charles but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt probably the worst of them was with edgar bergan yes he was an amazing man who inspired jim henson and the rest of his crew but the tiny scene he's in just wasn't needed nor were most of the cameos still despite this big complaint it's a great film for the entire family from the kids to even the most demanding adults
<START> this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer director bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks pantomime dance and various physical devices br br although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages br br this work was televised as a pbs special bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show but out of context it did not go over well
<START> when i saw gone with the wind i thought that there could not be better actors than vivian leigh and clark gable to play scarlett and rhett but then i saw the movie scarlet i fell in love for this dramatic story i love timothy dalton as rhett butler he's fantastic this is a movie i could watch a thousand times and it still wouldn't bore me
<START> i'd have to agree with the previous reviewer this film has awesome animation but has problems throughout the rest of the movie br br plot holes are huge dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot the main plot points aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film the characters state the obvious while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film there are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained most of them have names that are only mentioned once and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer br br don't waste your time with this movie unless you are in it for a good laugh and how dumb it is
<START> a gem from japan where so many of the world's best films are being made today stylistically this isn't anything all that special it's just a simple drama with some comic overtones about recognizable people going about their lives yuko tanaka best known for voicing the character lady in princess mononoke plays a 50 year old spinster she's takes pride in her health spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of nagasaki after she is done with this part time job she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store called s mart which made this army of darkness fan giggle along her milk route lives a 50 year old man whose wife is dying it turns out the milk woman and the man a child services worker dated in high school and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other the film actually has some major narrative problems when the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique the climactic sequence is also really forced but most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters as well as many side characters the film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down but never end up doing so i think the best thing in the film is heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life whatever the problems were the film mostly transcends them
<START> i just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn't funny or that it's boring br br here's the trick the film is not meant to be just a comedy it's got some depth to it like many demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves br br unfortunately the movie and home video industries don't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the comedy bin it is funny but a lot of the humor is off beat however the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it br br it may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining br br and the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself michelle pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty mercedes ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can in a role which requires it throw in oliver platt joan cusack in smaller roles and the talented dean stockwell and even chris and you've got a great cast throughout which here as usual makes a great difference br br matthew modine is fun but more important he's a major hottie in this movie hot cute and sexy br br sit back expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time
<START> there is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world you can watch ma and pa with adults with your family kids any age or just by yourself like me they are gentle but gentle is so refreshing in a society of kids killing kids a horrible war inappropriate prime time television and poverty we don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from give me modern plumbing and i'll gladly become a kettle humor does not require offensive language it is hard to follow conversations in shows where every other word is relax take your shoes off and climb in your with a good old fashioned glass of lemonade and just breathe easy watching ma sweeping the chickens off the table at lunch time pj
<START> crossfire is ostensibly a murder mystery but what distinguishes it from other similar movies of the period is the killer's motive which is anti semitism the story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance which fuels bigotry and contains references to a hillbilly and an irish immigrant who also suffered maltreatment because of their ethnicity br br the movie's plot is based on richard brooks' novel called the brick foxhole which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay it's ironic that this story about a form of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censors who that for the screen version the type of bigotry involved should be changed to anti semitism another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems fiercely proud of having served in a war against the nazis and yet embraces their hatred of jews the director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the house un american activities committee all these points just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this movie br br when police captain finlay robert young investigates the murder of joseph sam levene he discovers that on the night when he was killed had been with a group of soldiers and one of these corporal arthur mitch mitchell george cooper is quickly identified as the prime suspect further information is also gathered from montgomery robert ryan who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and sergeant robert mitchum who's a friend of mitchell with the help of some other soldiers then searches for mitchell and when he finds him hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called ginny tremaine gloria grahame br br helps michell to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer ginny tremaine is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove mitchell's innocence but finlay's investigations lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real culprit into exposing his own guilt br br crossfire is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story the message is conveyed in a way which was no doubt appropriate for the period in which it was made but by today's standards seems rather heavy handed the cinematography by j roy hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen br br despite it being a low budget production crossfire was a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast two of whom were nominated for academy awards for best supporting actor robert ryan and best supporting actress gloria grahame the additional nominations for edward best director producer adrian scott best picture and john paxton best writing adapted screenplay are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received
<START> even if it won't give one more than previous posts here like ruby liang's very good one i wanted to share my own point of view hope my english is understandable br br bon voyage is a rhythmic light but deep presentation of the french unorganized come down but also courage and charm all along in a brilliantly reconstituted 1940 france with many details from bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by government hq and attacked by useless high class french to parisian coffees near le pantheon rue and 1930s cars gÃ©rard depardieu and yvan attal give their second roles a brilliant taste isabelle adjani and ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles and makes an bewitching performance br br much lighter than average e g american war times movies and focused on the civilians bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues even to a french guy like me some of them quite deep
<START> i think it was a pretty good film it shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him it led to his destruction it shows that you can't trust anyone especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy the character that i mostly liked was she was another ambitious powerful and ruthless woman in a man's world who loved and respected kilo she also knew that business was business and a dangerous one everything she did was risky but got the job done she helped kilo become rich with her connections overall i really liked this film and have it in my collection and waiting for el padrino 2
