<START> i laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering i wasn't having a bad day nor was i subjected to anything else that would've skewed my opinion while watching this cinematic bowel movement this movie is bad i wanted to enjoy it and i just couldn't with all of this talent you'd think this would've been at least watchable right wrong br br let's play sucked and didn't suck john travolta very likable though obviously buried under too much makeup i found him to be enjoyable to watch didn't suck br br uma thurman after kill bill 1 and 2 the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character this character's big moment was showing someone how to operate a t mobile sidekick sucked br br vince vaughn the done to death role of white guy who thinks he's black goes to vince money vaughn is this character template still considered to be funny i love the guy but i want to see him in something better than this it felt like he was slumming sucked br br cedric the entertainer this guy is good he delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur you can probably guess as to what it is that was probably the best part of the movie he was funny and truly elevated the material he was given just with his presence didn't suck br br harvey keitel sucked due to a phoned in performance br br james woods sucked but not his fault actually yes it was reminded me of his role in casino for some reason i don't like manic james woods i like slow burn james woods victim of bad writing maybe andre 3000 sucked but he went down swinging i think he has potential as long as he's not being directed by a hack on his next picture br br christina she's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isn't going to make her a star didn't suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isn't directed by a hack br br the rock this should have been the role that catapulted him to movie stardom but as directed by f gary gray winds up sadly mishandled in this movie the rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that i wound up feeling sorry for him he tries really hard and while he doesn't succeed completely he gets an a for effort from me this guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom i really want to see him make it big he has what it takes as long as he's not being directed by a hack br br which brings me to what i feel was the weak link in this production i might as well just come out and say it right f gary gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea wow it was bad who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct the negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job between his direction and the atrocious writing i'm willing to chip in for both culprits to get a nice lead salad to the knees wanna see john and uma dance i might be able to think of another movie with those two that i could recommend watching instead of this not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater br br this movie could've been okay and it wasn't even just okay br br rating out of br br p s from black eyed peas is noteworthy to mention sizzling
<START> burt reynolds plays gator a likable ex convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff laid back reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these 'good ol' boy' performances in true he's on auto pilot throughout but in his day reynolds knew just how to make a low key effort work well for himself ingratiating and handsome reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star while director joesph sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the south alive unfortunately the story isn't much and supporting actors ned beatty and bo hopkins overact as usual diane ladd is fine in a small part and real life daughter laura dern can be glimpsed in the background reynolds returned to this character for 1976's gator 1 2 from
<START> no holds barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously it sucks hardcore as a serious movie look at it more in the way that you should plan 9 from outer space they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny the funny moments in no holds barred are usually the ones that aren't supposed to be when rip played by hulk hogan as only he can play them grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with kurt fuller hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see it might be the funniest scene ever i swear br br anyway how someone thought this movie would make money i'll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission i hope they at least got fired this movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts
<START> it is definitely not worth spending either money or time it is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love but this is with a western touch but it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love there is no depth to either of their characters probably with a better cast some justice could have been brought about to the characters finally it is a movie with no fun no acting no theme no plot no comedy no action no thrill no romance i associate romance to something more passionate definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family overall if you are looking for a movie with some content this is definitely not an option i shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a must watch movie
<START> it's up there with where's poppa the groove tube it the ny city mind set of the period a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan hoist by by own petard and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents totally absurd its the life one sees through the magic glasses seeing things as they really are i don't think it is ever shown anymore if so surely someone would tivo the thing and put it out there a kidnap goes awry mixed up in a rain storm dashing in and out or our hero tosses a raincoat over his prey and tossing her into his bicycle powered ice cream wagon spirits her off to his basement apartment in the village he is amazed surprised and incredibly disappointed when the wraps come off instead of a luscious lady he has captures a middle ages suburban housewife who talks and talks and talks the film is full of vignettes of the life the suburban life the city officials and all the attitudes so dearly held it pushes the limits of comedy such as magical reality might push a drama much as daffy duck is able to draw on imaginative scenes to demonstrate his plight or desires all at the very edge of plausibility all of it is humorous nobody is mean
<START> it has been almost 50 years since i saw jennifer for the first and only time i did not know the name of this movie until i looked it up on this web site but i have told many people especially my grandchildren how movies do not have to include graphic details in order to frighten you and leave powerful impact the story skillfully introduces you to concepts which if true put ida lupino in a very dangerous situation each time miss lupino discovers a new fact she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear br br this movie has such impact on me that almost 50 years later i still list it as one of the most frightening movies that i have ever seen yet this movie does not contain the blood and gore which became popular shortly after this movie was made it's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make
<START> my mom and i went to see this film because my brother is serving in the u s peace corps in the same region in which it's set halfway through the film i decided that given its failure to measure up to what it pretends to accomplish the title is pretentious the subject it deals with could have made for an excellent documentary but because of its poor execution it left me far less educated about the issue than i had hoped to become i agree with laura jane from canada powerful message but lacks focus i also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker's narration free style is the opposite of that of michael moore but i don't agree that it presents varying points of view and invites the viewer to decide for him or herself i do agree with one user's comment that a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves however our conclusions can't be anything but poorly founded if we are presented with little relevant information from which to draw them br br the main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1 the african people who live near lake victoria are very poor and suffer greatly 2 the introduction of perch to lake victoria inflicted by europeans ruined its ecosystem 3 the communities surrounding lake victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy br br the best things i can say about the film is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub saharan africa which unfortunately is an anomaly among films and that it attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal inevitable phenomenon i liked the irony it captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a famine i appreciated the portrayal of how out of touch the u n team assigned to the region was with the people like almost all documentaries that don't have the word women in the title this film fails to do a good job representing women's voices the majority of the talking done in interviews is that of men br br maybe i need to watch the film a second time in order to catch some key points i might have missed but i failed to detect theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to lake victoria and the unjust living conditions for africans living near the lake furthermore i could be wrong but it struck me that could do well to improve his interview skills not only did the questions he asked and the responses he included seem to be arbitrary but he seemed to have a real knack for making interviewees awkward and uncomfortable br br the most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the of perch now functions to mask the of arms and that the real economy screwing over is that of war not fishing sadly shies away from conducting a thorough expose of the idea or at least extending the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in regards to the weapons and cops out with a decide for yourself approach br br if darwin's nightmare was meant to dispel the myth that first world exploitation of the third world gives them a chance for a better life it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to depict how the weapons manufacturing industry in the u s and europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to cast light on the inability of the u n to carry out its mission it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to say that meager income earn from the perch isn't worth the human cost of tinkering with mother nature to create a profitable product it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to imply that would be much better off had europeans never come it didn't do a good job of it
<START> since this cartoon was made in the old days felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today however compared to its contemporaries it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well that's because despite its age the cartoon is very creative and funny br br felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes well felix needs money so he can go to hollywood so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store in gratitude the guy gives felix 500 however felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone so felix figures out a way to sneak along br br once there felix into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin in the end though through luck felix is discovered and offered a movie contract hurray
<START> for a movie like this there's always something to follow by in years to come clive barker the man who brought hellraiser makes a horror movie that is part goth part mythology and all horror in between are a bunch of mutants who only come out at night and roam the place called now a man name boone craig sheffer claims to suffer hallucinations he goes to this shrink dr decker david who helps boone with his problems unaware of this situation decker claims to be a purist which he's only a hate monger in disguise boone however goes into and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there but a mutant named oliver parker sees boone as meat his bite however spares boone so after he is killed by a gauntlet of fire arms he's one of them now after being mislead by decker boone does everything in his power to protect lori anne bobby from him lori saves a mutant from the sun and in return helps the others as well i liked the lady mutants one who gives a smoky kiss of death and the porcupine woman who dreamed boone show off her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time i've enjoyed this horror movie all the way and the rule of it is never trust a shrink rating 3 5 out of 5 stars
<START> i think gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head interesting film but very long it's definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy sexy moore style docs there is no narrator no facts or side info interlaced and no other gimmicks what you see is what you get a glimpse into the vanishing world of the of tibet as a huge doc fan i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film namely due to the length and lack of dialogue in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you it's beautifully shot informative and presents a valuable and closing window into the way of life of the tibetan and women all important attributes of a good doc but do put on a big pot of coffee it'll help
<START> talking about competition features at the split film festival we have titles from all over the world china korea canada usa and australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears modern love thats for sure br br in that movie by alex two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances the coastal village seems like something in an american horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants but episodes in alex can't be described as horror in the normal way in fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more in this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric australian film making thus is the the case of always something new and fresh visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some australian directors is astonishing good movie is super there is something in the australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in modern love and in ray lawrence movies lantana and jindabyne br br it seems it will be the same in future titles of alex
<START> i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films living in taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in america i have seen movies make fun of themselves but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors awful props and awful music to be taken seriously i seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie how sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what i thought should have been titled generic ninja fight scene op 1 or variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girl's head when backed into a corner or the daring flight of the helicopter then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled those actually had me in tears laughing if the special effects weren't proof enough that this was low budget the fact that only two or three of the crew members presumably locals which although good for the much needed economy was probably done solely to save money have ever done anything since this series of movies they rented equipment despite making sequels to this movie that was pretty funny too the thing that really had me going though was not the music which left me half expecting an animated sargeant slaughter from g i joe to pop up but the ending i suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil but when the american ninja drops the girl into jackson's arms and then takes off his mask i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch him br br i think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie
<START> when the gilmore girls started in germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique it was a series and i even did not know someone in it later on i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard a movie i absolutely adore i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since it's just fun you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time i do not do these things all the time but when i do these things i feel a little bit like a gilmore girl even my boyfriend started to watch them and that tells something from season to season it got better with the scripts and the stories they have a open mind and by being different from every other show you want to be like them
<START> what a disappointment a perfectly good hunk like antonio sabato jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth i cringed at 95 of the dialog it would have been better to have made the character a mute how antonio sabato and michael pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me if michale character prefaced or ended just one more sentence with the word i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set i love to multitask especially to get through bad movies must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now and the bad guy if he was so bad why didn't he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks even the title was a misnomer a landing' means the plane actually crashes and doesn't just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script br br this movie is a stinker
<START> sending the critters to space does seem like an entertaining idea but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one a film with brad dourif can't be all bad can it well maybe in this case this cheap sci fi effort stars returning lovable klutz charlie the reliable don keith who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the species when ugh terrence mann tells him that he's about to break some sort of trans galactic endangered species law so at ugh's request charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod unfortunately for charlie the damn thing takes off for space and he's trapped inside the smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepit br br space station as captain rick with fat cigar rude alcoholic malevolence and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade rick unbeknown est to him lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh you see rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it ugh reports to them now in a fine prominent position as counselor that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the organization once the crew dock they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition but what's worse is the station computer angela angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left without proper maintenance for some time it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers brad dourif is al bert pretty much the impresario of computer functions and is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most level headed and intelligent he seems to be a father figure to ethan paul who just wants to make it to earth to find his father this story though doesn't necessarily reach it's zenith bernie eric dare is primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on in the film charlie after one critter enters rick's mouth and eats away at his throat yuk becomes the crew's guide in understanding what they are fighting against the film has some elements i found rather confusing or for a better word ridiculous the two critters grow in size quickly are somehow able to coordinate a ship for earth not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station the crew are able to tap into a log from a dr mccormick anne ramsay whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access card which shows signs that was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures things don't work out that way because well meaning charlie thanks in part to al bert's ancient colt 45 kills a critter which had got on board but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship so many repairs on in order but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers dock at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought they'd be ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the for purposes of a cruel nature representation of corrupt corporate governmental types this betrayal is what changes charlie he has perhaps grown up a bit a wee bit and now understands that some people just change for the worse charlie and ugh will come to a face off over those critters will the crew be able to escape a space station which has set auto destruct this film really doesn't exploit the critters as much as the other three films i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise the first film was a hoot a really entertaining romp but by the time this sequel cam around the critters just wore out their welcome the cast however do give the film a boost the critters do get to feed a bit but their plans of global domination is under developed their role in the film isn't established to the greatest heights i said to myself you have this enormous space station with unfortunates trapped on board could you not take this idea and run with it sadly they don't
