<START> this adaption contains two parts br br 1 the now time when gulliver is at home in england and soon is put into a mental asylum by the evil dr bates br br 2 the described time in which gulliver describes his travels br br the times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part and followed the book as written in the book there is no dr bates no asylum and mrs gulliver gets very little mention the travels in plural are depicted as one in the movie there are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there look at them if you want that stuff the now time part adds absolutely nothing to the story's value is a complete invention by the movie adapters and takes valuable time from the real story all the time when this was going on i was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown br br so much for the drawbacks the parts which actually are part of the real story are well done and the cgi is really well done for its time many small and a few medium sized parts of the real travels are simply cut out but that does not make the story halt this is the only version which depicts all four travels and for that the movie should get special mention br br the two interspersed parts get approximately equal time i rate the first part 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage as 8 10 averaging out i give it a 4 10 if only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99 on the actual travels since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels br br why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon swift's work i do not know my best guess is that cgi was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets gci etc in order to keep total costs under some limit while at the same time producing a mini series which clocked in at some set number of minutes
<START> another in the long line of conan wannabes that tired to cash in on that movie's success this italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came you know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply there wasn't money for either adequate special effects or to hire real people i won't even bother going into the plot as i defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline maybe it's the television cut i watched but i can't imagine any version being that much better it all seems so random to me evil sorcerers cavemen giant snakes medieval castles grenades and hang gliding Â none of it fits together it's as if director joe d'amato had an epileptic fit while making cave dwellers or any of the other half dozen names the movie goes by and threw everything he could think of onto the screen regardless of how unrelated it was or how it fit into the film's already puzzling plot the acting is sufficiently bad miles o'keeffe could never act his way out of a wet paper bag and he proves that once again in this movie the rest of the cast is equally atrocious then there's the well you get the idea it's late i'm tired and i've already wasted more than enough time writing about this piece of garbage take my word for it Â avoid cave dwellers or whatever you want to call it at all costs
<START> basil rathbone and nigel bruce as sherlock holmes and dr watson respectively the second of the universal series where it's again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and spans time this helps to comfortably set things up here in the present era of the early 1940's br br in this offering holmes goes through a few different disguises with rathbone's very prominent features is it likely that people really wouldn't recognize his true identity as he protects a physicist from the hands of the nazis as well as from holmes' greatest nemesis professor moriarty now played by lionel atwill the scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in aerial bombardment and he's promised his plans to the british but moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the nazis br br a good entry boosted a bit by the participation of the properly villainous atwill now cast as moriarty though george zucco was no slouch himself in the adventures of sherlock holmes it's always intriguing watching holmes and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together the needle to the last eh holmes
<START> this is one of the most boring films i've ever seen the three main cast members just didn't seem to click well giovanni ribisi's character was quite annoying for some reason he seems to like repeating what he says if he was the rain man it would've been fine but he's not br br 3 out of 10

<START> this movie tries to be more than it is first of all the acting is horrible you have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting the plot is quite interesting a shipwreck occurs apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood and a couple of guys find themselves on shore if this weren't bad enough some guy named count de sade is living there as well he lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane anyway he has a large slave a young woman and some dogs there's another woman who doesn't speak and his wife who is a leper anyway things get bad as these men have to deal with this nut case he is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines the rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape it has an ironic ending which i won't reveal and it kind of rescues the film i wouldn't bother if i were you
<START> lord protector is kiddie fare but for whose kids obviously shot for television or stv this amateurish rehash krull has several stock characters a magician an assassin a warrior a scientist on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet badly written acted and staged in available california locations like municipal parks and a ranch lord protector has nothing to recommend it not even as a time waster jay underwood is the only name actor and most people especially the intended audience of five year olds are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human a no name actor playing a magician in an ill fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king lear i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence alas the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks like bert gordon's the magic sword the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be often such cheap hollywood back lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time trying to figure which was which in this one i didn't have much luck
<START> ah the sci fi channel how often do you disappoint me quite often i think do you ever show good movies ok you have given me the great 'heroes' and the reasonably good 'the lost room' but they are series and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say bad acting bad directing terrible characters and a shallow story and that is just for starters i checked out the director allan a and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name the premises of four motor bikers out motto crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens leading man bryan the park ranger is so bad it is terrible cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew avoid at all costs
<START> okay this movie starts out and it looks like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan she has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap sort of the inverse of the main characters in pleasantville and runs away to los angeles to meet a fictional character well it is a cute movie but at the same time it is also a dark very violent movie about two who are out to kill betty for reasons way to complex to recount here either plotline would have been enough on it's own but nurse betty contains both stories at once and the effect is very jarring i didn't much enjoy it
<START> i saw the trailer and read some reviews and i had low expectations for this movie i was pleasantly surprised while the plot is a little off beat everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh the writing and jokes are far more literate than i have come to expect better yet they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job all of them br br the main reasons i wanted to see this movie were justin long and lewis black long is from ed and the new apple computer ads he was just coming into his own as an actor in ed and he was excellent here he's a natural in front of the camera lewis black is a social commentator who pulls no punches he's on the daily show on comedy central about once every two weeks but he really shines in hbo's red white and screwed i regularly catch him on radio's uncensored comedy channel give black an idea and let him improvise whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter he's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst one thing about black's delivery his hand gestures are not those of a comedian it just seems like he's having a conversation with you and i think that makes him unconsciously more effective
<START> this was absolutely one of the best movies i've seen br br excellent performances from a marvelous a list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back br br i couldn't help but care about the characters ms will blow you away as will the young man playing the young lead br br i also thought that the set design was top rate the viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented br br the music is a blast too nice selections to represent mood time and place the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs br br this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings take the time to watch it
<START> i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this of a boring story that seems to go on forever it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks after a heated affair the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways br br the male prostitute then goes on a downward self destructive spiral trying to find his one true love repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love br br in the meanwhile he hooks up with one ugly guy who i thought was also a male prostitute a gay basher and some guy who ends up having a three second sexual intercourse session with him in a back alley br br it never ceases to amaze me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm br br all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them to which he discards their telephone numbers br br there is a brief side plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle there is also another brief side plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window and there is also one more brief side plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person br br none of these things really connect with each other only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is he seems to be living life like a ghost there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world's saddest song on it br br otherwise this movie just seems to go on forever filmed in black and white it may seem very dreamlike but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare br br i found the ending to be confusing as i wasn't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe but seeing as this is an independent film movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to use your imagination br br for those of you who are seeking out nudity there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows in other words don't waste your time with this one br br my rating 2 out of 10
