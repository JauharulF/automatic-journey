<START> i can't believe this movie has 6 stars on imdb this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen that wasn't an episode of mystery science theater 3000 the plot is predictable i couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters the dialog is cheesy several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud including kiefer crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie jeff bridges' accent is goofy i can't tell what country he's supposed to be from it has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers i've ever seen as well after sandra bullock's character disappears absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes i would give this movie a negative amount of stars if i could

<START> i watched this movie because of costas mandylor and lauren holly i adored them together on picket fences so it was a treat to see them together again this was not the best movie ever made but it was cute very predictable but sometimes mindlessly fun movies are just what i need br br the desserts were gorgeous and i wanted to eat all of them i did love it when that one fell apart though i bet it still tasted good br br costas and lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on picket fences and i swooned as they kissed in this movie br br i wouldn't watch this again but it was a great filler for one night
<START> the people who came up with this are sick and twisted freaks how the hell can you exploit people like this tricking people into thinking that this is real which i probably don't doubt that it is i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you should all be ashamed of yourselves i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a real pregnant woman in so much fricken danger you people are bloody animals and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t v if this so called show is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it you all deserve to be friggen hunted down
<START> video vault by shawn k br br my architect a son's journey 2003 nathaniel kahn not rated vault rating 7 br br what a thing to be fatherless my architect a son's journey follows philadelphia filmmaker nathaniel kahn as he desperately seeks answers from his father the renowned architect louis i kahn dead these 30 years br br louis kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family the funeral service when the filmmaker was just a boy was shall we say an unpleasant surprise br br we find that nathaniel only knew his father en from his sporadic visits with his mother whom we are told he loved deeply this movie is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work as if the magnificent structures hold some secret br br to be sure louis kahn was a gifted architect but architect is a cold word the man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art br br among his notable works explored lovingly in the film are the salk institute 1965 the kimball art museum 1972 and the monumental capitol complex in bangladesh 1983 the portion of the film where nathaniel first visits bangladesh finds the work but not the man br br the film benefits greatly from having much footage of the very public man as he worked in new york city and as a professor at yale and the university of pennsylvania many of khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help flesh out the filmmaker's ghost father br br even so the viewer seems not to come to a particularly satisfying place the answers nathaniel khan is looking for seem hollow not good enough br br in scenes where the director meets with his half sisters both from different mothers one can feel the tensions of the years the and hurts one might expect them to burst into anger but only the camera saves them from hostilities each of these children has visibly lost something br br it might be pointed out that khan who seemed a driven perfectionist never became rich instead he became noteworthy it was as if he sacrificed his family for his art this is a crushingly sad and great thing br br april 28 2005
<START> watching quintet is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in portuguese or some other language you do not understand you get the idea that they are playing a game and if you watch closely enough you may just begin to understand the rules but why bother since it is clear you can't join in and you wouldn't want to if you had the chance br br director robert altman is not one to beg an audience to like his films let alone understand them sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd like in m a s h nashville and a wedding films so full of and orchestrated chaos one or two more bodies in the scene wouldn't make much of a difference and other times he seems to resent the fact that someone might even be watching his film as in images or three women where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one altman with quintet altman seems to purposely dare anyone to become involved with the narrative br br you can't depend on altman to do the logical or the expected which is sometimes the thing that makes his films so remarkably iconoclastic but sometimes doing the unexpected isn't daring just dumb for instance in quintet we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person on earth capable of getting pregnant and she is indeed with child this last ray of hope in a decaying society is almost immediately extinguished altman doesn't even wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic tale he lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right off the bat brave maybe stupid definitely devoid of a purpose he tries to build a story on a rapidly melting iceberg all the while reminding us how pointless the effort is br br for the record quintet can at least claim to be prophetic the story is centered on a treacherous game played by the various bored characters it is a form of tag the assassination game a handful of people target each other for elimination each as a would be assassin and each as a would be victim two or more can form alliances to kill a third as they die off new targets are assigned whoever lives wins all of this happens at some exotic inhospitable wasteland it is to a great extent an extreme sci fi version of survivor minus the commercial plugs and faked reality br br it is not a bad concept for a sci fi epic a post apocalyptic setting a microcosm of the world the cast is pointedly multinational a game where no on can be trusted or least not for long and where no one really wins literally a cold war a steely eyed director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day the mystery in quintet is not in the game or how it is played but in why it exists it all if the game quintet is a metaphor for life then altman seems to see nothing in the material but a chance to show life to be an empty meaningless game a conclusion as obvious as it is untrue given the lively albeit cynical nature of the rest of his diverse films i don't believe that altman believes in quintet either and if altman has no faith in his material why should we
<START> camp north star and it's camp counselor extraordinaire harrison bill murray sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival camp mohawk an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend meanwhile we watch as tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor roxanne kate lynch as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head over heels the film comes to head at the camp olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year the film also shows the growing bond between and a quietly lonely puppy dog eyed rudy chris makepeace of vamp fame whose dad is often away all the time rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with or taking his peanuts at blackjack the film mostly contains hi jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around br br you have hottie counselors total nerd spaz jack blum with his taped glasses and bad acne beak nosed hardware matt craven who likes to blow things up fat kid fink keith knight who is often stuffing his face amongst others in the film there's a basketball game where poor spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival camp mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor fink tossing underhanded between his knees fly balls that sail over the back board there's camp fire coupling with a spirited scary tale by about a hook handed killer and boys drooling over the lovely ladies br br yes i know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality such as the scenes with a sad makepeace and murray but just as much as this recent viewing i found myself giggling away i'm licked and just can't help loving this it's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you i can't explain or reinforce enough the overwhelming joy that floods forth when i see a sleepy murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin his jokes are especially amusing but the flick is let's be honest a series of comic vignettes with murray dead panning endlessly not that there's anything wrong with that the film though couldn't quite survive without him could it hard to even think of this movie without murray in the lead it's a happier time and i think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown ups still connect with meatballs warmly and poor morty harvey the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth and to beat camp mohawk for a change is the constant source of and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him especially when he's sleeping on his bed great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us
<START> the curse of monkey island has always been my favorite of the series a vibrant visual look an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice cast all create a memorable and adventure br br graphics wise the game is definitely not a let down though some corners have been cut the over all feel of the game is reminiscent of disney feature length animations the gameplay is simple and even a novice will get the hang of it soon enough the game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its mega monkey mode br br the voice cast is one of my favorites dominic sympathetic voice makes complete and alexandra boyd is simply charming as elaine earl boen makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over the top villain also the game's charm is added by memorable characters like wally neil ross murray denny and one of my personal favorites haggis allan young voice of scrooge mcduck my hat also goes off to the late great kay and his memorable secondary role as griswold br br michael tropical and wonderful soundtrack once more graces the monkey island adventure comprising of some of the best tunes in the business the game isn't perfect and some locales are not as well detailed as other but i had no gripes with the simple ending of the game which i found very satisfying
<START> this film is an almost complete waste of time i am studying the book for my english a level and the film only contributes in one way and that's getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll the acting is wooden the filmography is laughable and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class including me snickering into their texts the book although not my favourite literary choice is miles better than the film is and the sound track is just plain irritating don't watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless quality storyline transformed into mindless media waste
<START> just thinking about the movie i laugh to myself anne ramsey plays an unforgettable part as ' probably the most nasty yet hilarious matriarch ever captured on film danny devito and billy crystal make a fabulous duo bringing a true warmth to the film though not exceedingly complex the cute story holds your attention and keeps you laughing the whole way through it's a fun comedy to lighten things up and even will entertain the kids i give it my full recommendation
<START> i am not a fan of the original book but was expecting to see a better adaptation than the natalie portman movie which i found awful this version is even worse br br first there is very little of ms gregory's book in this script the whole subplot of george sexuality is completely eliminated and in this version george is merely a flunky shuttling between his duty to the boleyn family and his duty to the king i thought the title of the book referred to mary as the lesser known of the boleyn sisters but here it is used to refer to anne br br second the script has the characters periodically address the audience as if in confession apparently this is intended to give a bit of back story and explain their motives but it is amateurish in execution br br on top of the bad script the direction is stunningly bad there are too many shots done with a circling camera which is none too steady at best and downright shaky at worst several of the speeches are delivered tentatively as if in a first rehearsal the production values for henry's flamboyant court are minimal the costumes vary some are copies of historical portraits and others are from some costume designer's fevered imagination and the king the source of all power and favors is often shown alone no fawning courtiers no servants in the background where are all the people i am accustomed to hollywood turning history into fantasy but i expected better from a bbc production even based on a flawed book this production is bad
<START> this show drives me crazy it goes against everything a family should be even if it is intended to be a comedy the show is suppose to follow dave and vicky gold michael rapaport and anita barone as they raise their three teenage children hilary larry and mike a good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show br br i don't think i've ever heard cruder talk from parents to children and vice versa the only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex i know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it the one episode i was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter hilary a car not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how hilary is like their slave br br the show fails on the comedy level the most i haven't laughed at this show once in the numerous times i have attempted to watch it and i'm a person who gave such films as animal house and dumb and dumber very high marks michael rapaport is a very good actor and why he choose to ruin his career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me br br parents make sure your children never and i mean never watch this teenagers you'll probably get a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references but nothing comes out of it and afterwards you feel rather empty br br 1 1 2 5 stars
<START> due to this show getting cut early i never realized why until i recently read the story behind the series i felt this show never got its dues as one of the greatest shows this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original a team cast at least with the cast incorporated into the story line or a lengthy cameo perhaps at the end commemorate it to the late col smith this cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last heave ho the fact that the series ended openly because they slashed the series is reason enough this crew and cast made us realize as children the essence of being one of the good guys especially seeing how screwed up the world is today i think a milder version like the original should be put into motion i have already read the previews and i know these are not the plans but if anything a straight to dvd movie i sure would buy it i really do not get how crappy shows get series finales but this great show which still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage shows of today don't we will always remember the incredible hulk series knight rider airwolf and the a team because those kind of shows carry through time i am almost positive these knew ones you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years so why not bring back something and show the people what staying power is all about and how these old shows really are all about
<START> i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this it seems to be divided into two parts action sequences and personal dramas ashore it follows ashton through survival swimmer school guided by master chief kevin costner then to alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place the last resulting in death br br i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast guardsmen puddle pirates the experienced old timer costner who is as an elderly bar tender tells him married to the coast guard the older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen the neglected ex wife ashore to whom kostner pays a farewell visit the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors all in pursuit of a loftier goal the gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past br br the problem is that we've seen it all before if it's kevin costner here it's clint eastwood or john wayne or lou jr or vigo mortenson or robert deniro elsewhere and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from the perfect storm and dead calm none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality br br it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of instruction it's mostly personal conflict romance and tension about washing out br br it's a shame because the u s coast guard is rather a noble outfit its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles in world war ii the coast guard even managed to have a medal of honor winner in its ranks br br but again we don't learn much about that we don't really learn much about anything the film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else a disappointment
<START> first a word of caution the dvd box describes this film as a comedy i don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons while light and a little bit funny in places it is not a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed br br i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big disappointments i was so happy when i saw this film the acting writing and direction were excellent the story itself definitely interested me as you don't usually see films about the final month of france before the nazi takeover in 1940 it gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to their beloved country along the way there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by isabelle adjani who looks marvelous after all these years she kills an ex lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall this sap escapes from prison and finds her with another lover a high government official and weasel played by gerard depardieu in addition a subplot about a jewish physicist trying to smuggle out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot the story has a lot of nice twists and turns a light sense of humor without trying to be a comedy and some genuine suspenseful moments together they create a nice package this is sure to please
