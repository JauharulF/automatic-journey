<START> my wife and i saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again it was so moving that i was calling it a tear jerker the mystery that billings was sent to report on is really no mystery at all angles it seems that ever time he turned around something happened to him all good and i believe it scared george a bit considering that he did not realize what he had gotten into it just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around if only we all could treat each other the same the world would be a better place to date we have been searching the net for a copy of it now i finally have a connection to it as soon as i can find a copy to buy i am going to grab it
<START> i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a pic here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film br br all mexican women are super hot remember that little desert town in unearthed yeah well this must be it's mexican sister city don't even bother with the hookers just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well br br half of mexico is controlled by insane satan worshiping palo cultists the other half as everyone here in the u s knows is run by drug dealers fortunately this doesn't much interfere with the sex trade and our ultra low wage factories down there br br mexican cops are useless don't go to them go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your vanished friend she'll be way more help than the cops br br when you're being gruesomely tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists don't go reciting the psalms or any part of the bible really you'll just mess up the mojo
<START> i'm a huge fan of legendary director elia kazan his movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses be it obsessive love in 'splendor in the grass poverty in a tree grows in brooklyn or racism in gentlemen's agreement while looking for other movies made by kazan i stumbled across a movie that was based on a novel by arthur miller the movie called focus stars william h macy who happens to be one of my favorite actors and laura dern it deals with anti semitism in a very realistic way br br macy's character seems to go along with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his job until it affects him personally that's the key here the reason he acted wasn't because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand he acted because he was now considered an outsider and he began to experience the same looks the same remarks and the same brutally that mr david experienced br br the movie is very well written and well acted meat loaf does a awesome job of playing a dirt bag both macy and dern's performances are outstanding it's easier in life to go along with instead of going against sometimes in order for people to take a stand things have to impact their lives or the lives of their loved ones only then will some find their moral compass
<START> i saw this movie once a long time ago just once and i didn't know where it had come from and i looked for about six years to find it and i finally found it here at imdb com just the whole concept of the movie is great i believe it's got something to do with a race of beings keeping tabs on us and our planet but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity and the way that he does it to keep himself from being tracked and located is what keeps the movie entertaining i don't remember exactly how it ended but i remember it finished with a great climax and a good twist
<START> this is the first film i've watched from the italian ed wood demofilo fidani aka miles deem the above title was added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring richard which was hammer films' michael one and only stab at the western the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam but they called him it was actually wallach in the italian variant which of course implies a tribute of sorts to hollywood actor eli br br while certainly not unwatchably bad instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that i was often cracking up into howls of laughter a horrid number by a would be irresistible french chanteuse a totally irrelevant bar room brawl actors doing somersaults when being shot an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine ineffective use indeed abuse of slow motion and easily the most preposterous seeing gordon mitchell and lincoln tate play two gunfighters sporting the actors' own names hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all br br lead actor robert woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the over the bodies of his victims supporting actress actually the director's own daughter as the villain's broad is quite a looker but unfortunately she doesn't get to do much in the film Â despite having a change of heart towards the end the main musical theme is actually pretty good but again the title song is in itself quite lousy
<START> although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books it is in my opinion a great movie it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book but to be fair he would not look good with blond hair and lestat is most definitely about looking good he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would have br br the visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing it's not interview with the vampire so don't try to compare the two interview is louis' story this is a cut and paste version of in any case i highly recommend
<START> this should have been a short film nothing more the length of 1 5 hours is much too long because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke it's getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie br br to do yourself a favor don't mention to see that movie
<START> seeing as how i am a big fan of both fall and if lucy fell i came to with high expectations i am not sure i could have been more disappointed this had it all weak dialogue weak performances you name it i was let down oh well better luck next time eric
<START> i think the title of the movie describes it well if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work you'll have to look somewhere else although some of that is covered in this film br br of course i eat up pretty much anything i'm fed and i don't know much of the family history revolving around this case so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father etc br br for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a player br br this really is a journey through someone's life and i was happy to tag along for the experience a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well br br oh and the footage of some of kahn's work is stunning
<START> i'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can't be accused of unfair bias with absolutely no cause the cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white foreign tourist they picked a 15 yr old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him in addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager it makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged imprisoned and subsequently found innocent this docudrama is well produced professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you won't want to take a 1 minute break if you care about social justice don't miss this one it certainly deserved its oscar
<START> the story is about a psychic woman tory who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past the death of her childhood friend and abusive father tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders br br you really don't need to find out because oh my god this was so so so so bad i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching but do not be fooled the ending was predictable the acting terrible don't even get me started about the southern accents y'all and the story was trite just remember you were warned
<START> this move is absolutely most certainly one of the greatest films of its or any other genre kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten 2001 a space odyssey is a journey unlike anything i have ever seen on the screen kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development just with visuals along 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying 10 out of 10 no doubt for my money it doesn't get much better than 2001 a space oddysey now the sequel 2010 that's a different story
<START> shame on you if you give this film a low rating how can you not like a film that has doug mcclure peter cushing silly rubber monsters fights and for the guys that woman that was the henchwoman in the spy who loved me and one of the seventies sinbad films not wearing very much of whom my mother said she wasn't picked for the colour of her eyes lava silly wigs and a daft victorian drilling machine very much like the one used in the old thunderbirds series whoever watched this film and slagged it off was watching it for the wrong reasons it may be crap but is definitely good crap they don't make 'em like they used to sigh
<START> 80's sleazy glam rock is like 90's house music or current it's boring and has no ideas or ideals the only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago so we can laugh at its too bad 'rock star' has no laughs at all as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years br br chris mark wahlberg is singer of a steel dragon tribute band when he's kicked of the band at the same time the real steel dragon singer is kicked of as well he becomes the next lead singer you already know how this is gonna end up at that time with chris losing it with sex drugs and r r and forgetting about his long time girlfriend manager emily jennifer aniston br br there's way too much boring music in this standard formula packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost watch the over rated but still more fun almost famous instead or even better a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions that thing you do br br what a stinker 2 10
<START> a train holding union soldiers is transporting 300 000 of gold along with a banker clayton who's there to see it reaches its destination but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit however nicks off with the gold and hides it but when tries to get it out of him he's killed by soldiers the only clue is that of a medallion but is captured and soon would be executed a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by who after the bounty of and offers to save his life for half of the gold in exchange gives him half of the medallion but clayton notices it and discovers something is up soon all three are crossing each other for the gold but also the bank's insurance company and gang are watching on waiting for their chance to pounce br br just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue in cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references some nicely realised from other films largely the dollar trilogy of its sub genre director enzo sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight but there's potential in many of his grand showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace largely there's a lot of tussles fist fights and plenty of acrobatic stunts taking place compared with all out vicious shootouts however most of these stunts are very well done and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn the traditional story sticks close to conventional details but since there's a lot of conniving and going on the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments clever twists and plenty of wink wink the humour within the script is pretty sly worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style is giovanni dynamically taut framing and francesco de impulsively rousing music score the performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport george hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger gilbert roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable mexican bandit edd byrnes gives a poised performance as clayton that holds up well kareen o'hara doesn't get much to do but is a worthy looker gerard pedro sanchez and provide able support br br a fun and worthy spaghetti parody homage that throws one curve ball after another and many fruitful down 'n' dirty antics
