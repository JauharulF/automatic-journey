<START> being an avid carpenter fan i really loved this film although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired and agree with many of the comments that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on whatever it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied so off i went to discover more i must recommend a book by ray coleman carpenters the untold story the book is an intelligent read and unlike the film is 'real' and down to earth i hope you enjoy it i remember cynthia from her days in fame and gypsy she is a singer aswell as dancer in her own right and i think this was the edge needed to create the character some other actresses may have struggled with this it is ashame the film did not delve deeper into her story after all this is the film title but i felt we learnt more about richard but i suppose like any performer worth their salt you should always leave them wanting more
<START> i've just finished seeing the film for the first time in it's entirety although i watched some parts when it was first shown in britain in the mid 90's i truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late twentieth century cinema a film of this scope raises lots of questions like why are there some narrative differences between the 60's hermann in and hermann in this film for example in the first film hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather he funds hermann's electronic music whereas in die there is little mention of his dad until the final episode br br one other point does interest me reading up on edgar i'm struck by historical similarities between him and the stefan character spoiler coming in the last episode it is revealed that stefan has won a prize at the venice film festival won an award for best debut work there for his film film company is called and stefan's is also eponymously named i'm interested in stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from helga he is probably the least likable of the friends br br maybe stefan's a red herring i don't know what i do know is that i loved this film and wish that more were made like it with the exception of michael haneke's cache and werner herzog's grizzly man there's not enough ambition audacity and passion of this sort in modern cinema i can't wait to see number 3 now
<START> i rented this movie but i wasn't too sure what to expect of it i was very glad to find that it's about the best brazilian movie i've ever seen the story is rather odd and simple and above all extremely original we have antonio who is a young man living in a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of brazil and who is deeply in love with the main conflict between the two is that while antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it wants to see the world and resents the place as a prove of his love for her he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her he'll put in the map as he says and the way he does it is unbelievable this is a good movie might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job but i think that it's also that that improves the story it's just fun and it makes you feel good
<START> was a big disappointment for me i'd heared how great it was how important it was it just didn't strike me it had a dim witted story line plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are offensive by today's standards while most of d w griffith's films have depth and this one feels more like a formula programme picture br br i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in pre birth of a nation roles plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good to future griffith cameraman karl brown audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end i felt nothing and me i watching griffith's early work at biograph this film just isn't what it used to be br br the best thing about this film it that for all of it's flaws it has many of griffith's touches to it he handles his principal actors pretty well plus the scene where the indians are the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later
<START> this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it my wife has never seen it and when i just rewatched it last night i waited until after she went to bed she might have been amused by a couple small snippets but i know she would have had enough within ten minutes br br head has nothing like a conventional story the film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres if you're not a big fan of those things psychedelia surrealism postmodernism and the acid trip aesthetic assuming there's a difference between them you should probably stay away from this film on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff you need to run out and buy head now if you haven't already br br oddly the film has never received much respect that probably has a lot to do with preconceptions after all it does star the monkees micky dolenz davy jones michael and peter and the monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob and bert schneider to be a kid friendly bubble gummy beatles for a television series in their era they had as much respect as say new kids on the block the spice girls and so on as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notes perhaps people in 1968 thinking of the monkees as a silly factory made pop band rip off of the beatles refused to see head br br the monkees and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception it's a shame because there was a lot of talent both musically and otherwise in the monkees it's probably odder that who directs here and co produces with schneider and jack nicholson yes that jack nicholson who wrote the script and also co produces decided to take the monkees in this unusual direction it's as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink floyd's 1969 or atom heart mother 1970 in fact the songs in head written by the monkees and frequent collaborators such as carole king and harry nilsson have a floyd like quality somewhere between the syd barrett era and the immediate post barrett era this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity some people have complained about the music in the film but to me all the songs are gems for that matter some people dislike barrett era or other floyd which is just as difficult for me to empathize with br br but what is head about the basic gist is just that the monkees are taking a trip through various film genres there are war scenes adventure scenes horror scenes comedy scenes drama scenes western scenes sci fi scenes romance scenes and on and on except in the film's reality this turns out to be happening primarily if not exclusively on a studio lot at root we're watching the monkees shoot a film of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self referential about them and they and individual shots within a scene tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the monty python television show as a dream head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep something that i frequently do by the way br br technically uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above there are scenes with extensive negative images there are a lot of very fast cuts including a great sequence that features davy jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each that occasionally back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time there are a lot of bizarre segues there is an animated cow mouth there are odd editing devices and so on for my money i wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era this is the kind of artistic approach i relish it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think it's a good idea i'd like to see films like the life aquatic with steve using 2004 using these types of extended techniques now that would make that film surreal br br some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b s to offer meanings for something intended to not have any i disagree with such a pessimistic nihilistic view head was intended to have a lot of meaning s and it's not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations nicholson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the monkees the film comments on their manufactured status pop stardom way before pink floyd head pop stardom and violence from images of war to images of fans dismantling their idols and naÃ¯ve u s oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect well armed foreigners in a desert surrender to micky dolenz just because he's an american then later they blow up a coke machine again in the desert for him because he's thirsty and can't gain access the film comments on many other topics from big industry to police surveys especially in relation to tragedies and on and on head is full of ideas appropriately enough with intelligent multifaceted things to say about them br br head deserves to be considered a classic it's basically shooting for the same vibe as the beatles' yellow submarine both premiered in november of 1968 interestingly enough and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic yellow submarine wasn't quite successful head is everything yellow submarine should have been
<START> what can i say you expect only the best in drama from the bbc and messiah is not an exception to the rule br br messiah is a great thriller a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons police officer red metcalfe ken and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events before more lives are lost br br but be warned despite it's rating in the uk messiah is a bit of a gruesome film some of the murder scenes are similar to those in se7en and one or two can be really stomach churning but if you can withstand that sit back in your chair and enjoy although you'll most likely be on the edge of it or hiding behind it br br rated by the bbfc for moderate violence and strong horror
<START> for the main criticisms of the movie the love story that wasn't a love story those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy it added a feminine touch but come on look at american movies no where close to love story there was no storyline does war have a storyline i think that is a silly criticism the storyline is this they start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died death is the ultimate end to any story just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline br br there was a horrid truth in this movie i wouldn't necessarily call it anti war it had a political statement of course but the movie wasn't all about the politics in fact except for a few occurrences when the captain showed up there was never a stifling air of nazi germany they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party the fat cats weren't gonna go into russia br br maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier i'd say exactly of almost any nationality and war and what they must go through it was a losing battle of course the movie is going to be depressing and to the person who said that it was gutsy and silly to even portray germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war any real soldier will tell you that br br this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary a few problems with it when arguing for just one but it instills the best of both worlds watch it as such beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically emotionally br br i'm waiting til they make a movie about iraq it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial i want to see who has the guts to do it first jarhead doesn't count
<START> from the start this film drags and drags clumsy overdubs explaining the history monochrome acting boring sets total lack of any humanity verve or style the actors look as if they are drugged potentially an interesting story completely wasted surely somebody realised how bad it was at some point in producing it
<START> i just saw mar and felt that i had to comment on this film euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie many people have raved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery camera work certainly javier bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes to say that he encompasses the real is a little silly since i don't think that any of the reviewers have known personally to lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't constitute a 'perfect' performance bardem just does what he does well and that's it the camera work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death now i'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia the problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it the movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter i find it a weakness for the movie unintentionally portrays as a character someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't get the double layered poem directed towards him someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is a scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the wrong choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that choice was the right one the woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by when she agrees to help him die these choices make into a calculated figure no matter how charming bardem portrays him i would say it doesn't convince fully and i kinda think that amenabar didn't intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film for a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments the discussion between the priest and for instance the camera work is impressive and the film is well acted but 10 out of 10 no the movie doesn't reach that excellence
<START> being a former mst3k watcher even i found this movie unwatchable the awful attempts at humor heck the awful attempts at acting nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk br br i just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends just click on their other reviews and wow they are all reviewing modern vampires give me a couple of bucks and i can make a movie better than this one of the most incompetent pieces of film making i've ever seen and that's saying something watch at your own risk br br rating 0 10
<START> i'm grading this film on a curve in other words it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do this is an excellent t a film i have no idea the count of how many t's or a's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare t's at one time just to give you an idea there are topless girls all throughout there is a wet t shirt contest scene and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes i don't know why this gets such a low rating here perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones if you are looking for a good campy t a film i'd recommend this one
<START> dolemite is the touching story of dolemite gotta love blaxploitation film titles an ex con who probably should still be in jail he gets in trouble with cops friends drug dealers women prostitutes and society in general he's just not that likable a guy neither is the movie though it's still hilarious and worth watching br br the flimsy premise is that dolemite played with as much enthusiasm as star rudy ray moore can muster is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit when a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down the warden releases him to stop it or help it or just watch it not very clear all i know is that i was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence my ignorance i guess br br the plot is convoluted and unimportant basically dolemite goes around killing people usually with very poorly choreographed karate having sex and cursing out people sometimes even rhyming too the joys of the movie are its total incompetence and its total indifference in the matter br br i stopped counting the number of times i saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration about two minutes of film i stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where dolemite was sitting even after he stood up and walked around when they cut back to the establishing shot and dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again i stopped wondering why dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly read normal clothes the jail gave him and i stopped wondering where he learned karate when he his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open the only time i was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up you keep saying cut away cut away cut away but by the time they do you are already emotionally scarred br br the movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable moore as dolemite is either funny cool or both if you're on the lookout for a bad movie you have found it with dolemite
<START> this is only the fourth effort iâve watched from this director whom i met and found quite genial at the 2004 venice film festival italian b movie retrospective and also possibly the worst as was the case with the bronx executioner 1989 which preceded it this is a prime example from the tail end of the euro cult era â prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time br br here in fact we get a plot revolving around â iâm not kidding folks â a killer phone pretty but bland charlotte lewis â in her third film after pirates 1986 and the golden child 1986 â is a model who apparently has just ended an affair she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but every time the phone rings all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond or some such crap she befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who conveniently knows of an authority on paranormal activity william berger â who hilariously explains that the negative energy which is unleashed say during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force i swear i making this up br br among the highlights er lowpoints of the film are the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times it seems that the chain of events can only be broken by having lewis go through her paces again exterminating angel 1962 style the sheer variety of preposterous looking phones on display the apparatus of the photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill the sarcastic cop who greets lewis on reporting the strange occurrences whatâs the toaster up to i wonder the would be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth and own bloody demise with the phone affecting the heâs fitted with and causing the heart to explode br br the filmâs climax is rather confusing and apparently finally sees all the inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the office a service for what itâs worth the score â by ex goblin claudio no less â is effective enough despite the inclusion of dated heavy metal numbers on the soundtrack
<START> if you read the plot summary for mad max you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film you've also found out that mad max takes place in post apocalyptic australia which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on the film made in 1979 tries really hard to be stanley kubrick's a clockwork orange 1971 only that film in all its strangeness actually makes sense and leaves an impact this film does neither and ends up being a car bike stunt filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does br br the first thing wrong with mad max is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes if the first hour were condensed to 20 30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that mad max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist instead mel gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2 3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge i've yet to watch the sequel road warrior and i have to admit i'm excited for it only because i want to know what he does next this first film was mostly a waste of time br br george miller does some great action stuff here but his over the top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments its a terribly clichÃ© b movie technique br br there is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think a great action sci fi movie at least makes a point but the gratuitous violence done by random weird bikers doesn't say anything of value even the villain feels modeled off alex of clockwork only uglier and completely unimposing the pg violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer it just cheeses it up if anything br br i'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later i'm just crossing my fingers road warrior will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends otherwise that's more time wasted steven c br br visit my site at http moviemusereviews blogspot com
<START> latter days for me was a very moving film it showed just how hard and disrespected the gay community really is the film true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters the film holds a real depth of compassion for the gay community as it really speaks out for the gay man woman personally i think it's about high time that the homosexual community of all religions should no longer hold there head in shame just for being there beautiful self the film was very much of a eye opener for me as i could not believe how anti homosexual this world really is even at schools if a kid dislikes something they will refer to it as being gay i real hope that more film like this one are made and that they are not just labelled as a gay film but as a love story as i believe that gay directors should stick up for themselves and tell their story through their eyes
