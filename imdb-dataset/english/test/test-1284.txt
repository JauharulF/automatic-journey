<START> good movie great story great characters i enjoyed it immensely enough to buy the dvd when it came out br br the real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the could ever come up with my friend who is in the media business said they shouldn't show insider dealings like this it gives the business a bad name as if br br there are a few problems with the dvd though first the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the tv volume to watch it i notice that its also like that when hbo runs it so its in the original production copy second for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side after the five minutes it fills the screen properly left to right sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and i don't know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by br br still even with the technical flaws its an enjoyable story one of hbo's best i think
<START> i loved this thing the most wonderful thing about pink flamingos is that it strives desperately to be in horrible taste but has really gained a cult following world wide says a lot about us us being people doesn't it pink flamingos succeeds because waters made the film he wanted to make a film need not be disgusting to succeed but it may be when you watch this film you see things that are disgusting but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed what we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist be it in film or any other media should watch this film
<START> aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat this film rings true on the chaos of the post war br br beautiful photography and a powerful national expression of the polish national character br br it's very slow at points but its entire pacing is so different from american and western european films that it's quite refreshing br br both lead actors do a very good job on the dvd version you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew and the lead actress has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty but in 1970 she was a stunner
<START> this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me everything i hate about films is present fake sentimentality extreme corniness bad child actors and more feature abundantly that's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of american sports fans with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon what that's a rugby ball the story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like who coincidently teaches the class in a short skirt and gets them interested in football naturally they're all rubbish don't forget they're no hopers except for one kid who has moved from el paso blah blah etc etc and the kids still don't become good but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well rounded kids hell even the adults start to come round drunks are turned into caring parents illegal immigrants are let off the hook groan br br this movie stars steve guttenberg now before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy hold up a minute guttenberg is rubbish no no come on let's face it how did this guy ever get to be in a movie i have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea olivia d'abo stars along side steve and doesn't impress either she merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it although i have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this most of them are disgusting and or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all there's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat so don't bother seeing this movie
<START> years ago i didn't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now i noticed that many of cagney's films done with warner brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle however the more i watched these films the more i found i was hooked despite these aspects in fact i now kind of like and expect them fans of old time hollywood films probably understand what i am saying teens and other young whippersnappers don't well when it comes to entertainment the mayor of hell never lets up from start to finish while the idea of a shady character like cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous and while all the changes he made also seemed far fetched it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment br br the gang of tough thugs were pre dead end kids and instead of the likes of leo gorcey huntz hall and billy similar roles are played here by frankie and farina yes i did say farina this black actor was already famous for his roles in the our gang comedies and was believe it or not one of the highest paid child actors in hollywood all he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical negro here he actually was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual however some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving farina and his dad fred with awful names like farina and snowflake don't say i didn't warn you br br apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe the film is exceptional and fun the kids do a great job as does cagney and dudley digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden also as an added plus you get to see perennial warner stock actor allen jenkins in his first role for the studio
<START> all i can say is that each time i see dir martin ritt dp john alonzo i feel an utmost sense of inspiration and in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film br br the motion picture is set in 1969 it is based on a true story it is a story about a white man jon voight who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside of their little south carolina island br br the story places the job of a teacher as noble cause in changing children's lives br br i highly recommend it
<START> shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours considering how hideous he looks and his personality it isn't surprising that he can't get a taker that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new hubby plus the money of course br br while i don't hate the three stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion they never even on their best day came close to the brilliant comedy of buster keaton that's why i disliked this film as it was a ripoff of the plot from keaton's masterpiece seven chances with the stooges it wasn't uncommon for columbia pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle older stooge shorts so from the outset this film is a pale imitation of an original it's also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced the phone booth scene the cousin basil bit however was pretty cute and funny though far from subtle however the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion in the keaton version hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious here it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch ending in a fizzle br br overall a dull retread also before marking this review not helpful be sure to first see seven chances to see what i am talking about then you decide
<START> great show about time a reality tv show comes along that closes generation gaps contestants range in ages some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out and others looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them grease has truly become an american icon grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to you're the one that we want is sure to gain even more grease followers the only thing i wish there had been more of is character history then again it is kind of nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50's cant wait to watch the next show and then on broadway
<START> i don't think the world was ready for this film i know i wasn't i'd been expected a standard low budget schlock exploitation potboiler instead i got the most intelligent reworking of shakespeare since peter greenaway's prospero's books this should become the definitive film version of romeo and juliet it won't of course but that's the world's loss
<START> i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or tearing it to pieces i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to lightly the film is art house science fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be spoon fed a plot and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow no the film is just terrible as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot line avoid
<START> in 1990 i saw kathy ireland in person i was at in denton during the filming of necessary roughness strangely enough the voice she's using in this film isn't too far off from her real speaking voice br br anyway the plot goes like this kathy gets a letter telling her that her father's fallen into a bottomless pit in africa she goes and investigates the site of her father's death only to get sucked into a subterranean world that's part dystopian nightmare part uninspiring fantasy and inhabited by rejects from the this movie really wastes the talent of linda who in my opinion could have been someone had she gotten that one big role that was right for her anyway the main hero of the story gus is a very lame mark jacko jackson rip off the original is annoying enough to begin with but this guy really is torture to watch eventually the nebbish wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a at the end if you're going to have kathy ireland in a film in skimpy clothing it'd better be a bikini anyway the film was just all around bad and rightfully skewered by mst3k br br avoid this one if possible
<START> this one reeler produced by mgm in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young stars under contract judy garland and deanna durbin in a way these short films were promotional trailers that featured new talent in front or behind the camera felix feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public br br the story is simple enough the orchestra that entertains in a public park every sunday doesn't get the attention it deserves enter two music aficionados judy and edna who love to hear the band play conducted by one of their grandfathers two of the town's elders sensing there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience br br the two girls embark in a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know calling and running errands and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise they will attend the park concert next sunday well that day comes and to their surprise hardly anyone comes as the music starts the two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing the result is clear people all over the park flocks to hear the talented young singers thus ensuring the orchestra's existence br br of course the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing by the two stars who are wonderful in their rendition ms durbin's operatic voice blends well with ms garland's natural one creating a lovely duet br br don't miss it whenever it shows on tcm
<START> chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war the rain the mud the explosions all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all he's in france for one thing to fight the germans something he does with unbelievable success br br it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin a very funny one at that until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense br br perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war
<START> babs johnson divine lives in a trailer with her son crackers her daughter cotton and her mother edie edie massey she's in competition with a couple named connie and raymond marbles mink stole david to be named the filthiest person alive the film shows their attempts to outdo each other br br this film is very much not for everyone it's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches the marbles pick up female hitchhikers impregnate them keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc it's disgusting but in a way not unwatchable it's so over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating as director john waters might say it's bad taste done well also it's kind of amusing to watch the acting is so wretched especially by massey that you just watch it in disbelief a friend laughed out loud at how bad massey was she improved in later pictures br br this is not for people who are easily offended even though it's over 30 years old it's still shocking however if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must see the only part that really was too much is what divine does at the very end
<START> i have to admit that out of the many many thriller movies i have seen this has to be one of the worst i was shocked to discover that this piece of work had a 1 5 mil budget when it started i thought that the opening sequence was pretty good fairly standard for this kind of film but pretty good anyway but as the film progressed i began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing each sequence seemed to take hours the reason for this could have been that by now the film had already bored me to tears nothing was happening other than endless accusations peppered with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fit of bad temper well after wading through what felt like a lifetime of these scenes we finally reached the big finale an all singing all dancing demonstration of how lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good film br br overall i found this movie predictable and tedious and i would not recommend this film to anyone other than those people i personally dislike but if you have a couple of hours to waste and you want to watch a thriller that is not even remotely scary this is the movie for you
