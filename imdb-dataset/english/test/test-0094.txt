<START> why jessie matthews one of britains top musical stars was in this movie in between her sparkling the good companions and the classic evergreen is a good question when i first saw it i was really disappointed i wanted to see her sing and dance she was billed as millie the non stop variety girl but there was more stop than variety br br now i see it as a good little drama br br it is about a bus crash and the stories leading up to it of the people on the bus br br apart from jessie matthews who is great as millie sir ralph richardson plays her fiancÃ©e yes that's right br br edmund gwenn who went to hollywood to co star in lassie movies and also with natalie wood in miracle on 34th street plays a grumpy businessman gordon harker is his very annoying partner br br williams who wrote night must fall was the black mailing villain and frank lawton who went to hollywood and appeared in david copperfield and the devil doll is the young man in trouble sonnie hale who was married to jessie matthews at the time played the bus conductor
<START> this was an excellent show it came on pbs back home in chicago and i remember cindy from played the teen aged daughter the show dealt with subjects such as sex peer pressure and puberty it was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from oakland or somewhere i can't remember i remember several episodes but the one i remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time i was probably 7 8 when i first watched it and i was able to keep up with the program this was a great show i can't remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show but i always got him confused with kevin hooks
<START> the real star of the last of the airport films is that big supersonic carrier the french created called the concorde if you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky than the whole film kind of makes sense br br but if you're expecting some serious drama here than by all means take some of the evasive action the concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down br br susan blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon robert wagner one of wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of wagner's dirty business dealings selling arms to folks not friendly to the usa when the source macon is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit man whom she escapes from of course she confronts wagner with the information and of course he denies it but right before blakely boards the concorde widow kathleen maguire hands her the necessary documents br br but on the way to moscow with a stop in paris wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down but the fearless crew of alain delon david warner and george kennedy is up to all their tricks it's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film br br if you're an aviation enthusiast you absolutely won't care about the plot it's like the film le mans with steve mcqueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item maybe le mans is better at that because they just didn't bother with any kind of story br br among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by jimmie walker a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child played by cicely tyson and martha raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from washington to paris in the loo she's actually the best one here br br robert wagner must have been psychic though because i'm sure on the strength of this film he got the part of doctor number two in the austin powers series br br i'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film but it seems to have killed the airport saga of movies
<START> watching this ppv i had high expectations for it since smackdown is the best show in wwe this is a very good ppv as it is the last one before wrestlemania br br first match hardy boys chris benoit vs mvp mnm w melina in a 6 man tag team match good way to start the match it started a bit slow at the start but later the pace quickened the match got more exciting entertaining benoit rolls through makes joey mercury tap out to get a victory for the hardy boys himself 6 10 br br second match gregory helms champion vs shannon moore vs vs chavo guerrero vs vs scotty 2 hotty vs jamie noble vs jimmy wang yang in an open cruiserweight match for the wwe cruiserweight championship i'm a very big fan of i never get disappointed watching them especially in this match here chavo guerrero nails the frog splash on jimmy wang yang to get the win become the new wwe cruiserweight champion 5 10 br br third match finlay little bastard vs boogeyman little boogeyman this was not really a wrestling match it was more like a comedy match despite not being a clear wrestling contest it still entertained me with the funny antics finlay nails the little boogeyman with the to get the win boogeyman does not deserve to be on a ppv does not deserve to be in wwe 4 10 br br fourth match kane vs king booker w this was a surprisingly good match i thought it would be mediocre but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest hats off to both men pulling a very entertaining match kane wins after a chokeslam on king booker 6 10 br br fifth match paul london brian kendrick champions vs deuce domino w cherry for the wwe tag team championships not really that much of a good match deuce domino need more training to wrestle london kendrick are the only ones keeping this match fast paced london kendrick retain their titles after kendrick gets a roll up on one of the guys for the win 4 10 br br sixth match bobby lashley champion vs mr kennedy for the ecw championship mr kennedy attacks lashley from behind before the match starts it was an okay match but not really good lashley kennedy have a bit of chemistry but not enough to pull a great match kennedy wins by dq after lashley nails him with a chair then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area lashley still retains his title 4 10 br br seventh match john cena shawn michaels vs batista undertaker this is probably the greatest tag team match that i have ever seen hats off to all of these men yes even batista for pulling off as close as a 5 star main event classic all 4 of these men played their parts in the match very well as this was a very great entertaining tag team match batista turns his back on undertaker spine busting him then leaving the ring which prompts michaels to nail sweet chin music then cena to nail an f u for the hard fought victory 7 10 br br i don't know why everyone says that this ppv is not good enough or it is boring i just don't get it it is a great ppv which smackdown always delivers a great ppv indeed br br overall i'll give it 8 10 a b
<START> on many levels it's very good in fact considering that this was a low budget british indie by a first time feature director with a largely neophyte cast it's a magnificent achievement i don't know how much it cost the figure of Â£8 000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is the point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that great special effects terrific production design effective props and costumes excellent photography good acting and direction an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix even having said that much of the script was great the characters were clearly identified and all had something to do this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless faceless blanks but these were ten characters mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things throughout the middle act when the plot was developing the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters if the whole film was like the second act it would be stunning br br before the ship blows up twelve people make it to individual escape pods or which blast away from the ship they're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped cramped and have no real idea where they're going but that makes sense i like the e pods they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice roomy escape capsule i also like the way that we are specifically told later that they are designed for ship to ship escape but can just about make in an emergency because let's face it these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet that said it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused e pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e pod but in he gets and it has just occurred to me shouldn't the captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there anyway the e pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation or at least on a sandy sparsely part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere nah it's a planet in a sci fi movie it will be exactly the same all over we have to accept that all the e pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up firing flares into the sky to locate each other br br the captain a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent decides that they should try and contact 'captain with whom they were intending to rendezvous but they cannot do this from the planet they need to get into orbit the engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere it can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal the captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat repaired e pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team that's kid i really liked the way that he now points out that his name is david and the captain starts using it treating him with dignity and respect that was good storytelling and good characterisation
<START> with a humor that would appeal to an exclusive small audience the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous when cartoon network advertised this show it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep br br when it came out on the air i was disappointed at how all the characters were so one dimensional and a totally bland animation the only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like private public and general specific a few vague references to cultural aspects and how lady pummeled sheep with her steel wig br br slightly off topic but i don't see why would sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called swanky it was hideous
<START> this typical teenagers movie is one of the best beside the story is good the music is well accompany the movie all along br br although i do not enjoy classic movie unless it is classic and better written script this one is exceptional maybe the hair style and language should be change a bit in the 80's i believe offensive language is still rarely heard br br
<START> extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from ok they have different names and initial situations but the actors are the same gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts the depiction of the fighting parties as faceless authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to orwell's 1984 even if bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war that is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards eva's and jan's marriage are relevant and essential while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was covered with before an intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions
<START> deep water 2006 br br it is indifferent it's there waiting for you to make one slip up those words paraphrased are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean i have ever heard muttered its furies are boundless not least of which her loneliness those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary deep water it is the story of donald an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 sunday times race around the world if you do not know his story it may be best to stop reading now don't read this or any other information on or the race find the film and just watch it br br after the first solo of the ocean in 1967 adventurers and watchers of adventurers began seeking the next one up this time the journey would have to be done without making landfall or stopping along the way having fallen on hard times saw the race as a great chance to get his family back on their feet he had lived through financial hardships as a child and wanted part in going back to such a life so he set out to find sponsors and soon did in stanley best and rodney the two men spelled the potential cash cow and granted a boat on the condition that if he should pull out of the race he would be forced himself to pay the expenses his boat however was in serious need of repairs and he feared it would not be ready in time for the final departure day he was informed however by his that he simply must go Â after all they up the dough and expected it back many a time over br br the details of the story are infamous boat began taking on water and his progress slowed to a crawl faced with the decision of trying to round the horn of africa certain death in such a boat or turn back financial devastation and he searched for a third option he chose to hide out alone on his yacht waiting for other competitors to round cape horn in south america from there he would rejoin the race he reported false positions and record breaking speeds then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be given away he also had to painstakingly construct fake log books for each day of a journey he did not take eventually the loneliness the guilt and the realization that he would likely be caught weighed too heavy on his final log entries make the musings of a kurtz seem entirely sane only a few weeks from home he turned his boat away from home and is reported to have jumped overboard soon thereafter br br odyssey is a fascinating one and its ending is heartbreaking but strikes of inevitability our dreams so often turn into fears and the consequences of our actions often leave us so few options for a happy ending it is a story of a descent into madness teased on by the infinite abyss of the cruel seas the filmmakers do a wonderful job in telling this story it's put together with chilling audio and video recordings done by and narrations of his ever increasingly maddening log notes the story starts slowly and may distract some viewers but the rewards of the story are entirely worthwhile as it progresses br br there are also inquiries into some of the other competitors such as frenchman bernard who was on par to likely win the speed competition only to pull out and begin a second trip around the world also in the film is robin knox johnston who was the winner of the competition he donated his prize money to the family br br to read briefly on the saga simply does not do justice it's interesting of course but a quick browse bypasses the raw emotions and oddness presented here the final moments of deep water are genuinely heart breaking hearing the thoughts of his widowed family and the adoration and understanding of his friends this is a fascinating story and it is that which carries the documentary into such great channels
<START> spoiler spoiler this movie stunk just let me say now that i totally agree with what had to say about this what was sam thinking she was with a guy who told her he loved her 3 times in total was extremely hot and stuck with her though her trying times josh hartnett but she decided to break up with him no cheat on him with a snobby ugly spoiled rich brat jerk loser who never said he loved her in the entire movie oh wait he wrote it on the wall does that count and left her in her time of need because he was scared chris loser klein who would you want to be with the only reason i sat through the entire movie was because it had josh hartnett in it and hoping that maybe she would die at the end i wanted jasper to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of him the whole your mom thing was funny i enjoyed it i hate it when people around here say it but i think that kelley deserved it jasper should have said it to sam as well she needed a good slap how the romance started is a mystery to me they never said anything to each other anyway so i don't understand how they got together i was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me did it have mustard or or oh what a come on the supposedly romantic lines were so stupid plus he's ugly i must admit i did cry in this movie for a long time really hard not because she died but because she broke heart he cried in this movie so many times he tried to smile for her but he couldn't stop the tears he cried when 1 he told her he loved her 2 she got sick 3 chris klein came back and he saw how happy she was w him 4 she died i cried when he cried because he loved her her entire life and told her and yet she was dumb enough to not care and love a guy who left her in her time of need and who did not cry at the funeral 1 1 2 stars only because i love josh hartnett oh by the way chris klein your mom sis
<START> well first off the twins are exactly the same there is no one is girly and one is tomboy ashley is taller than mary kate though and their boyfriends aren't even french so that is bad because they are faking the accents lamo it is also not that bad not their best i am a big mary kate and ashley fan don't get me wrong the storyline is ok and it is funny to watch it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again but hey when they made this movie they were still new at the whole making their own movie thing the girls also act like they are older then 13 but if you are a young viewer this is a good movie not so good if you are older than 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids then it's ok good luck mk a with your future movies
<START> on the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics particularly concerned with himmler the ss and their research branch it also has some good piano music some interesting footage and some excellent camera work br br however it is a very poor piece of historical work it has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows br br himmler set up a department in the ss for research into the origins of the german race they went all over the world they did some things and launched to all manner of places of these avenues were explored the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted they wanted to establish that the aryan race and the german people were one and the same thing through historical proof they didn't find any the members of this research group were leading professors members of the ss and therefore linked to the holocaust and were seen as ok after the war and went on to lead german institutes br br these facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people or them nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme the aim of the program is unclear it hops from topic to topic the witnesses though presented as credible are few and unsupported br br sadly this programme does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress the topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on i would avoid this br br also the 'holy the german bloodline nothing to do with the holy grail of christian mythology except in passing mentions of to look for the christian holy grail are made but never followed through the title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete
<START> one commenter said if you like austin powers you will like this movie i liked powers and was disappointed with this movie the film works hard maybe too hard for laughs maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny i get where they were trying to go with this flick a cross between zorro and the scarlet pimpernel but it just doesn't work austin powers if silly but intelligent zorro the gay blade lacks the savvy of austin powers the big lebowski or kingpin br br i kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script my 15 year daughter also thought the movie was flat my 17 year old who selected this flick on it's title walked out after 20 minutes br br it seems many people on imdb liked this film but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy
<START> for any wrestling fan this is the wrestlemania to forget no logic to the matches some garbage gimmicks doink the clown and the giant gonzalez this was a forgettable ppv something rare for the wwe f the logic of hogan winning the world title at the end made no sense and many people feel that alone help put the nail in the ppv from the meaningless gimmicks of the roman soldiers to simply some real bad wrestling doink vs crush being the worst match to simply bad match making scott razor ramon vs bob how can you have one of the greatest mat wrestlers making a comeback and working his first wrestlemania face a power wrestler who was undefeated at the time this is a ppv that even the wwe has since admitted was way below what the expected just all around a stinker
<START> 'the is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them written by ronald harwood himself a former dresser to the legendary donald it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the br br as 'sir' the overbearing actor and main focus of the play albert finney is a joy to watch whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the winds ' bit of 'king or chatting to his faithful stage manager madge eileen atkins good as ever about the old times as norman his camp dresser tom gives a fabulous performance wiggling around at the beck and call of collecting a bottle to go at the pub or disparaging the former fool mr davenport scott often mentioned but never seen br br in an engaging support cast there's edward fox as a typical arrogant second lead zena walker as her ladyship lockwood west as the replacement fool and many others br br this film has great energy bringing with it some of the of its stage origins it is true but being so well acted you don't notice very well done indeed
