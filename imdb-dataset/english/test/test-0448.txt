<START> each show is excellent finally a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talking about why they are like normal people shame it got canceled br br mike scully and julie formerly of the simpsons wrote or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of the similar style humour seeps in here take officer steve cox and think troy mcclure however it does come with its own unique brand of humour and let's face it a teenage girl will love it just by on the faces alone br br what is it with television that cancel most good shows and we are spoon fed with such abominations as who my mother almost slept with or whatever that show is called please learn a lesson not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic travails or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward well my griping is done for the day now back to the simpsons when is it on oh yes all the time
<START> i honestly don't know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as ernest goes to africa aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film there is nothing positive about this hour and a half waste of time and life it is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act film and edit this piece of trash and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the ernest series br br during the opening credits of the movie we see ernest posing next to various african objects such as wooden masks and the heads of african animals making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh this opening scene gives the viewer a taste of ernest's frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95 of the time br br the first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is everyone in the film is a typical c movie actor but linda stands out as especially terrible she is the epitome of overacting all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you'd find only in a middle school play most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance jim varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices br br ernest goes to africa begins in africa where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an african tribe the gems then make their way back to the united states where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market he hides them in a bucket of two for a dollar items and then runs from the scene ernest is looking for a gift to buy for rene a waitress he likes so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems he later takes them back to his house paints them and glues them together to make a yo yo he gives the yo yo to rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average and she wants a man of adventure rene and ernest are tracked down by the henchmen and are then brought to africa to be kept as prisoners br br most of the movie really doesn't make sense once ernest is in africa he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river in the next scene we see him as a hindu servant named hey you his skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth at first i thought jim varney was playing another role in the film in addition to ernest but i immediately recognized ernest's idiocy once hey you began to speak br br another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the african wilderness rene and ernest have taken an ostrich farmer's truck and are being chased by the henchmen driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road both henchmen are shooting at ernest who is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck ernest on the other hand is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver the henchmen never hit ernest once during the five minute chase but ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke i should also add that ernest is the eggs two at a time from a large bra br br the set design is also incredibly poor in this movie there is a large portion of the film in which rene and ernest are walking in africa trying to find civilization during their hike we see them walking through fields and jungles which probably could have been shot anywhere in the united states the fields are simply plain fields with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near africa they could have at least digitally added some african trees in the background and the jungles look like the woods of rural connecticut with papier skulls vines and thorns hanging from trees according to imdb com the film was actually shot in south africa but i still wouldn't believe that at all br br the movie goes on and on ernest joke after ernest joke the rest of the movie doesn't really make any sense either the african tribesmen all speak english for some reason and ernest is later challenged to a battle of truth by the lead henchman who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive the henchman has a table of axes swords knives and before him while ernest has a table with a sandwich a teddy bear and a few other worthless items however ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day br br overall this movie is painful to watch i couldn't handle it in one sitting i had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate humor they should really put a surgeon's general warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie i would have to say that out of all the movies i have ever seen none comes close to being as pitiable as ernest goes to africa
<START> if you would have asked me 1 month ago how this movie was i probably would have left most of this out but i am a fan and as any fan i visit the movies sites often well when super troopers came out i visited that site after the release on dvd and was hooked yea it's a difficult site to stay on but the good ones normally are like good families they stick together what a story this company comedy troop has begging people to come and see there movies on street corners universities anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years they crap on it and decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans but the worst thing about it they didn't tell any of them they just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are you know the same fans they begged years ago still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with super troopers and got everyones attention and thank god for that because after that they have sucked with everything else good for you guys way to go mainstream just remember when you realize your material isn't that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who crapped the original ones away fans make you who you are not the other way around never burn your bridges
<START> ok lets start with the best the building although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting other than that its not worth it br br as far as the bad its done by wwe films wtf is that supposed to make you want to see it if anything stay away horrible horrible idea for them to make movies and allow gregory dark to direct it bad choice the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertaining br br i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is untalented actors a disappointing vague storyline apparently many of the actors are from that show all saints its a wonder why i haven't ever heard of them or their show other than that the bus driver which you never even see just him closing the door has had more action that just about everyone together at least he handles stunts for some decent films br br i like to see scary movies i really do but this one blew so much the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through very annoying the child behind me was more during the previews of other horror films br br this is not a film to see even less if you have to pay for it
<START> when the china syndrome was released plenty of right wing critics and pro nuke supporters blasted this film particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power but it only took two weeks and a near catastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics up br br fonda and douglas are the l a news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the nuclear power plant douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass but the tv station will not air the footage fearing a massive lawsuit it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident br br but a conscientious shift supervisor jack lemmon has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that though it would be extremely costly and lengthy if repairs aren't made the next accident could be apocalyptic but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political technological and human interest stories together in one disturbing package br br while obviously quite politically liberal in nature the china syndrome well directed and co written by james bridges the paper chase is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together fundamentally nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect that is what the film is saying and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way it says it brilliantly
<START> following on from the huge success of nick park and the aardman team with the wallace and gromit short animations we now have the first hopefully of many feature with the plasticine characters that so many love the dvd of the movie has proved to be the most durable and best used of my two children's many christmas presents by a long way the plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the w g films for me is the background gags there are plenty of up front gags and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy but the background is the killer for me all in a classy addition to an already classy filmography for nick park and i would recommend fans and new watchers to see this film often
<START> seriously people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny and this movie is f king hilarious better than the first and knoxville really grew a pair for this film and did way more crazier stunts then the first if ebert and roper not saying that i'm a huge fan of theirs can look past the pure idiocy of this film enough to give it 2 thumbs up then i think other people can to i wasn't sure what to expect from this but i was floored and it is rare when a sequel is better than the original this new one i believe exceeds the first big time so do what i did just relax kick back try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass off
<START> caught this flick as one of a five for 5 deal from a local video store and it was a most pleasant surprise it's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up they tell each other these stories to kill time and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o henry esque ending that left me gleeful a real discovery blood and plenty of it breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicely barrett is worth the price of admission alone this one is a keeper jim bob says check it out br br oddly enough pumpkinhead was one of our five choices too and imdb recommends that for anyone who likes campfire tales i'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one samhain
<START> i would say this is a background movie play it the background as your tending to busy work laundry checking email etc i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted wrong it was done in 2009 the screenplay script is pretty awful i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along it almost seems like it's a made for tv movie based on the cinematography am i watching a tv show br br even the secretary breaks out into song what the f is going on actually she seemed to have the best voice amy adams was so great in enchanted lead actor is average disappointed for sure this movie would have been good for lifetime but that's about it
<START> there have been several books that have cited this as the earliest gay cinema i don't really see this as all that gay in the homosexual sense but then seeing two men dancing in what has to be the worlds first movie musical does have its attraction br br there have been several earlier comments about this film dismissing any homosexual overtones as to those that are quick to dismiss this film as just being silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks well i've heard that story before br br this film is of interest as an oddity and if folks want to consider it the first gay film so be it better this than the depressing 1919 anders als die
<START> watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film he's a teenager watchers has it's good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts i'm a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trained br br the film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the are not far behind br br watchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a 80's horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out
<START> i've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn't give me the best impression of the film then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me i was watching through my fingers the whole way through so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has chad michael murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh
<START> well as a life long fan of kung fu films i have to say this is one of the best i have ever seen sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it entertain as does most movies of the genre this film is packed with action and does not boar its viewers it's so damn fun when i watch i have a smile on my face the whole time this also has an impact on future films like kill bill many of kill bill's sound effects come from this film for example this is essential viewing for all knew viewers in kung fu form open to close this film is filled with fights that really are some of the better i have seen in the genre there are few kung fu films out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film so if in search of a great kung fu movie check this one out for sure
<START> i think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress drew barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something i never imagined her being a great flick with lots of laughs i don't usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one
<START> i remember watching this movie over and over again when i was a kid i loved it whilst i haven't watched it recently i am sure i would enjoy it just the same today its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh the situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative i particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion the robbers and the nuns this nice humour style is much missed these days also this movie proved that actor paul keenan dynasty days of our lives was off to a great start i recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop
