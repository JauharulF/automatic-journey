<START> if the directors producers publicists wish to promote a film as based on actual events and make a film that is meant to inspire and have meaning then for a start to maintain any sort of creditability and integrity you would want to keep a film as honest as you possibly can br br a team wearing all black jumpers and doing the in america is just plain dumb any half intelligent person would know that the all blacks are the national rugby union team of new zealand and their jumpers are all black and the is performed by them as a part of a traditional dance br br having such stupidity in a movie without explanation merely reduces the credibility of the movie to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve br br the question is why why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain br br i can only conclude that the writers or director or producers have seen it on tv before a international rugby union match and thought wow that would be great in our movie no one will know that it never happened they're all too dumb to know about nz nd the all blacks this will be great br br how would an americian audience react to a movie made in nz about americain grid iron with a team wearing an american indian costumes and war paint doing a native american indian war dance running round in circles shouting oh woo woo woo oh woo woo woo react they'd laugh their heads off br br the people that made this movie and the industry that spawned it really should have their heads read for some reason the industry thinks that they can fool all the people all the time br br it's just dumb
<START> nicole finn madonna is just being released from prison although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record griffin dunne is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law will be driving around the city anyway in his future mother in law's rolls royce picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector nicki however starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving between big cats taxi drivers hit men and a wedding cake with guns lawyer knows he's not in kansas anymore is there a way out of the madness this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue madonna and perfect foils to each other making their connection uproarious as they play out their roles as an ex con and an uptight button down lawyer respectively the script is laudable in it's ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one and the next everything secondary from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes are also quite nice if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy rent this movie for them you will both be pronto
<START> it may not be oscar material however this was a very funny film i was always a fan of eddie richie bottom young ones were legendary tv series' and it was about time they made a film some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant from the pencil is the rear end to the rubber sex pants as well was the infamous line that richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye he says to eddie candle in the eye candle in the eye and eddie been the simpleton that he is sticks the candle he's carrying into his eye can't forget when eddie is on his motorbike and he needs to urinate it was a great comedy not to be taken seriously at all but the film lacked with an ending br br overall a comedy full of laughs and lots of fake green vomit a 9 10 br br
<START> a few bratty kids unwittingly unleash an evil that has lain dormant for the past twenty years and have to reap the ill fortune that comes with that the campbell brothers' film before this midnight skater was fun their picture after the red skulls was all right so why is demon summer so mind numbingly bad i really don't know it is better then their splatter rampage wrestling but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringe worthy and when a 'horror' film is as talky as this one is that's not a good thing the story's been done to death in many other better films so why waste your time on this one br br my grade d
<START> this is a family comedy in the very best senses of the term about faith and family ann blyth with the help of everybody's favorite grandpa edmund gwenn gets divine help in lifting the above the would be vengeance schemes of mccarthy john mcintire pure fun
<START> ali g has got to be one of the funniest films i've seen in a long time and cohen's portrayal of a british gangsta is hilarious this film has cult classic written all over it and it features some really great lines ali g is a good time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end definitely vote ali g and keep it real
<START> the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances this typical rising star musical has an overworked plot even for 1944 but because of the actors it's still fun to watch hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer but she has a lot of charm that fits her character kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while silvers provides plenty of self deprecation and laughs the movie can also be very serious at times not a must see but recommended if you like the actors
<START> another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying pulp fiction br br if you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half this'll probably fit the bill fans of the debut episode of aeon flux wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers single handedly will really go for it br br otherwise it's not exactly a clever movie in fact all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people sometimes an entire scene goes by and the only thing that happens is you guessed it someone gets shot or to spice things up twenty people get shot first they're just sitting there the next minute they're sitting there dead yahoo br br rough plot a young american goes to paris an american in paris get it hires a prostitute the ethereal julie delpy gets in touch with some old french buddies one of which has aids they plan and attempt a bank heist of course movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off w o a hitch and this hitch takes up about three quarters of the running time it's like dog day afternoon without the sidney lumet's wit patience or humanity while at the bank things go wrong surprise and the parisian with aids goes wacko with his uzi several hundred times no spoilers here but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film br br some have called it stylish perhaps it is but it's someone else's style it's a movie that's already been done and killing zoe is trapped by convention nowhere in the course of the movie does the director roger co winner of the pulp fiction screenplay oscar do anything really original stylish funky or outrageous unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the multitude
<START> warning spoiler spoiler spoiler br br this is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from mood for love perplexed and confused about paths the main characters choose in life from reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie br br we are so use to seeing blatant sex in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the dirty deed by simply showing the slack mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip meet your child br br the director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of mr chow and mrs chan last warning spoiler spoiler spoiler br br mr chow fools mrs chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever next scene mrs chan leans her head on mr chow in the taxi and says i do not want to go home tonight translation let's do it br br why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses get a divorce raise their love child and live happily ever after the answer is that this whole story takes place in hong kong during the sixties a bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress whereas a legitimate child could live a tragic but noble honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating father the invisible mr chan in short mr chow and mrs chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child br br that is why mr chow upon learning that mrs chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making mrs chan his mrs chow he then also realizes why mrs chan went to all the way to singapore to be with him only to reconsiders at the last and leave choosing to never see him again but not before taking some unnamed mr chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell no one except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer but only if we listen
<START> i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of but that didn't really show there wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious deserted and uncharted planet none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive there weren't any great explanations of what was going on which can be really contrived so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed i found that i quite warmed to most of the characters there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant i think mr and his crew should be quite proud of themselves i've seen worse films with a budget of millions
<START> although this movie is inaccurate overall there are some items that may be true certainly he was a wild character in his youth having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at west point almost expelled several times graduating last in his class of 34 and often reckless in his leadership during the civil war br br but history may have made him a scape goat of the indian wars certainly he did his share of cruel things but how much was he under orders also there is evidence that he testified before congress at great risk to his commission and command that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation br br as a character said in the play when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war the character states history will do what it always does it will lie who knows how bad a man custer was certainly he wasn't the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed
<START> i would probably say this was on a par with films like devil's rain and that sort of film although this is probably a bit better made i love 70's horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria seems like the children have been disappearing after an initial attempt to flee this place the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town they're all satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service i guess not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise this is fairly classy considering that it's scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today which seem to have replaced actual scares we have hank kimball moore from green acres as tobey a sheriff's deputy that reads ufo magazines and jones as the sheriff and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family and martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes but overall works pretty well is recommended for fans of 70's horror 8 out of 10
<START> foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous disfigured gypsy br br the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination the victim characters are all too familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them we just wonder when they will die not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless unnecessary nature footage however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere and a decent music score by don still it's business as usual for dead camper movies br br there are much better films in this vein but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die hard slasher fans although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn 1981 wrong turn 2003 or even the final terror 1983 again br br 1 2 out of
<START> spoilers br br br br br br br br br br this is br br this is not br br practically everyone is written horribly out of character when it comes to characterization the only bright spot is the friendship between and ryoko br br also the villainess is not punished for her actions which amount to mind control rape if a male villain had done to one of the women what does to then he would have rightfully so painfully bought it at the end of the movie dying horribly and the audience would have cheered but not only does pay no price for her crimes ryoko actually forgives and understands her actions no the real ryoko would have disintegrated her for what had done to her beloved the audience i saw this with myself included all booed audibly at this scene br br anime fans avoid this movie fans avoid this movie even harder
<START> this performance leaves you with no wishes we saw it in germany and it is breathtaking we only got the cheap tickets at the far back but still had a view over everything that happened if you ever get the chance to see this live then go it is worth the trip and if i were you i would wait a good half an hour after the show to 'cool down' the performances are breathtaking and all around the tent there are dressed performers that are there to distract help smile and generally make the whole tent come alive the music live music is as good as the cd version perfect i bought a dvd later but the show that was filmed had less colourful costumes it's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet a great trip for old and young and a great film too
