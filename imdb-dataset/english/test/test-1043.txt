<START> there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short br br the grinch i thought was marvellous jim carrey is a truly talented physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor in my opinion mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying i used to like him very much in his waynes world and so i married an axe murderer days but ive never been fond of austin powers and the cat in the hat has just finished me off br br this film was horrible the gags were horrible inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years the plot was messy messy messy its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was mom they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly revolting over acted portrayal of the cat br br i mean did myers even glance at a script was one written the other actors seemed to have one but the cat just seemed to be winging it br br on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous but unfortunately they cant save this film br br poor dr seuss the man was a genius dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy messy way br br 1 10
<START> this is the 4th movie in the karate kid series however it has nothing to do with the previous 3 the only character remaining is mr this time around mr meets troubled teen julie pierce swank before she was famous julie having all kinds of problem including being bullied at school by a guy belonging to a pseudo military club on campus naturally she is trained how to fight anyway through julie learns karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns how to respect herself and in the end regains her respect i like the unique idea of the antagonist being a female and having a male as her enemy i there are also some fight scenes which are done quite well very low key and minimal violence none of the fighting is graphic the ending is also good and a bit surprising it is predictable but not a typical ending for this kind of film the film has echoes of the original obviously especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned it is not as good as the 1st movie and certainly not as good as the 2nd it is however a giant leap forward compared to the underwhelming 3rd entry this is a very entertaining under dog movie that is suitable for the whole family 8 10
<START> i have just finished watching this movie and for me it takes ages to finish because it is so boring and the storyline is extremely bad br br now where should i start o the movie is called sinking of japan yeah yeah it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad compare to the movie the day after tomorrow i would have rate it at least 8 10 br br the sinking of japan does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes there isn't much excitement at all boring all i can say br br one more point i would recommend this movie to have a better title maybe something like the romance of sinking of japan because this movie does have lots of waste of time talk nonsense the love story is extremely boring have been dragging too long honestly i almost get frustrated br br overall this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e g many people running like hell to avoid death love story part was extremely not touching enough for me br br but hey there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though its has got good songs
<START> the music is by and not by stupid incompetent philip glass and was written ten years before glass' unfortunate birth the staging is simply extraordinary the narrative in japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the latin version does not have cf version the giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythic aspect of the tale the props and make up used for the plague are simply spot on it's best work the singers are very good especially is quite moving and clean and norman finds the right expression and her beauty is magnified here and finds its right place larger than life simply a must
<START> i saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when i couldn't get to sleep it didn't help in the slightest i found myself staring up at the ceiling trying to forget that face i could quite happily never see this cartoon again simply because of that face br br now don't get me wrong i love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone but this twisted and terrifying rendition simply is disturbing it is mainly the cruel laughter and the exaggerated features that terrify me and i still have nightmares because of it please i urge you not to allow your children to see this it is far far too scary please i pray you keep it away
<START> a very good episode although not as devastating a finale as the end of season 1 the idea to make it a desmond flashback worked very well and henry ian was fantastic perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot and after three minutes the previous episode i thought it would feature more but the strength of character and performance pulled it through the plot developments as always left more questions then answers like who are the others something we still don't know and where are they taking jack sawyer and kate what was the white light what impact has it had are locke eko and desmond dead as the hatch destructed around them if they are it would be a major mistake because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry o'quinn has been fantastic throughout both series as locke a fitting finale to a better series then the first
<START> i have never read a jacqueline susann novel but i have also seen valley of the dolls based on another of her books on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age certainly contrary to the books the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion design and behavior patterns and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot the set design fits the story perfectly and all the characters fit in too they're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture they are superficial and do not develop it is true but in this movie i wouldn't want it any different br br david hemmings reprises the role he played in antonioni's blow up and it's more than a rip off he's a fashion photographer looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed robert ryan reprises the role he played in max caught he is smith all over again greedy bored and boring uninspired and uninspiring it's possible ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance whatever happened it fits the picture dyan cannon is great fantastic wardrobe she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the hemmings character with a academy award statuette br br the title the love machine is of course meant ironically robin stone is a kind of a barry lyndon of the pop era incidentally the movie is slightly that he chooses a tv station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence he sees love meaning sexual favors merely as a means for personal advancement there are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie homosexuality is treated very casually probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period the open cynicism of the tv executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like a face in the crowd or network or truman show they are producing crap they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it br br i did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following provided it's given the chance meaning a dvd release
<START> jefferey dahmer was one sick guy there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said except that the many documentaries and films made about him are probably better than this one it's ridiculously cheesy it's so cheesy a guy who posted the whole film on youtube added some to make the viewer laugh br br carl crew who's he stars as serial killer jeffrey dahmer who's killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with and eat br br i didn't bother to watch the whole film through it's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught and since this film was made in 1993 one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate the death of dahmer isn't shown but it probably would've been as cheesy as this cheese fest br br 1 10
<START> intelligent summary isn't it br br if mad max was something of a simple straight forward nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film they totally made up for it with it's sequel the road warrior so in theory with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy now it's not br br such a huge disappointment beyond thunderdome was it's main premise is pretty cool with an 'underworld' think a mix between metropolis and the time machine but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction add the obnoxious tina turner and the no good story line of the people waiting for a plane and this is just one huge stinker br br maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget explosion kinda thing because this just isn't right br br 3 10
<START> some spoilers sweeping into new york city on a first class railroad car a killer who doesn't kill with a gun or knife or club but just with his or it's touch and breath a killer that's as old or even older then man himself that killer has a name it's know the world over as smallpox br br arriving in new york one cold november afternoon the killer hidden inside of sheila bennet evelyn keyes and like a horse it waits until the opportunity presents itself then like a ticking time bomb with it's fuse set off explodes throughout the length and breath of the city br br sheila knows that she's being followed by a u s customs officer who's been on her tail since she came back to the us from the island nation of cuba having smuggled 50 000 00 of illegal uncut diamonds she had to be careful in getting them to her husband matt charles to be cut and sold to unsuspecting in the city br br mailing the diamonds ahead of time sheila knows that if caught the diamonds won't be found on her what she doesn't know is that matt is two timing her by having an affair with her kid sister francie lola even worse he plans to check out of town with the diamonds leaving her as well as francie holding the bag br br even though we know right from the start of sheila's deathly condition it doesn't really come to the surface until much later in the movie the first half of the killer that stalked new york is a crime suspense drama with the u s customs officials and nyc police looking for the stolen diamonds as sheila starts to get sick and begins to infect everyone whom she comes in contact with the film reaches the point of a mass panic in the streets type horror movie br br both the police and custom officials together with members of the city's health race against the clock to find sheila before she infects the entire city of new york with the deadly smallpox infection that she's carrying sheila finding out from matt's boss willie dennis jim backus that he quit his job as a nightclub piano player and that he was having an affair with francie shocks her into the realization to what a heel he is br br confronting francie at her apartment it turns out that matt not only stiffed but her sister as well which later leads the guilt ridden francie to take her own life on the run and not knowing that she's infected with smallpox sheila goes to her brother sid with bissell who manages a flop house on the bowery to find a place to stay only too late does sheila and sid find out the the stolen diamonds is the last of her problems knowing that she's dying sheila goes to the office of arnold moss art smith knowing that sleaze ball of a husband matt who ended up beating old man moss into a bloody pulp is going to be there to exact vengeance on him br br type drama based on a true story with striking black and white on location photography makes this movie about the horrors of unseen and deadly smallpox unleashed on a unsuspecting public well worth watching
<START> it's complete nonsense i've studied nazism and read many manuscripts from the day the parallels use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of nazism and then compare it with complete generalizations about what constitute 1 3 of the planet it's crafted for an audience of polly anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon fed gibberish horribly thought out arguments irrational conclusions fallacious ideas and nonsensical logic br br who made this hit peace easy br br when all is said and done que bono that is who benefits in the long run br br you don't you sacrifice money and rights muslims don't they get our bombs try again answer this and you've unlocked a major door
<START> i'm surprised that the comparison hasn't been made yet between mind of mencia and the television program the awful truth which ran a few years ago helmed by controversial director michael moore the show would begin in the exact same manor as this show with moore interacting with the audience and introducing segments namely short documentaries and skits which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current issues the difference mencia rarely delves past the superficial and the reactionary what he says and does is often pandering and rude and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves there's a difference between being edgy which i have no problem with but mencia tries too hard to accomplish this and ends up coming off as arrogant and with little backing he does however make points occasionally but often in order to get to them one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor
<START> i gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars br br unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress in this film it's carly pope behaving like a ditz don't bother br br carly pope plays sara novak a young college student who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city a dangerous thing for even a well armed man to go in alone br br there are various intrigues in the film a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking sara a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole in the wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto a nerdish dim wit that hangs around the shop and a woman named emily gray who is back in prison br br sara's father is a lawyer who is handling emily gray's case br br a few years back emily gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged br br the only explanation emily has ever given for her crime is i never sinned br br it's all part of the design br br well my friend don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that because you won't
<START> the long kiss goodnight is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller and a career breakthrough for geena davis the plot is very familiar to that of the bourne identity but so what the fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours br br it's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches geena davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual good wife role samuel l jackson is good as usual as the supporting player the film's baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what's going to happen to him br br it breaks away from the usual run of the mill actioners such as commando and on deadly ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years good fun and good popcorn entertainment 7 4 10
<START> looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please just about any brain dead idiot this movie is beyond useless all the clichÃ©'s of a slasher film without any substance i am sure i could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up obviously everyone wants mandy lane and she apparently wants none of the guys throughout the movie you will see this br br when she stops being friends to the typical boy trapped in friend zone loser he goes ballistic and when she goes on a road trip to the middle of no where of course he begins to hunt them one by one sounds decent so far right but what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is her loser friend the killer but she is as well the plan was beyond ridiculous lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other they give no reason why they wanted to do this and given mandy lane's goody too shoes demeanor it makes you scratch your head even more as to what is actually motivating these characters to do anything they are doing it's sad this movie had lots of potential but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience in anyway
