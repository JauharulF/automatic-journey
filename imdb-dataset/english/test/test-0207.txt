<START> this movie was marketed extremely well when it was released in '97 during the middle of master fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves that's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250 000 copies and still goin' br br if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out it has a few old school videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party so what i got to say to all the people who don't like master p or no limit records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes
<START> ok so is a hunk but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted wasted oh the humanity br br poor sean astin had to follow his master up the very same hills of new zealand that wait it be someone in the production crew of lord of the rings was making home movies in his spare time yes that's it br br i wish i could at least say he was promising br br the special effects were often laughable br br but was a hunk br br
<START> i was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because i hated it i stuck it out to the end but it was painful especially having to listen to that voice of the child as 1 remarked even though the girl claimed to be from chicago she didn't have a chicago accent it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a ny accent but failed at that as well i was so confused that i was waiting for the punchline of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child why did they select this one and why force her to talk like that it wasn't even just the accent it was the script the monologue created for her the reason i even selected this movie was that the plot idea appealed to me this era in history the type of characters that are poor and uneducated the setting and the love triangle as far as i'm concerned it could have and should have been much better i was just soooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way that i did about this movie
<START> zeke mic is great you totally believe his character and it's scary as hell i spent half the movie covering my eyes the other half on the edge of my seat it's cool to see something this suspenseful and frightening that isn't all blood and guts but it did give me bad dreams br br basically this is a great movie see it the first chance you get
<START> this movie is very much like every other modern horror movie it's predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen that's really the biggest disappointment of the movie that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort br br you can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie clichÃ© it has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch one of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies same goes for the sort of drama aspects that involves the family it just doesn't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective it often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch br br so it has all of the clichÃ©s present but it also doesn't succeed at bringing any of these clichÃ©s well to the screen as an horror movie this simply is a very poor one it doesn't handle its horror or tension very well for the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy the movie its story isn't too well connected and build up within the movie too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn't ever allow its horror to fully kick in br br the movie is also often way too dark no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget and it shows very little gore as well mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well br br you can just tell by looking at this movie that director j s cardone doesn't has much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to handle its present ingredients properly he did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far he just keeps trying unfortunately who knows perhaps with the right people behind the camera's like tobe hooper who was initially attached to direct this movie still could had been something decent br br it's a poorly cast movie with mostly big unknowns in it biggest name of the movie is ben cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story it didn't even seemed like he had much fun playing br br just skip it br br 4 10
<START> this is the best of the films so far that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast previously they'd made the excellent waiting for guffman and following best in show they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind as for their latest for your consideration the less said the better br br the film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular you follow these few chosen dogs from pre show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious kennel club however none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world amazingly even though the characters are rather outlandish there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying as decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very cutthroat group of people my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and i also loved the openly gay couple as they were terribly funny and clever however the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from fred willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess the other contestants featured were also quite funny the high priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner the country boy and his hound as well as parents who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show br br despite the improvised style of film making the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story one that is not for dog owners only exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade clever and consistently funny br br by the way try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing while a bit painful to watch i loved seeing harlan pepper and his beach ball collection in particular
<START> spoilers abound you have been warned br br i was thoroughly disappointed this being my first street fighter movie i have seen i dare not go near the 1994 joke yet very little grabs your attention in street fighter zero alpha as opposed to most the fights are hilariously done over board shun versus was a laugher and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother br br the main street fighter ryu has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother a shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind br br what is with the artist 's drawing of feet any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive the story 's soft nature makes the street fighter genre far too intelligent and places far more emphasis on a character shun that is not even a fighter in the video game a character study on more than just the core stars of the original street fighter is completely ignored how many times did you catch guy street fighter zero lacks the imagination of the video game
<START> oh dear br br i love science fiction but this er 'movie' just puts space flicks to shame every sci fi film i've seen over the last year has been disappointing to some degree and i'm now seriously reconsidering what genre of movies i actually like in future maybe i'll watch romance flicks from now on br br spoilers alert and thats not saying much br br this flick is so insipidly dumb it rivals battlefield earth and baby geniuses in sheer badness the special effects are obviously fake the big mac truck looked stoopid with its roller coaster seat restraints the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the power rangers a huge fat guy is sucked out of a port hole window butt first and space truck school wtf br br mr hopper can do better than this what really stunk were the two good looking young things who accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants for an entire two thirds of the flick the obligatory 'sex scene' snicker between our young heroes was so poorly performed i nearly choked on my tonsils laughing at the tv screen br br the only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain cyborg mad scientist he oozed the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy but i believe he could've been much more menacing he does and says things which are quite funny all the best scenes involve him so for the captain i give this movie an extra point br br but this flick is so bad it'll make you want to hurl abuse at the tv or maybe throw your tv out the window it may even kill off a few brain cells and put you into a catatonic state br br conclusion i like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his peg leg when its obviously a fake peg leg i would've given it 0 out of 10 but since he cracks me up with his stoopid antics this flick gets 1 10
<START> the animatrix a detective story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it carrie anne moss plays trinity in this animated cartoon i really like the 'private detective' ideas created by the director
<START> after seeing this film i did not want my money back i wanted my time back i wanted that hour and a half back in my life it was the most amazing hideous torture to know that i had squandered precious minutes of my life on this dreck i am scarred for life and ever since this film entered my life i have had trouble sleeping i am trying to suppress the memories really i am but they make me want to burn things br br
<START> chaplin was great a silent comedian but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies in my opinion chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous his career never recovered when sound came to film contrary to most of the reviews i have read chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian and not spend their entertainment dollar watching chaplin's political commentary br br despite chaplin's awards and knighthood i would take exception to his contributions to humanity the great dictator was made at the same time brutal dictatorship was having it's show trials and both dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of poland by both dictators wwii started in an attempt to save poland the nazi's were defeated in 6 years but poland disappeared as a sovereign country this happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of hollywood by the federal government had chaplin included joe stalin in this satire in addition to including the italian dictator perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians the mistreatment of jews and exceeded the nazi's in time and numbers br br judged simply as a film many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers who wouldn't know who goebbels goring or mussolini were a classic piece of art must stand the test of time classic greek tragedy the mona lisa and beethoven's 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not the generation in which they are made but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me br br chaplin as the writer director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome film br br chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous if chaplin found the us so offensive why didn't he return to his native land great britian fought the blood and money what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european dictators switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class and cares little about people who can't join the club
<START> this is a great little movie full of interesting characters and situations while not in the same class as some of the better known movies of its time it is still extremely watchable and memorable the scene where zachary scott sitting on a bus casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him is terrific it defines his character beautifully a guy who's so low he'll purloin something of value to a war veteran to use as a prop in his various he lies easily as the situation calls for and captivates the women in the household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile br br i couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of mildred pierce scott and bruce bennett were teamed again and faye emerson bears some resemblance to joan crawford with her facial bone structure and large eyes also the mona freeman character is not unlike the odious veda in mildred pierce br br i agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat with the convenient tumble over a cliff for ronnie mason zachary scott's character also in one of the final scenes we see bratty mona freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older smoother zachary scott i think the script should've called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode but these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well made movie

<START> when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing especially when they were getting chased by the water and when the guy drove through peoples gardens i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line the special effects this movie clearly didn't have a big budget either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had up what were the actors thinking did they actually believe that it was a good movie or did they just really need the money not that they would've earned a lot when i first saw this i was like how old is this ' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003 i thought my tv was broken br br this really is a disaster movie in more ways than one
<START> this film promised a lot so many beautiful and well playing actors but with a plot that had virtually nothing to say so many potentially promising conflicts between the family members that could have been developed and elaborated but it was all dropped and not taken care of there was no story to be told just a show off of acting technique beautiful scenes that were all empty but again the acting was excellent so many of the individual scenes were entertaining but as you became increasingly aware of the lack of underpinning ideas even the acting lost its sense so from the promising start you became increasingly disappointed as the non story went along
