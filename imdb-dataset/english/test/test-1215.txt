<START> while watching this film recently i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957 and in the ussr that makes it all the more remarkable many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 but they were quite original in 1957 i first saw this film in 1963 when it was first released in the us and i was struck by its originality then now just having seen it 40 years later i have no reason to change my mind
<START> well to do american divorcÃ©e with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in tuscany much more money whilst having to dicker over the price she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous for her workmen and wander around italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support interminable boredom and the inevitable italian lover ensue this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ingÃ©nue throughout which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks along the way smashing into a variety of mostly italian cardboard stereotypes dykes divas senile and gigolos among them bloated with unnecessary scenes the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'la dolce vita' a similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'only you' norman vastly superior ode to italy and romance sun' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade despite its admittedly well lensed panoramas of italy bonus negative point for the extraneous lover in at the last minute to provide requisite hollywood ending for its targeted audience of oprah brainwashed housewives avoid at all costs unless of course you view oprah and dr phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse
<START> east side story is a documentary of musical comedy in stalinist russia and later in the eastern european satellite comedies with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors although some of the stalinist films look laughingly bad the bright road being a notable exception the films from the sixties actually look pretty good my wife wants to sing the white mouse and midnight revue look particularly entertaining the producers had to contend with the censors who had the power to decide what was politically correct which led to some confusion humorous in retrospect since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the iron curtain there were only something like forty made in forty years they had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences who made major hits of some of the films br br i notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better the directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment and stringent power regulations they had to film in seven minute takes or less and dangerous br br i also notice that west side story seems to have had a strong influence on hot summer the later films may not measure up to singin' in the rain but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of bye bye birdy
<START> every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense anticipation and allure to the plot this story falls completely flat in this area there is no conflict at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters and so suspense is flat there is no anticipation and there really is no allure at all br br the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best and with the talent of these two particular actors i was quite surprised during the movie i expected them more to play a game of and chat about the weather than see any moving passion br br while i'm a fan of both actors i do believe that the casting in this movie was off or perhaps the direction was off base and it impacted their deliveries the writing was very weak which also might have impacted the performances most certainly the script could have used some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance br br this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon but only after it's on the cheap shelf br br sorry diane ladd and richard gere
<START> hr is what himesh is called in the movie i think he likes it too it's amazing how intelligent people talented even fall in to the same trap br br i really like it's amazing what he has done no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself br br and i truly expected a great film what with the budget of 50 cr and the cute actress as intense as is i thought he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role ironically he is depicted the same but for what care sheer incompetence carelessness awful acting banal background music insensitive direction make it a real pain br br blunders rule ex how can german police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in english they communicate among themselves in english unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too the worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care br br songs are the only saving grace br br please don't repeat this hr and find yourself a good director low budget no problem br br the villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know after all it's a movie
<START> i first saw this short when i bought a random dvd of short films a while ago this is the only short on the dvd i liked but i don't just like it i love it if you spend any amount of time with me you will see it it is beautiful simple and passionate no bells no whistles it could have been done with a but don't get me wrong the animation is elegant and insightful this person clearly spent plenty of time with cats but it is simply black and white and then there is writing and the music it is simply beautiful br br i eat chocolate drink wine and watch it over and over again br br nothing else matters i wait for pedro to come up with something else
<START> this is one of michael jackson's best music video's ever made vincent prices rap is totally cool and the zombies dancing with michael is totally amazing michael jackson is one of my favourite singers and he is one of the best singer's in the world way to go michael
<START> having just seen walt disney's the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short it does get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony
<START> in 1937 darryl zanuck who had recently moved from head of production at warner brothers was trying to get his newly created company 20th century fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at warners and the glitter palace at mgm this is my affair was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century san francisco in old chicago and in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily the plot is fascinating a trouble maker but heroic naval officer robert taylor is given a secret assignment by president mckinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing american finance he finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot barbara stanwyck and must decide between love and duty br br not everything about this vintage film works well but overall it is a good slice of studio film making the plot gimmick would be borrowed by kurt vonnegut for mother night the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by nick nolte and seems quite believable at least within the confides of studio make believe as a fan of old movies i am always thrilled when i stumble upon one that i have never seen and this is my affair was no exception
<START> the movie is precious and cage is a babe br br but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is atrocious br br where's the clash the ramones misfits social distortion the cramps sex pistols anyone the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing at least they play the cure br br plus randy's feathered hair and khakis br br this definitely looks like a movie about punks the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punks br br although it's a 90's movie slc punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980's just sayin'
<START> my friend i rented this movie and within the first 5 mins we had no idea what was going on it felt like it should have been over within the first 15 mins it was a terrible movie my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the ones in the movie and the plot if you can call it that was full of holes never would i recommend this movie to my worst enemy yet anybody i actually like
<START> is for sure a great movie i have to give it to mani for a great directing job and a r rahman for great songs the camera work is just excellent and is similar to black hawk down and saving private ryan i will be shocked if this movie does not win an oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work
<START> why did they unleash this movie upon us it seems as though they set out to make this movie a total slap in to anne rice and every self respecting vampire chronicles fan it ignores the ground work laid down by interview with the vampire mutilates the plot of the novel and has stuart townsend stumbling around drunk br br stuart is not our lestat our brat prince our adventurous rebel with the sense of humor stuart is a second rate boring rip off of dracula in black leather he did not read the books or know the character is he illiterate tom cruise is dyslexic and still he made a point to read the books and know and love lestat br br don't kid yourselves it is not a stand alone vampire flick it's trash plain and simple
<START> someone reviewed this movie as a waste of time because he she was expecting the beautiful scenery of brazil and portugal but then everything looked washed out or gloomy or something to that effect i believe this person missed the entire part of the film this is reality the point of this movie is to show that life is not indeed ideal and to show what people go through in their lives for family love and survival a young man leaves his slum in sao paolo brazil to go to portugal to visit his mother's home country after her death he discovers that not everything is free and that brazilians are looked down upon by native people from portugal he eventually finds a life a love but the story does not end as expected and this is not a fairy tale story the part that got me most was the ending song honey baby by gal costa it fit so well with the movie especially the ending
<START> this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some because most of the horror is mental but it does have a little something for almost everyone including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie jillian is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance
