<START> this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel has become a dark cult classic of horror films
<START> is the wife of russian filmmaker elem who directed the more commercially known 1984 film come and see generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever bar none notable for its searing poetic intensity but i believe it lacks the inner complexity of this even greater russian film which examines not just the graphic outer horrors but she finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings the ending of which is simply awe inspiring bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a gun skirmish over the opening credits where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration focusing on grim faces worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat a terrified population under occupation starving children with petrified mothers all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow like cranes are flying 1957 this features a russian army in retreat a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out the russian countryside has been overrun by german nazi's who are terrorizing the citizens stealing what food they have forcing them under duress to become their informant eyes and ears what russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests but are forced to send food to neighboring farms this film follows two soldiers that from the outset are on a near impossible mission as there's little food left anywhere in the dead of winter one is healthy and fit vladimir as while the other boris as is slowed down by a tubercular sounding cough and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead but his partner heroically rescues him as they step through knee deep snow drifts crawling at some points with insufficient protection against the harsh elements like so many other russian films nature itself becomes their toughest foe br br spoilers everything is reduced to a matter of survival when they reach their destination the farm has been demolished and left in a state of rubble pushing forward into german occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly soviet collaborator who fears nazi retribution the partisan soldiers think him a coward but move on where they are eventually captured and brought to a nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners along with a proud and protective mother lyudmila who helped hide them tarkovsky stalwart appears as the interrogator a russian teacher from a nearby academy turned nazi sympathizer russians torturing and executing fellow russians is the depth of war depravity and is brilliant in the despicable role he's perfectly suited for from what we can see as nazi officers chat in close proximity to one another he is an outsider even among this group seen instead as a kind of gruesome black cloaked undertaker who routinely sends men to their graves the audience is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on who offers nothing but contempt while speaks freely hoping to save his life but both are condemned to die though is offered a chance to serve the german reich as a police agent the mother the elderly collaborator and a child are added to this group spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a soldier's mission of being a patriot a mother a coward or a collaborator each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive but offers himself as a selfless example attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption br br by the next morning seems mildly amused mocking them at their sudden willingness to talk but spares no one except who changes sides to keep his life in his thoughts that if he's alive at least he has a chance to escape but there is no from this torment what happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace as we witness the treachery of war without a single shot being fired as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness the pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless as there is never a moment without impending menace gorgeously shot by vladimir who died in the same car accident as featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement much of it at close range using especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken accentuated by the psychologically horrific music of alfred which resembles the transcendent yet furiously disturbing monolith music from kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment dogs barking wind blowing bullets firing nearby nazi's chattering in untranslated german or laughing sadistically at their helplessness which only ratchets up the hideous tension to insane heights in many ways resembling dreyer's the passion of joan of arc 1928 utter insanity is exposed here the relentless realization that you have no choice yet you are forced to make one anyway the nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes where voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living like an explosion of neverending echoes yet only silence fills the crisp wintry air with a mournful reverence and a profound sense of loss
<START> sadly this film lives up to about 1 of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth for video game enthusiasts book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept whether on paper or gaming console that does not deliver and not only that goes well under the mark far cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film if you are a gamer that has played far cry do not watch this film anyone else who hasn't played the game it'll still seem like a b grade acted b grade directed movie uwe boll hang your head in shame this should've been easy to make into a blockbuster the storyline of the game was incredible think jurassic park meets alien and yet you still managed to take it and mould it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic video game companies be warned if uwe boll comes a lock the door oh til schweiger i look forward to seeing you make up for yourself in basterds what were you thinking taking this one on sigh
<START> the aristocats is classic disney at it's best it's not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more well known disney films but it's a well made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic aristocats is certainly a sure kids pleaser cause it has all the components for a fun kids film i'll liked it very much as a kid i'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake but i still enjoy this film as an young adult br br storywise aristocats may not be so complex or innovative but it doesn't matter this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa which aristocats certainly shows the characters make the film they're all likable fun have great lines and have a great interaction with each other the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling eva gabor as duchess phil harris as thomas and etc a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold br br aristocats is both entertaining and cute but it's also a very funny cartoon the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's french surroundings especially the city of paris looks greats the character animation and design is great and the songs are really catchy too my favorite is scale and but the title song is a cute song along with thomas cat and the memorable show stopper everybody want's to be a cat and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations br br overall aristocats is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered so what you're waiting for do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids it deserves to be in their memories
<START> it couldn't br br from the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout the immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around br br up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet the thing comes out on top and laughing who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today i for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits this wasn't just a senseless bloodbath come slasher horror flick this film had feeling emotion br br i truly can't recommend this film highly enough i have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching let alone bettering the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning feat of cinema
<START> first of all i am from munich where this movie takes place and believe it or not there are guys like and stefan including the silly dialect i know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just an assembling of their already known jokes but it is not the jokes are evolved through the story and make in their own special way sense but if you absolutely dislike und stefan hands of this movie everyone else it's worth viewing
<START> gregory peck and gig young are competing for the same girl and after peck sends young on a very dangerous mission they blame him for his reasons feeling guilty peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort where they are outnumbered by the indians peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers ward bond lon chaney jr neville brand among others are excellent the script is derived from a novel by charles marquis warren who was a specialist in westerns as a writer director and producer the idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including the dirty dozen made in 1967
<START> there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie although it is a tad predictable drew barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film excellent casting choice what i found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that and knowing how awful drew's character was ostrich feathers at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away regardless of what rumors her brother drums up and does food really make him all that popular i doubt it as for rooting for drew's character to win big as a reporter well i would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom a bit contrived having said all that it was a piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much
<START> as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different the director went to the new york film school from 1982 85 so one would think that he is drawing on this experience br br it is interesting how the film balances the message that one should not generalize with the notion that for every stereotype there is some underlying truth for example the italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well known italian stereotype the german character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes but the most stereotypical aspect about the movie is not a character but the central theme of infidelity as a critic observed infidelity is as crucial to french film as class is to british film br br both the main character and his girlfriend are played as not entirely likable which i think is deliberate and great br br it may be unintentional but some of the nationals have elements that could be taken as a metaphor for their countries' perceived role in the eu the british woman has a fling with an american who is an entertainer like a 1980's us president while the frenchman shows himself as the natural leader when the landlord shows up br br although europe is not as diverse as new york it is striking that we see only two non white characters one is a chilean woman with indigenous features who despite appearing the age of our main character is not portrayed as a potential object of interest another is a spanish or rather catalan male who appears a bit invented br br one might ask why chose protagonists who were all from long established eu member countries in western europe while these nationalities reflect what he and i would meet as students in the 1980's i believe exchange programs in contemporary europe are much more diverse the erasmus program encompasses some 30 countries from iceland to eastern europe many of which are not eu members i do understand however that the choice of nationalities that are more familiar to the majority of the viewership may have been deemed necessary not to distract from the contrast wants to create between the peoples' europe and the bureaucratic europe br br despite minor gripes a great movie that made me consider going back to europe to live a french friend of mine also an expatriate in the us captured our shared feelings in this piece of contradiction if europe was more like the us i would leave in a heartbeat
<START> italian rip off of mandingo and the drum is a badly dubbed italian life on the plantation yarn lots of people who don't look like they belong in the american south wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the american south the plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows the film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it its all tease its all probably racially insensitive i couldn't notice since its artistically bankrupt the final twist is at best laughable a major turkey
<START> one of the great tragedies of life is that disney is so very successful at everything that they do if they were not we might have more unique little gems of animation such as the curious adventures of mr the story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called up and down land i could have the name wrong he is hated by everyone his favorite hobby is shooting birds and at some point in the past he presumably killed the wife of mr a bird played with typical flair by peter ustinov leaving him with four young chicks to raise meanwhile we see that another of the evil king's hobbies is painting he has done three paintings in particular a self portrait a painting of a shepherdess which he has fallen in love with and a painting of chimney sweep of whom he is jealous one night the shepherdess and the chimney sweep climb down out of their paintings and run away together the self portrait of the king climbs down out of his frame as well and does away with the real king you think i'm making this up its the real plot and sends the royal police force after the young lovers mr then assists the lovers in attempting to escape the king's forces br br the plot is wonderfully surreal and the setting up and down land is an incredibly imagined place full of towering buildings accessible only by elevators its an equal mixture of the worlds of metropolis and 1984 and the drawings of dr seuss br br watch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most animated features
<START> i am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes i feel comfortable writing it now because unfortunately i know exactly how this film is going to end br br the premise is simple enough rabid dog on the loose in a small town kills people great simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror br br uhh no br br the main problem is this is based on a book stephen king and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film at least not with the same plot why cuz its boring the first 45 minutes tries to build depth to its main characters and create suspense it however lasts too long half the film the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway and it just about creates zero suspense the easiest film according to plot and time to compare this to it the classic jaws everything that jaws does right cujo does wrong jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread cujo does neither jaws effectively creates a scary creepy villain in its shark cujo has a dirty st bernard running about growling and jumping and not a lot else jaws is exciting and unpredictable cujo is a tireless bore that remains predictable right to the end br br also confusing is the plethora of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot br br if this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good but it wasn't it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life br br people on here are saying this is one of the best king adaptations im sorry you could not be more wrong the mist is a hundred times better thinner is 10 times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good this in my opinion is one of the worst the only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real even though they were dull br br films ended now and it didn't get any better avoid
<START> i'm so sorry but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before i thought that it will be a good film after 8mm what a sell there were nothing interesting in it except the beautiful hungarian women everything might be known forward it's a miracle i didn't sleep trough all i don't understand how might you let make it i'm so sorry but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before i thought that it will be a good film after 8mm what a sell there were nothing interesting in it except the beautiful hungarian women everything might be known forward it's a miracle i didn't sleep trough all i don't understand how might you let make it
<START> there's a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about transvestites tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject and trying very hard not to stereotype the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals and that aside from wearing women's clothing they lead a relatively normal life it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society the plot revolves around a police officer lyle talbot desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite so you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial in the context of 1953 subject br br having said all that i'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful in trying to portray glen glenda's edward d wood pain the movie falls into silly and at times surprisingly again given the era sensual fantasies that make the story very hard to follow the acting is wooden at best none of the dialogue comes across as real the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others and worst of all there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career pull the strings pull the strings poor lugosi's character called the spirit in the credits but really coming across as more of a mad scientist kept crying and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie br br for artistic merit the movie doesn't really deserve much more than 1 10 however for the courage involved in just putting it out i'll give it a 3 10
<START> if you go to the cinema to be entertained amused so as to fill up your time do not go out of your way to watch this film br br if you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human kind the feelings of real people to explore the characteriology of personalities if you go to the cinema to absorb magnificent photography be sure to put this film very high on your list preferably in first place the experience is profoundly rewarding causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse over the meaning of life itself with alejandro amenÃ¡bar has surpassed the best he has done to date and even redeemed certain deviations in his earlier films which smacked a little of being aimed at hollywood this is not the case with this visual poem put to music hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this inspired human and humane story br br in no way should one interpret as an apologia for euthanasia this story based on the real life of the fisherman ramÃ³n is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love a reaching out for human compassion for understanding emotions was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed a 2001 tv was the first version of this man's life on which i have already commented however amenÃ¡bar has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour in an equally articulate and intelligent way br br and javier bardem rose to the occasion met the challenge head on complete with a accent producing an electrifying compelling enthralling performance such that the actor and the fisherman become fused into being the same person on screen here indeed is an occasion to doff your cap and softly mutter bardem is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast especially belÃ©n lola mabel rivera los lunes al sol qv and clara and catalan accents taking prominent part br br amenÃ¡bar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one on one or in groups with excellent chemistry thus demonstrating that this young chilean born spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results his global concept of the film includes his own music interspersed with pieces by beethoven and on record player br br whilst viewing i found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with stephen and his masterpiece 'the qv i refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene br br javier photography is superb as usual as i have mentioned elsewhere on imdb he does not simply film the events and scenes he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment deftly catches that look in the eyes light and shadows such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story a superb artist br br is another landmark in the history of spanish cinematography among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years this film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'el qv 'los santos qv 'el qv 'la de las qv 'las qv 'a los que qv and i think i must add doy mis qv br br superbly orchestrated story of a real man and those who loved him around his bedside not to be missed
