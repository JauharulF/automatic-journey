<START> basterds is tarantino's worst film he has ever made it's full of his usual i e snappy dialogue brutal and sudden violence but it all deja vu the directing is typical tarantino and nothing seem's new at all it's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece pulp fiction br br there is nothing new or exciting about basterds to be honest it's just a war drama that isn't funny nor brilliant as pulp fiction was basterds supposedly is tarantino's tribute to leone's spaghetti western's but seem's mis jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub titles and the audience of balance
<START> damien o'donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into br br this is a fantastic film its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently tell everyone you know to go see it now fantastic br br the acting is excellent and dublin plays a starring role this film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema i can't wait til it comes out on dvd
<START> there are many familiar hitchcock elements of previous and later films and this time they mix to a jolly but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment you can tell that dorothy parker had a hand in the script the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people the famous climax on the statue of liberty seems a bit heavy handed judged by standards but also compared to other hitch monument finals e g blackmail north by northwest
<START> the most self indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to br br rent unwatchable much of the movie is obviously improvised br br and not well it looks like took the first take of br br everything the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when br br robert downey jr shows up then goes to hell again real br br quickly
<START> robert montgomery and robert young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in italy during world war i the dialog is highly entertaining and jimmy durante is hilarious as the ship's cook walter huston's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes i was surprised at how similar the technology of world war i was to the technology displayed 25 years later in world war ii basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times and far from the conservativism i thought existed in the so called innocent past all in all i felt that the cast characters action scenes and view of history depicted in this movie were first rate
<START> i was surprised that forgiving the did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues you know little issues like religion sex and the truth lots of comedy's seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations many leave you thinking i know they ripped this off from some sitcom this film takes off on its own unique direction i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film
<START> i can't believe i missed this one made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a tv soap this is 90 minutes of sustained sharp as a knife film making you will find the outline plot etc elsewhere on this site consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single hand held 16mm camera all the dialogue is improvised none of the 'actors' had appeared in front of a camera before it sounds like a recipe for disaster instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the california desert in what evolves into a 'that's not fair i'm on that person's the only problem is the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one brilliant quite brilliant
<START> sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to be totally believable the movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never in a million years go out wit ha guy like that also people in movie had lackluster performances there acting was so bad also the plot bad they could have don e a better job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really boring after the first few jokes it was like was laughter then the old when is this gonna end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie
<START> i watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like michelle i've been wondering where michelle is now there has been times where i had to find my mother in places i was scared to be but more scared to leave her there to see michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom and what i want to know is where did matt and tracy tear that ass up worst scene for me was watching tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room u never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except michelle has aids where are they know 2008 can we get an update
<START> holy this movie rocks the duo of chris farley and david spade are great together my favorite parts are fat guy in a little coat oh my gosh room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come this movie has a huge cult following i wonder why which proves that even eleven years after chris tragic death and he still is popular he plays tommy which will make you laugh every time you still watch it he is a great comedian and is missed mr spade reminds me of dan while chris farley reminds me of john belushi they done more than 2 movies together this movie is a must buy and should be in every snl fan's collection
<START> this film entered production before ww2 began but was not released until it was well under way with significant fascist sympathy in the us and chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser the great dictator was a very courageous endeavour such risks in film making thinly veiled political statements would be almost inconceivable today imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the usa's foreign policy br br this film is hilarious poignant and tragic the tragedy is that chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end but it is already to late for him and for us a must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history film making politics or as an art form
<START> believe it or not the mona lisa actually got stolen once and was missing for nearly two years in 1911 leonardo da 'la better known as the mona lisa was taken from the louvre by a petty thief and former louvre employee who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native italy his actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit of course he had no hope of finding a buyer the mona lisa was quietly returned to the louvre on the very last day of 1913 remaining there ever since except for occasional loan outs when lupin was released in 1932 twenty years after the theft most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie lupin is quite enjoyable with mgm's usual high production standards and jack usual briskly efficient direction this movie does not lack for pleasure what it lacks is plausibility br br john barrymore is the master criminal of the title he specialises in perpetrating 'impossible' crimes which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance but of course he always commits the crime and fools the tully marshall has a good scene as one of barrymore's victims lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises which enables barrymore a u s a' ham to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery john's older brother lionel barrymore is the javert like detective sworn to catch lupin br br karen morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities on screen she was most impressive in working class roles that fitted her own political beliefs such as her fine performance in 'our daily in lupin naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone and she's all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy br br spoilers coming eventually lupin decides to steal the mona lisa from the louvre he slits the painting from its frame rolls up the canvas and then smuggles it out in a flower basket we see john barrymore casually brandishing a tightly rolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history i had to laugh at the filmmakers' error in real life but not in this movie da vinci painted the mona lisa on a plank of wood so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up br br eventually captures lupin and him off to le the scene between john and lionel barrymore in the police car is sheer delight as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters' dialogue i would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors as it is i can't imagine anyone but the barrymore brothers playing these roles well maybe dennis and randy quaid but just barely br br don't look for a good plot line here but lupin is a delightful example of old style movie making i'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10
<START> previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing it isn't inglorious its disgusting br br i absolutely hated inglorious basterds the entire point of a film is to entertain if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit it is extreme boredom or disgust br br the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table before thankfully they are all shot i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes even woody allen knows when to shut the f k up br br this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark but in other films i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking here i couldn't care less all of quentin's films display an enormous confidence particularly jackie brown but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film br br is it violent sure there's torture and galore but you'd have to remind me thankfully the film was so thin i didn't even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on br br he's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel but do us a favor qt and spare us the movie br br i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die hard fan he or she is br br i give it 0 10
