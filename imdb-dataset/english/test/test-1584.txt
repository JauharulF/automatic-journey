<START> this feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent the whole plot is extremely forced especially the gallant effort to save the college from ruin and the moralistic overtone especially by the leading lady grates a bit br br but there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom and the dancing is quite fun especially for alleged amateurs ha ha br br the shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights and i liked peter hayes impressions of charles laughton and ronald coleman as well
<START> this is the most overrated show on television i believe people continue to watch it because they feel they should because it has become somewhat of a cool show to watch and talk to your friends about the next day at work or school rarely does it actually elicit anything more than a chuckle and never provokes any sense of irony or thought from the audience every joke is interchangeable with punchlines that seem to be drawn out of a hat the complete lack of originality combined with the even somehow lamer spin off it has spawned see american dad makes me question the of an audience that continues to keep this horrid show on tv i award family guy no points and may god have mercy on its soul
<START> john travolta was excellent as michael in the movie by the same name i don't think a better portrayal could have been done the movie was funny yet touching michael is a very human angel if their is such andie macdowell is superb in her role as a reporter as she goes from disbelief to belief bill hurt and robert pastorelli are great as fellow reporters each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth each of the supporting cast is wonderful especially the older woman i do not know her screen name who plays michael's mother one of the cutest movies i have seen in years i could watch this movie dozens of times
<START> such a bs movie it's just some stupid anti russian propaganda with a completely bs plot not in any way related to the book br br it looks like the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie than they will ever be able to get from selling the movie the plot of the movie includes references to some of the real recent events in russian and other parts of eastern europe but puts them in such way that has nothing to do with reality it looks like the movie is a brainwashing instrument which helps to portray russia as a place populated by evil people that always dream about killing someone br br an of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of ussr instead of russia when running news reports showing a crowd with ukrainian flags and commenting that it's russian elections etc br br also there are many bizarre episodes i e a character runs though the red square in moscow and in a second he is in downtown sophia bulgaria
<START> the end of suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming peak of the world's oil supply as the world population grows so does demand for oil and power as we extract oil and power we come to a peak in production more oil is demanded less oil is generated the inevitable outcome is conflict and major change br br this film will be disturbing and alarming if you're new to the topic you may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim it should be required viewing beyond politics beyond optimism the math is undeniable br br suburbia is the focus because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets while intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us br br peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by and backwoods crazies this issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think this film is a lucid coherent look at it
<START> this movie was absolute trash the director and stars should be banished from making movies forever the paper thin plot concerns a sleazy director played by the sleazy director now thats acting advertising on the internet for women to star in a snuff movie br br there's no horror at all the girls look strung out and bored the direction is pointless the music is misplaced heavy metal in a library scene and the lighting is awful the director should have cashed in a couple more shopping carts full of aluminum cans and gotten a script sober actors and a few light bulbs as it is this is one disgusting nasty worthless mess of a movie
<START> alejandro alejandro called ale for short works at an auto body repair shop in what has come to be known as the iron triangle a deteriorating twenty block stretch of auto junk yards and sleazy car repair dealers close to shea stadium in queens new york here customers do not question whether or not parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such large they simply put down their cash and hope that everything is on the up and up sleazy outskirts like these are not highlighted in the tour guides but iranian american director ramin puts them on vivid display in chop shop a powerful indie film that received much affection last year at cannes berlin and toronto a follow up to his acclaimed man push cart spent one and a half years in the location that f scott fitzgerald described as in the great gatsby as the valley of the ashes br br for all its depiction of bleakness chop shop is not a work of social criticism but like hector pixote a poignant character study in which a young boy's survival is bought at the price of his innocence shot on location at point in queens makes you feel as if you are there sweating in a hot and humid new york summer with all of its noise and chaos the film's focus is on the charming street smart 12 year old ale who lives on the edge without any adult support or supervision other than his boss rob the real life proprietor of the iron triangle garage performance is raw and slightly ragged yet he fully earned the standing ovation he received at the film's premiere at cannes along with a hug from great iranian director abbas kiarostami br br cramped into a tiny room above the garage together with his 16 year old sister gonzales who works dispensing food from a lunch wagon ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with while he has dreams of owning his own food service van in the city that never sleeps he knows that the only thing that may make the top of the heap is another fender in this environment ale and use any means necessary to keep their heads above water while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and act out the childhood that was never theirs as barack obama says in his book dreams from my father the change may come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have shut off something inside in the meantime ale supplements his earnings by selling candy bars in the crowded new york subways with his friend carlos carlos zapata and pushing bootleg dvds on the street corners while does tricks for the truck drivers to save enough money to buy the rusted 4500 van in which they hope to start their own business br br though ale is a good boy he is not above stealing purses and in the shea stadium parking lot events that camera observes without judgment in chop shop has provided a compelling antidote to the underdog success stories churned out by the hollywood dream factory and has given us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for its characters similar in many ways to the great italian neo realist films and the recent iranian works of kiarostami panahi and others while the outcome of the characters is far from certain makes sure that we notice a giant billboard at shea stadium that reads make dreams happen leaving us with the hint that in phrase the drum of the realization of that promise is beating
<START> music and lyrics written and performed by charlie daniels 'nuff said just don't be expecting anything along the lines of devil went down to georgia ol' charles sorta talk sings through one song early in about the whiskey mountain duh and that's it for lyrics hey though fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the polaroid montage my second hand copy is classified as a family film and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at wimmen the box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was with the promise that you can lose your life or your mind but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and acting natural love that hermit
<START> doesn't this seem somewhat familiar oh wait that's right 90 of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the tv series what's the point in repeating yourself you may ask is it for the benefit of the americans who haven't seen the programme did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot they'd covered this ground already either way for someone who has sat through the first three series this was just really boring i had to turn it off during the that turn your water green' part yes it is very funny but give us something original for goodness sake actually if the best new stuff you can come up with is leonard take on saturday night fever you can forget it br br the guy they got to replace the late richard beckinsale is a lookalike alright but not half the actor personally i would exorcised the role as a mark of respect to him or better yet not bothered making the film at all and just let the hilarity of the tv series speak for itself but no they couldn't do that not as long as there was money to be made sad really 4 10
<START> i first saw this mini series as a child and though i am a child no longer i still love it professional copies are hard to find however when it's on dvd it's mine br br great casting marvellous plots and plenty of action romance and even quite a bit of well placed comedy i'm not a historian by nature but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction
<START> i'm usually disappointed by what the media dubs lesbian movies these days murderous psychotic murderous lesbians women who experiment with other women but end up with men at the end ridiculously good looking women who only get w each other to turn men on etc br br thankfully is on a very high pedestal above this garbage it is a credible love story acted marvelously by every cast member down to the least of the supporting actors aside from having a very engaging central conflict the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to cassidy and hawkins br br i have also seen tipping the velvet but is far superior to the former both in character conflict development and the quality of the acting br br is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch offering lesbians everywhere a great follow up act to bound
<START> the actors cannot act all was plagued with bad accents and loss of character channing tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ever br br the story is nothing new at all some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from you got served and save the last dance i'm not saying that those movies were any good either but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table br br and the dancing there were only 3 dance sequences in the entire movie and 2 of them were taken straight from the commercial perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer but maybe thats what needs to be heard channing tatum is not by any means a b boy his little solo in the parking lot had little style technique or any wow factor all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria all of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls but nothing more the grande finale left me thinking ok now they're gonna get serious all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen br br i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie but step up is no exception to the rule you got served with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect save the last dance was garbage and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years although i was impressed with moulin rouge look to center stage for ballet look to beat street for hip hop
<START> the final part of kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image in red imagery is paramount as well as the obvious but clever color coding however rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look' kieslowski's red is a multi layered densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love in red love and fate are intertwined but complex notions dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by you sense red is really an allegory a reenactment of prospero's omnipresent gestures in the tempest yet it is more than its story appears red demands countless viewings and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure br br although red stands alone as a masterwork from kieslowski it's best viewed as part of the trilogy elements of blue and white are referenced in red which knowing viewers will enjoy
<START> i wonder how many mini cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie it couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car which is featured in this film along with an attractive cast br br this is a very very entertaining heist and chase film it features a cool cast with mark wahlberg charlize theron edward norton seth green and jason statham br br the best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in venice italy the film doesn't overdo the violence has a pretty intelligent script with a few short exceptions features interesting characters and is nicely the cat and mouse game between norton and theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch br br once again however we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as the good guys how many times has this happened since the days of butch cassidy and the sundance kid in the 1960s it's twisted hollywood for you in here one of the criminals norton stole and killed the leader and father figure donald sutherland of the gang so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain also theron's character is in the typically overblown feminist mode of hollywood in which women can do all things including driving a car better than a man a third minor irritation is seth green's smug smart ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool br br despite these hindrances it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex and yes those little cars are cool everyone i've talked to who has seen this film enjoyed it
<START> i watch many movies but presently my genre number one is asian horror i have just bought this dvd and i initially found an intriguing but confused film since i had not understood many parts of the story but i saw in imdb board a message titled explanation of a masterpiece all your questions answered faster load written by and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story i would like to congratulate for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers br br in the end i agree that is a great korean film but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once like this film demands and without the great support of i would not be able to understand the story as a whole i intend to see this movie again in a near future my vote is eight br br title brazil fear
