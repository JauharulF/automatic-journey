<START> i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill br br watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people i have br br been always looking forward to seagal movies and unfortunately i was first disappointed by glimmer man which i found really bad the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has ever br br acted in horribly boring badly edited soundtrack and so on dear reader do yourself a favor an stay away from this br br honestly stay away
<START> wow this is a touching story first i saw dawn' i didn't 'like' it and now i have seen the person dieter about whom this story is being told by herzog very impressing dieter is a driven human being who encountered the most opposite emotions in his live on this earth what an extraordinary life this person has led his tale about the capture by the lao vietcong and thus his suffering is horrifying but what's most impressive is his incredible will to survive how could he find the strenght in a haunting way dieter is telling us in full flowing sentences about his terrible ordeal during his captivity he is a great storyteller and herzog does him the justice this brave man deserves br br in my opinion 'little dieter needs to fly ' tells it all leaving nothing to the imagination thus making ' rescue dawn ' a superfluous film the horror doesn't get more real than in the words of dieter himself he totally succeeds in painting the picture
<START> its really been a long time since the last time somebody created a movie such as like this on a so called b movie maybe it was not a great movie but it is fun to watch classic bruce cambell it has its good parts funny ones disgusting ones even artistic ones br br spoiler ahead br br br br the part where his wife as a dummy robot avenger is about to die i don't know about you but it made me feel so weird so sad and disgusted in a good way i compare this scene with the scene form the fly 2 where his dog as a monster dies makes you think oh my god br br br br no more spoilers br br if you are a bruce cambell fan you definitely wanna have this movie in your collection if you are generally interested in movies you might wanna just think that the movies target is to make you smile gross you out don't worry not that bad though and make you have a good time with your buddies attention i said buddies not possible future girlfriend
<START> hoot is a nice young person's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls the acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop it is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age i thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that the screen these days there is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids it's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed if you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series
<START> i used to work in a video store i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night br br this movie was truly awful there is no redeeming quality about it because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it if the first film wasn't low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit being housed mostly indoors and at night therefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student rather than be mortified the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet he sped up as he approached her that there is nothing to worry about after which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her if this isn't strange enough he wants to perform an experiment upon her bringing her back from the dead and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so br br soft core female nudity and pubic hair is rampant throughout the film and is to be honest the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest like the swimming scene in the first film but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes its just a very very bad film
<START> scarier than any horror movie ever made because you're in controlled of this blood fest which make it more scarier than watching other people doing it on the big screen or on your television screen this game got two cds which make the game much more entertaining br br each cd contains a different character with a complete different story line which make the game much more fun i recommend you to buy this game and the first game too isn't as good as this game still fun though br br br br

<START> to summerize this movie nice for tv but too small for the theatre i enjoyed watching this movie at home but i wont watch it a second time the concept is good but what ends up in the movie is just a summary the end had a 'nice' twist but is still unsatisfying maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasn't worked out like a it should be but then again it's an ok kind of movie
<START> is an animated series about a girl named erotica jones voiced by pamela anderson who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as the tender loins and as a sexy crime fighter known as a k a agent 69 who works for a government organization as erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and cheapo a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun the creator of the character and the series is stan lee of marvel fame and creator of spider man br br back in late june of 2003 spike tv then known as the new tnn premiered a thursday night block of three animated shows those shows were ren stimpy adult party cartoon new adventures of classic kids show characters ren and stimpy for adults done by original creator john gary the rat about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring grammar of cheers and fraiser fame and the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by pamela anderson and created by stan lee i remember seeing all three of the premiers i was anxious to see ren and stimpy as i love the original show i was a little let down it was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much though gary the rat wasn't bad the best of the three was easily the animation was really good it had an awesome intro song it had some good talent behind it and it was funny as hell the show was just so silly i don't even know how to begin explaining it after four of five weeks if not a little less the animation block disappeared which was weird because i know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere i was disappointed to see go but several months later i found out about new episodes that aired at like 1 00 am i only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and i was glad to see the show back after all that time something seemed a bit off br br in the beginning of it's short run had great animation it was dark moody realistic and somewhat sexy too the costumed looked good too the character was drawn well after the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes the animation was very different instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish received the biggest changes though before she had normal long hair now she had hair bigger than peggy married with children if even possible also the eye mask actually shows her eyes now before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more also the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue that changed to her costume being a bluish violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison in short the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand but the second half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh out loud hilarious it became more zany as well for example there was a later episode about a were beaver yes a were beaver br br anyway instead of complaining about the mid series changes only ran one season but it was a very good show like the tales from the crypt film bordello of blood it may be really campy but it's really fun as long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show i haven't seen every episode because i haven't got the dvd yet for two reasons 1 paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released tv shows even though this was the entire show i would have liked to see some maby explaining the animation change and interviews with pamela anderson and stan lee and 2 the awesome kid rock song during the opening was replaced now i'm not a fan of his but that intro sang was the theme for the show if your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack asses the show also had a few interesting guest stars such as john lovitz as cheapo and mark hamil as the plastic who hates models also tom kenny spongebob was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode stan lee has a cameo in one episode too br br the breakdown br br pros had a great look to it at first funny as hell a very fun show great voice talent for the most part chief watch the show and see some of the stuff he does and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier br br cons the mid series animation change and the crappy dvd described earlier aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times i have nothing really negative to say about this br br overall is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season it was a very funny sexy actioned packed cult series that i hope to see air on adult swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like family guy check it out even if it is on the lousy dvd you will laugh yourself silly br br rated tv ma crude and sexual humor and nudity runtime about 25 minutes per episode score 9 10
<START> i've just been at the cinema in down town prague watching this film br br not due to the poster i found very old fashioned heroic br br style not due to the high level starring which remind me that most br br of those high starring french films are usually pathetic but just br br because there are not so many films in my french mother tongue in a br br city like prague and because i love adjani depardieu and br br cyrano then i decided to write up this small comment because i think br br i really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb br br i was not disappointed the film just look like the poster the br br characters are just as stupid as they look like for a while i br br thought adjani would be like a caricature just a funny character br br you can laugh at no she is not for example when she decides to tell br br depardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at the br br beginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat pathetic br br music which should make you cry and realize character is a br br deeper person as she looks like maybe this was humor at the 10th br br level but i am sorry my sense of humor is not that high if i want to br br see some funny french film on the wwii i watch once again la grande br br it is definitively more fun i have also read on imdb br br that lemoine is making a great performance in this film i have to br br say i have never seen a so bad acting well i have never seen any ed br br wood's film nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good br br very costly scenes like the one with the pantheon in the morning br br when the german army arrives at paris or when the refugees settle down br br on a bridge in bordeaux i think is a good filmmaker but br br that he does better with a good script it was easy with cyrano he br br had not to write the dialogs br br i give 1 10
<START> this film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at cinequest in the big california theatre in san jose it's a musical which normally i don't like but i have to say this one was different robert peters who directed the film and stared in it did such a wonderful job during his q a he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in germany i can't say enough great things about this movie the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera work and it shakes a bit if you happen to come across this film check it out
<START> not being a fan of the coen brothers or george clooney anyone can see the skepticism i took into the theater once again someone in hollywood dares to create something different this time it was those for a temporary lack of a better word doing their thing to one of the great works in literary history who would've ever thought homer had this in mind i don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library it is one of those films that you can watch over and over the story is brilliantly written clean and entertaining with a couple of brushes with fame great performances by clooney turturro nelson and a brief but hilarious holly hunter being born in mississippi and raised in other parts of the south i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this they even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south you are not doing anything better this weekend go see this movie br br
<START> staten island filmmaker andy milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood and with this as a dim example of his output i'm apt to agree with them in the ghastly ones we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home located on a conveniently secluded island to collect an inheritance there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murder mystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher the sound is terrible the dialog is otherworldly bad there's some primitive mannequin gore plus some dismemberments and guts and it's technically inept in every possible way it can be inept but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of it's excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion approach with caution if you're not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one
<START> shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british i think dvd label specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies Â mostly italian ones from the glorious eras when everything was possible namely from the late 60's up until the mid 80's the selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of mondo and no shame they probably even borrowed the name of the latter and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like ratman my dear killer killer nun phantom of death and torso the frightened woman was completely unknown to me but since fellow reviewers from around here whose opinions i hugely value described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro sexploitation movies of its era i didn't hesitate to pick it up this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 of the average cinema loving audiences if you're part of that remaining 1 however you're in for a really unique treat the style atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco's succubus and massimo venus in furs yet they're both widely considered as classics whereas the frightened woman is virtually unknown it's all a matter of profiling and good marketing i guess the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion owns multiple old timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life size mannequin doll replica of himself with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street dr sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit but he slowly falls for her just he starts to believe in actual love she strikes back with a vengeance this really isn't for everyone but if you can appreciate moody sexy bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal you can consider this one a top recommendation it's slow stylishly sleazy and totally shameless entertainment all right
<START> the polar express director robert zemeckis i love back to the future forrest gump contact and who framed roger rabbit no question mark after that movie title and tom hanks one of my favorite actors the reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic ebert roeper give it two enthusiastic thumbs up even ebert's written review gave it a full four stars wow ok this i gotta see but wait the motion capture used looks really weird hmm maybe i'm not so interested in seeing this anymore br br well you says the train conductor to the boy in the polar express the boy is reluctant at first and the train begins on its course without him the boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time br br now most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the tv train or rental express hee hee i'm so witty and clever i on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about br br i just wasted 10 and two hours of my life br br i can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach the polar express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny there's no story there's no pay off you sit there through these series of events and you wonder is there any point to all this it'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining but they're not br br this movie is void of any emotion any soul any ounce of plausibility and most of all any fun this movie is not fun br br and let's talk about the way these characters look for a second saying that it's the same technology motion i'm sorry performance capture used to make gollum is a real shame because gollum was believable photo realism just does not translate well in this medium you're using animation why not design the characters to be more expressive or why not just film it all with real actors they certainly could have we as people know all too well how we walk talk interact with things seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable as the incredibles has proved the result of the polar express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets they're moving and talking but where's the heart where's the soul that's what we're seeing on the screen ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh this movie is so horrible br br there's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it he wants to give it to her but you sit there going why just leave it she's coming back he of course loses the ticket and adventure ensues and then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time and they bring him hot chocolate but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids and then there's this annoying know it all kid with the voice of a 35 year old it's all so very disturbing br br oh and there's songs one girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is he's singing a song to himself and then she interrupts and joins in they end the song as they're holding hands looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers very awkward i won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train keep it hot keep it hot the one scene where tom hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably bad scenes in the history of bad scenes br br i have to stop now or i'll just kill myself i need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette yes crappy is better than the polar express br br the one thing about trains it doesn't matter where you're going what matters is deciding to get on br br don't get on this one for the love of god i have decided for you this is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form it happened with the grinch and the cat in the hat and those were horrible also but who can blame them i bet if i took the book the bears' too much junk food and turned that into a feature film it'd probably be pretty dull also but at least there'd be a story and a point which is what the polar express is so lacking of
