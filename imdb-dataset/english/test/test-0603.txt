<START> a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her evasive fiancÃ© this is a much maligned film because of its denouement but up to that point it's interesting well acted eerie and with fine set design by william cameron menzies developed for 3 d projection veronica hurst is captivating and genteel sort of a chic british marilyn monroe still in love with richard carlson who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle there are even bats in the it moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set piece when hurst and her aunt katherine emery also the narrator sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center as a kid i always remembered this sequence there's nothing scarier or claustrophobic than not finding your way out of a 10 foot high maze of hedges naturally the two women get separated setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music the final result is mildly disappointing really since carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings on even provoking sympathy worth seeing
<START> as soon as i saw the ad for on the history channel i knew i'd love it it captured the spirit fantastically you would die if you didn't have mates around you the characters of were strong and each brought something different into the story and the japanese soldiers weren't criticised but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right just as the australians were doing direction screenplay acting and setting were all done wonderfully with a clear easy to follow plot humour was the soldiers' key to survival and it was great to see a mini series about war actually have some sort of humour in it which is usually difficult to do without offending people from what i've read about soldiers in pow camp this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those australian british new zealand american and dutch men spent there i would recommend this series to anyone whether you are interested in war or not 10 10

<START> will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters okay care is about care is about perverts misusing boys in a school and how disgusting it might be if it's a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie care is a movie that could have been but is it because it was a i don't know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some housewifes and fathers who decide not to go to bed there are so many unanswered things in this movie the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more care should have been much much better

<START> like the troll from bluth's a troll in central park lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie we're supposed to like him because he's nice but that's about all he is br br his character design is unappealing the top of his head is a sort of dome that is than the pudgy bottom half of his head br br and penguins should not have teeth i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor gilbert gottfried with his weenie little voice provided by martin short looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak br br tim curry who is usually delightful at being evil does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice not the supposedly menacing main villain br br the entire plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for female penguin marina who is just as dull as both of her suitors br br worst of all is the pacing we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more this time in dialogue this time in song br br barry manilow may be a great songwriter but in animated films like this and his songs feel limp and listless especially the ballads the only song i liked was the 1930's ish good ship misery song br br i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes and that could have caused some of the problems though i suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it
<START> don't waste your time one of those cool looking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a hunch but not even worth that you will not say it's so bad it's good just it's bad the greatest american hero is a writer who rents a cabin on african island called snake island some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off but they are not staying on the island they just stop there to let off the writer then the boat is stranded there and in true hollywood originality the one and only radio on the island is busted so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes like hundreds of them which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere it's not like there ever was one main snake like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes instead there are just a bunch of ham and egger snakes of all kinds of breeds their only goal then was to escape the island as opposed to having to conquer the enemy because there were so many snakes you knew they couldn't possibly try to kill them all and they didn't try i've seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending in snake island by the way every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island it's named snake island for a reason there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat oh they never do get gas by the way they just happen to find another boat on the island already gassed up
<START> despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead character's american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and i'm still not sure what ann margaret was doing there
<START> this proves just how awful the wb network was in the last few years of its existence as a i of course deplore this show for its ridiculous fantasy land obscure unfunny stereotypes about the kids being weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super cool high school students sorry tv writers the world as viewed from inside your ass containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show is not the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality as for those who actually liked this show please dear sweet jesus please rethink the statement that you actually liked this crap over a very long walk the acting is even more hollow phony and wooden than the stereotypes the whole show was built around thank you wb for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its beginning to end misery this show never ever should've even had the privilege of being made no less having so much as eight awful episodes i really hope that these actors eventually got a clue and stopped playing roles in garbage tv shows like this as soon as this show ended
<START> if you want to see a film starring stan laurel from the laurel hardy comedies this is not the film for you stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of those films for another two years if however you want a good travesty of the rudolph valentino blood and sand which had been made the previous year this is the movie for you all the stops are pulled out both in physical comedy and on the title cards and if the movie is not held together by character the plot of movie is used well sort of
<START> one of my desires is to be a film maker and i just have to say there's no way i will be able to compete with the powerful drama the war at home the reason is because the acting is perfect and when you see the movie you'll know what i'm talking about all i can suggest is watching it i got so involved in it and was extremely impressed br br and sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing br br and so was his relationship with his mother kathy bates some of the best scenes include these 2 br br as well as the relationship between sheen and his daughter sister in the film br br 10 10 and definitely in my top 10 i want the dvd
<START> can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime despite betrayal on many levels tom wilkinson is no brutal othello in the setting of modern day england so gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven and we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication and so the web of separate lies begins to fail and then hold together again and life and death goes on despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives how many webs of deceit are to be displayed in this growing tapestry the impulse is to prop up sterling reputations and careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world wilkinson gives an emotional performance full of grace and discretion and decorum and yet humanity of those who have much to hide those who desire clarity and openness on the way to justice will be disappointed with the wickedness of so much deception and yet who among us has not something similar to hide about his loved ones nevertheless the viewer may wonder if this web is fated to crumble some day
<START> although it strays away from the book a little you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings br br the scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene br br northanger abbey looked suitably imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes better br br schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel br br ugh peter firth as mr he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be it's hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression either br br general is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor as for john well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like it br br i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her page boy br br some of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say calm response is stupid too br br anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
<START> this movie is a waste of time though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent the acting in the movie is sub par and has a clichÃ© point you never know what's going to happen tomorrow so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy that sentence saves you from wasting hours of your life on this movie people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before finding that the entire movie was a dream sequence if the most important part of the movie isn't even going to happen at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivating there's a reason this project didn't make a theatrical release and though indy films can turn out very good this one does not even come close
<START> i've seen some bad things in my time a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud a head on collision between two cars a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor human beings living like animals br br but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat br br this film is worse than 911 worse than hitler worse than vllad the impaler worse than people who put kittens in microwaves br br it is the most disturbing film of all time easy br br i used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something br br i shudder
