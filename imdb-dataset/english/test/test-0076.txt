<START> as if the world needed another seagal movie add a bunch of actors who well are not really actors a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget why oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films br br fbi capture two buddies and send them to new alcatraz where the prison's first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests br br first rate acting all around particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys seriously though the director did try and pulled a modern hard edge for the movie the best he could be he went to the well too often and half past dead gets boring too soon what else can you do when the inmates just hang around talking while the hostages continually ask what makes the main bad guy motivated a mindless action flick that amounts to little if not a
<START> there are a whole lot of movies primarily from the 80s that are so terrible that you can't help but love them the last slumber party is one of those i hate this movie so much but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection i have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time it is the prime example of how in the 80s any movie could get released br br our killers name is maniac scary huh is an escaped psychopathic killer running around in doctor's scrubs and a doctor's jacket hacking off people with a scalpel as he goes along he ends up coming across a house of girls that are having a slumber party one of the girls is the daughter of the doctor that tried to operate on and ended up pulling him down in some kind of sexual position lol just watch the movie to know what i am talking about now i know what you must be thinking at this point this must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like slumber party massacre or valentine's day massacre right no this movie is horrible first off the quality of the film changes off and on throughout the film sometimes it will look like it could have been filmed this year but other times it is so grainy and blurry that it isn't even watchable the funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not care at all br br the director played the killer as if that wasn't funny enough but because of the fact that he wasn't talented enough to act and direct at the same time he just filmed one shot of him walking toward the camera with his scalpel and then just replayed that clip over and over every time someone is killed br br the characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikable and these people who are suppose to be ages 16 18 look more like they are 25 45 i know that slasher films commonly use adults as teenagers but i have never seen a movie where it was this obvious my guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they have all died of old age or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again and that is a good thing because i highly doubt that they could have gotten into any more movies even if they tried all i can do is hope that tyler will one day make the last slumber party 2 the final conflict and have all of the original actors return i'm sure everyone would love that br br the movie was directed by stephen tyler no not the singer who never went on to direct again and it was released by b s which i am sure stands for bull and productions bull s only released one more film forever evil which was pretty awful but not near as bad as last slumber party br br a horrible horrible horrible film highly recommended
<START> any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat and on that level the film is amusing but she's horrible miscast as a hill billy her famous new england enunciation slips through making lines like i'd better rustle up some pretty ludicrous she's so pretty and so it almost overcomes this major flaw the story is an old fashioned melodrama and there fore a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940's it has its moments but you might need to be a die hard movie buff to appreciate it
<START> i hadn't seen this in many years the acting was so good as i began this time i thought great another movie i misjudged as a foolish young man but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way br br this was hollywood the seat of glamor so the concept shouldn't be a surprise but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it in brief it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive br br dorothy mcguire is likable as the homely heroine she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make up robert young is injured in the war and feels scarred his parents can't bear to look at him either he seems to have all his faculties and in part the notions of disability are outmoded br br herbert marshall is on hand as a blind pianist his character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient br br the best performance is given by mildred natwick as the owner of the title residence she is bitter and dour but not made of ice her story is much more interesting and believable than that of mcguire and young
<START> i'd give this film a zero if i could how anyone could rate it any higher is beyond me until i saw rollerball this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget claiming mangler 2 or leprechaun in the hood as the worst ever isn't really saying much those are supposed to be bad br br tim mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this non sensical garbage i'm really not sure what happened here the novel was great the director frank marshall had a solid track record with alive and arachnophobia perhaps they should have changed the title to 'africa' the cast was good and the budget was there you'd think someone would have bothered to read the script br br you'd be better off watching battlefield earth again than wasting your time with congo makes you long for the return of mst3k
<START> first off the first thing that came to my mind after i finished this film last night was why the title of 8mm 2 because i saw the first one obviously and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot the only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot because after you see the ending that i will not spoil it just didn't make any sense br br a diplomat and his fiancÃ©e are in hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area she's very attractive so when they see her at a club they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome but things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career they pay off the guy who sent the pictures the diplomat freaks out and kills the guy leading into a murder case he and his decide to find the girl they had the affair with but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into br br what could have been an alright thriller turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie which was sad like i said the title really has nothing to do with the first one so don't fall for it it's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense but it's good for those nights alone because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core br br 4 10
<START> another raquel welch classic this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring raquel welch as michele james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie while on her way there she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles when she gets there she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job however there's one problem the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe now some thoughts on this picture this picture was far better then raquel last and this one had nonstop action luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it as for raquel welch performance the only word that comes to mine is fantastic she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking in fact all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking of course it doesn't matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing i give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons the first and by far is raquel welch who's the leading actress and deserves 10 stars the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end
<START> while this movie did have a few scary moments great use of music and film angles to build suspense it's obvious director ethan wiley and scriptwriter eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine catholic bishop br br amongst the many inconsistencies br br jacob the roman catholic priest when we first meet him outside the church is wearing an academic robe over his rather than the typical or academic robes are commonly worn by protestant ministers in denominations not roman catholic priests br br jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons he attributes it to st paul this verse is not from st paul's writings neither is it in the bible i can't even find it in the gnostic scriptures br br jacob tells his bishop he doesn't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete 180 later that same day within minutes of talking to possessed isabelle sure it's possible but a little unrealistic see father damien as a priest psychologist in the original the exorcist for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skeptic turned believer br br miguel the former priest turned is the first to try an exorcism on isabelle he quotes scripture and she quotes back he says i see you know psalm 65 she corrects him that's psalm 67 they're both wrong br br miguel the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism making the sign of the cross calling on the name of christ applying holy water etc tells jacob he doesn't believe in church and he doesn't believe in god maybe he's just conflicted jacob enlists him to put on home made and have another go at it anyway br br miguel the former roman catholic priest crosses himself backwards or eastern orthodox style as an hispanic roman catholic who used to be a priest he should've crossed himself forehead to sternum left side to right side of chest br br i had to read into the little side stories to get the notion satan was messing with the whole family not just isabelle but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery except for the sheriff it's pretty clear he was guilty br br on the positive side isabelle was creepy in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and i liked the plot twist with claire br br i'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof br br listening to the running commentary with cameron and ethan wiley i'm inclined to believe it was a joke
<START> spoiler alert br br i have never seen comments on a movie that i disagree with more then the comments people made on this one could learn from critical viewings of this movie as an educational film i rate it highly because it teaches how to succeed we do not watch movies to learn we generally watch for entertainment as entertainment i rate it low the ending is downbeat and cerebral intellectual this conflict results in my eight star rating the movie follows jane craig holly hunter a television news producer the network executive introduces tom william hurt to study for the on air news anchor position tom immediately charms people with humbleness another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity aaron altman albert brooks altman knows all news stories inside and out br br the network executive wants on the air and jane argues saying is not ready he doesn't know the news they do not listen to her forced to place on the air jane contacts altman to get information on the news story and relays altman's comments through an earpiece to while speaks we watch the sharp contrast between altman's jane craig's words and as skillfully everything altman and jane craig say in his ear in order to make it understandable likable and entertaining the audience altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from the new guy this new news guy coaching him this is something altman does not see justified but agrees reluctantly br br coaches altman and gets excited noting hundreds of altman's shortcomings in appearance audio and vocabulary altman never considered these things before when he became an expert on the news itself the complexity of understanding what taught him causes altman to have a panicked sweating attack flop sweat when he is on the air eventually becomes the top network anchor and altman prior to being fired but fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig because she finds out from altman that sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him this turns her off of him this sends the message that in relationships we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them br br this movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job but it is especially true in broadcast news there are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of tv news and how represents a good looking but dumb guy or all style but no substance the opposite is true possessed skills and very complex intellect to get people to like him including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds when he is on camera he coaches altman to punch a word in every sentence flaw that costs him the relationship with jane craig is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation many people are calling altman very intelligent or brilliant altman played by is not as intelligent as and the flop sweat scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that handles when on the air altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and suceeded more by getting people to like him there are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the tv news industry the concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs as an education on how to succeed this movie is fantastic albeit unpopular educational yes but it does not have an uplifting ending
<START> this fox spectacle was a big hit when released in 1954 produced with great music and sets intriguing cast it moves slowly but interestingly edmund purdom is strikingly handsome as an egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor juggling three stunning women a jean simmons who passively adores him temptress bella who eludes him and a sister gene who wants him as her pharoah the movie's popularity has not waned since being re shown on amc preferably in widescreen purdom is particulary great his character apparently striking out with the women and ending up never married and a thinker is amazing and tantalizing in her femme fatale role victor mature michael wilding peter ustinov co star check it out
<START> i am a big fan of bad horrors cheap horrors b movies and all that bottom 100 movies and i do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen or even your home video for that matter some of them e g the infamous manos the hands of fate are truly bad and watching them especially on your own without any friends and beer around is a torture for a good cinema taste br br la azteca contra el however was not that bad well of course it's bad it's silly dated corny cheap etc there's an aztec mummy a tin robot a fat masked villain a mad scientist mexican mobsters etc the montage is poor the lines well let's say the lines are not theatrical the fx and sfx are the best what the mexican low budget production could've offered etc etc still the movie is fun it's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time sure it depends on one's sense of humor however i'm pretty sure la should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it please note the movie lasts for about an hour and i think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest br br there's also another thing watching la can give you a clue what was the whole sf horror genre concept back in the fifties when you compare it to the present day matrix era of cinema entertainment i think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved due to the fact the watches like la still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows movies like this are special alright and very often receive a standing ovation
<START> an obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors specially for vincent cassel who wouldn't at the time it was filmed be the first character you think of for such a role and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica beyond the film during this creation i can only say that this film should have been released at it is in the usa instead of thinking of doing a remake it is simply so french almost perverted and yet so true this film should stay untouched br br a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop
<START> julie meg tilly is a goody two shoes type high school girl who determined to prove something to herself allows herself to be subjected to the rituals of the sisters a small scale clique presided over by snooty homecoming queen type carol robin evans the sisters propose that for julie's final test she will spend the night in a mausoleum preparing to drive julie up the wall but not knowing that recently deceased ill intentioned psychic is interred there and has plans to cause havoc from beyond the grave br br while this debut picture for tom friday the 13th part vi jason lives and sometimes they come back is limited by its obviously low budget it's what and his crew are able to do with it that counts it's genuinely creepy unsettling fare it might have very well scared the stuffing out of me if i were under 10 years of age and even at my current age it still got to me to a degree br br some of the effects look cheesy but the decent looking corpses and gore are created by tom burman an experienced makeup effects artist who while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like winston baker and bottin has a good resume with other films like cat people 1982 and the beast within to his credit br br what i liked most about it was a real sense of foreboding and atmosphere an aspect missing from some of the current trendy horror movies being shown in our multiplexes br br tilly is cute and appealing in her role having recently completed her debut film work in tex before joining this production one dark night was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983 where it actually did decent business during its first few weeks the other actors do what they have to do well enough familiar faces in the supporting cast include the equally appealing veteran singer actress voice over artist elizabeth a k a e g daily kevin peter hall for once not playing some sort of creature character but who unfortunately ends up with very little screen time and none other than adam batman west the director's wife nancy who would play in jason lives appears here as the spacey girl in front of the arcade br br it's decent b level horror entertainment maybe too cheap for its ambitions and maybe not that slick hey was just starting out but definitely good for some chills br br 7 10
<START> this film came as a gift a late night offering out of the blue so unlike other reviewers i had no preconceptions whatsoever i found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm its own unfolding i was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as i willed for good to prevail but also forced to wryly acknowledge that sometimes i was on the side of the bad guys the film is quite quite beautiful the word elegiac comes to mind and this more than because the film begins and ends in an far from being depressing or confronting to me the film acknowledges deep suffering and then by its nature with the births and re births as well as the deaths the film celebrates the fact that to quote an aussie poet there is sometimes gladness oh gods i feel as tho i've just written a love letter to this film but there it is
<START> i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels i was hooked from the very first minute nothing is as it first seems lots of suspense great acting from mr van dien and i did not mind the heat in it one bit and best of all you are in for a surprise ending
