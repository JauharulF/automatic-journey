<START> i get the impression that i was watching a different movie to the majority of other people i know who have seen this film it's not really that i found the film offensive or anything just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it i really respected paul work on the million dollar baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was it was clear to me that it was desperate to be the version of traffic but i don't think traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place br br the worst feature of is the way it shamelessly spoon feeds its audience does think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks do need to see the phone book sitting on dashboard address in black can we not be left to make in logic for ourselves br br i also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the i have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high because even though people may not speak this way they certainly do think this way that is irrelevant it is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the in this case highly implausible situations that are set up these characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism br br surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations but by making it the sole focus of every scene doesn't it become innately racist itself characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written it's utterly unconvincing and obvious br br a film should reveal its meaning gradually not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up i can see that intentions with this film were honorable but dare i suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and therefore overcome its flaws i really hope that writer directors will be really careful in future when approaching this style of narrative it has been done well a number of times but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult and robert altman will not be outdone in that department
<START> ben affleck about to be married is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers sandra bullock forcing herself to act insane who is to blame for this inept ugly morass it is so badly edited when i looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name it was to see if the person actually took the credit rife with clichÃ©s contrivances and sandra bullock in raccoon eye makeup the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters laughs are non existent the scene in the gay bar with affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren't so stupid the bar patrons a big rowdy bunch of them shout for affleck to strip and start digging out their cash it's not supposed to have any significance other than getting ben to loosen up a little but the direction of the whole scene is wrong headed and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away or was that all the film he had it's a small moment but it's typical of this film an amateurish piece of pop goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts it is tailor made for the bottom shelf at your video store from
<START> falls into my favourite genre of film historical action adventure with comedy which is probably why i rate it so highly br br the action centres around a highwayman and a layabout who gets entangled with him and his schemes this leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy there is also of course a love interest br br the rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time br br this is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment
<START> joe wes jim adam re acquaint us with the beauty isolation psychological as well as physical and utter terror of murder most fowl in the southwest characterizations settings and plot continually build even if at times the personal asides leave us wanting more with some interesting alternative choices as to who done it flashbacks e g peter fonda good to see him provide clues but they don't go where you might think comic asides e g the preacher are mild and appropriate where and coyote waits start to drag thief engages the clutch and four wheels you around the next corner never quite sure what's there disagree with joe manic comment to jim chee to slow down for the potholes wrong there are no potholes in the plot just tracks to follow on to the next episode great photography as always appealing characters and more to explore
<START> i was recently given this film on dvd as a gift and was unsure at first if it would appeal although one of my favourite actors has a leading role in fact it's on its way to becoming a favourite br br first of all thankfully it's not the same as the book the ending of which i think is excessively melodramatic secondly it's one of the best films i've seen about the first world war what you may ask it's not a war film true we see no battles or no trenches no gas but it shows the cost of war the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it and the impact this had on those close to them br br we first see helen sarah miles a widow awaiting her release from a mental hospital all the women in the film appear to be widows some from the war but helen's much older husband sir thomas we see him later in a photograph was taken ill and died while she was at a party hence her guilt stricken breakdown she is lost and lonely the wire around the hospital grounds evokes pow camps and the trenches like many of the men in the outside world helen is suffering from a kind of shell shock br br out of hospital she has to find her feet in the outside world again a world we experience through her eyes as bleak desolate and unfriendly her mother is unable to provide her with any real support herself a widow she has put up her own emotional defences behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughter's distress like many people especially in that time she seems to find mental illness embarrassing br br the hired driver becomes a supportive presence and helps helen begin to adjust to life again but she does not realise that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her this is a superb performance by robert shaw is a former regular soldier an ex sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has set up his own car hire business superficially he seems tough and strong dependable but there are cracks beneath the surface he has not really adjusted to civilian life he invents for reasons he later explains a family and home life he does not have he has brutal outbursts with colleagues and affection less sex getting close to helen Â a woman whom even with the greater post war social freedom he could not realistically have hoped to marry Â exposes psychological fault lines that tear him apart these days one might diagnose ptsd br br the same is true of the other man in helen's life aspiring politician captain hugh peter egan he is ambitious handsome but also very young tellingly his girlfriend connie caroline mortimer mothers him combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before he goes out he is known to both and helen the former had served under him during the war and helen had met him in political circles and had thought him a popinjay however he and helen now begin a relationship with helen intending to support his political career financially and emotionally peter egan fresh from his stage success as in r c sheriff's end' makes hugh more than an immature cad there is a revealing understated scene in the back of the car between helen and hugh in which they quote brooke's 'the old at she asks of his war experience was it very bad he cannot answer she says well you're back now but his softly spoken reply Â am i sometimes i Â is the key to his character as light and shadow flicker across his face we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words the disproportionate casualties suffered by junior officers of his sort Â straight out of school or university and expected to lead from the front Â are well known in a nervous speech during which helen reassures him to local political folk at a dinner party he reveals that he will stand as an independent no longer as a liberal the party which had taken the country into the war his emotional life is as damaged as he cannot easily extricate himself from connie who depends on him emotionally and financially reading between the lines she is probably a war widow perhaps of a former comrade with a child whose drawings we see on the wall of her home br br spoilers br br the crisis between the trio builds slowly with a frightening scene between helen and in the car and listening in to hugh and connie when he is driving them as hugh tries to persuade connie that even as his relationship with helen develops they can continue theirs that he will at least continue to support her jealousy obsession and his belief that he must protect helen from a duplicitous gold digger lead to confront her and hugh violently in her home br br the ending is entirely different from that of the novel and is better for it it is dramatic but less melodramatic and maintains an unsentimental tone we began with one character recovering from a mental breakdown we end with another suffering one helen one senses is now wiser and stronger than both the men who have been unable fully to adapt to the so called 'land fit for heroes' to which they returned from the nightmare of total war the new ending is open one feels that she at least will cope with whatever lies ahead without illusions in this it reflects well the reality of the time in which women helen connie and so many others had to pick up the pieces of a world in which too many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage br br well you're back now Â am i sometimes i
<START> wow thank god i was on an airplane and could look out the window bad hollywood fire scenes predictable terribly acted who the hell was that awful woman who played the wife badly casted awfully written this movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person who's willing to kneel at the alter of either firemen specifically heroes or gods in general i suppose i just don't have enough bad things to say about this film it couldn't have been cheap either with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes had to have cost a fortune yet it still sucked worse than any movie i can even remember seeing funeral scene astonishingly bad courtship between fireman and aforementioned awful woman corny contrived trite firehouse pranks don't we all wish we could be both so manly and churlish at the same time
<START> a chick flick that guys still like yes wonderful now i can have fun enjoy the company of my girl and not feel like i can't wait until the movie ends light but funny great stuff what ever you do don't miss the dvd extras this a great blind date file too will smith does well in this even though in is light acting he pulls trough it all well the movie is a little slow in pacing don't expect too much action the laughs are there and so is the message but the timing is a little slow use the low moments to whisper or kiss it will pick up the ending makes the feel good moments worth it most of all expect fun light hearted fare and watch for some great upstaging by the supporting actors they make the film the plot twists are predictable but it is a date move so get the of popcorn from the kitchen and don't make her pause it count on more dates after this movie she'll want o see what is next in line remember hitch's advice br br enjoy
<START> i found this film rather brilliant initially i wanted a when animals attack flick along the lines of frankenfish or even rogue but was delivered a truly horrific ordeal that was not devoid of humanity having been to the areas this was made including the croc farm at the start of the movie even sharing the same guide it added to the fear factor those crocs really are everywhere up there though i don't think they had the attitude of this beastie yes there were some melodramatic moments but they contributed rather distract from the whole atmosphere i genuinely cared for the characters and shuddered contemplating what would i do in their boat not knowing where your enemy lurked or the sound of the croc chowing down at night was genuinely frightening i would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors i have seen in years coming close to the descent i give it four alligator handbags
<START> given that roger corman attached his name to this production i had high hopes for this film corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960's i particularly enjoyed his adaptations of poe's stories such as the house of usher ' and the pit and and the which starred the late great vincent price these films had solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments sadly house of the damned ' for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera angles br br house of the damned' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in ireland but it's straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense the director opts to begin running up the body count after a brief introduction to the lead characters a young couple and their daughter the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one event to another which in this film substitutes for coherent plot development the lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted the audience doesn't care what happens to them to make matters worse the events are either utterly clichÃ© or unconvincing due to low tech low budget special effects the soundtrack has been lifted from the omen ' the plot what little there is borrows heavily from and the legend of hell house ' but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincing br br if you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks i recommend you check out classics like the haunting 1963 ' the innocents 1961 or look into corman's early american international films and pass on house of the damned' unless you're masochistic or mindless br br 3 Â½ out of 10 br br rob rheubottom br br mb canada
<START> after a long run in the west end this charming film re cast margaret rutherford as the headmistress 'miss in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950 br br all interior shots took place at riverside studios in london the exterior scenes were filmed on location at a public girl's school near in hampshire during the 12 week shoot both margaret rutherford and joyce were staying in a hotel nearby and would often visit the school during the evenings where they would happily enjoy the company of the real school mistresses br br although the film's script contains only two original lines from the original play the leads and supporting actors are in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic for their predicament especially in the final scenes
<START> this one's as cheesy as they come Â the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the expository dialogue Â then again the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such at which i've never been any good in spite of my love of sci fi movies that it didn't really matter anyway the bird Â first depicted as a mere blurred form whizzing through the skies but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory Â is so sublimely silly that it wouldn't be amiss in a looney tunes cartoon witness the series of intermittently taken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a side splitting extreme close up of its face br br director sears had fared much better with his other film about ufos the fine earth vs the flying saucers 1956 Â with special effects provided by a master ray harryhausen speaking of which i've just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring columbia's recently released se dvd also it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the bird's rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier sci fi classic again the leads are played by genre regulars Â namely jeff morrow from this island earth 1955 and mara from tarantula 1955 as with the afore mentioned flying saucers these titles are highly regarded and beloved by fans Â consequently they are vastly superior to this lamentable addition to the alien monster animal cycle prevalent during the sci fi heyday and beyond incidentally other flying menaces were featured in the flying serpent 1946 which i haven't watched and larry cohen's tongue in cheek updating of same in q the winged serpent 1982 br br unfortunately the giant claw can't even rise to a decent climax Â which is so rushed as to be a wash out to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective that is before morrow realizes that it's shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to figure out a way how to be able to penetrate it ultimately apart from the and frankly tedious technical asides one gets a feeling of so bad it's good watching this after all it only lasts for 74 minutes Â and in any case the bird is such an unforgettably daft creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up
<START> when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the 1990s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and modern life among other fine cartoons yes this includes spongebob all had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiques such as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in it lacks in true wit br br the show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funny especially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny i'm not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse he's just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the show and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointless br br other gimmicks i can't stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i can't bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up i'm talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators that's not wit or even ironic humor it's totally boring and lifeless br br not that the show can't be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspiration br br one last thing the show is not offensive it's only offensive to those who wouldn't watch the show in the first place so it's almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters
<START> this movie was absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot could have been made to work had the movie been written better the acting was some of the worst i have ever seen i was very slow and made me want to leave turn off the movie several times i watched the entire movie in the hopes that the ending would make it worthwhile but it didn't this movie i think should be rated in the negative numbers in my humble opinion
<START> i've always been a fan of jackass as well as viva la bam and and when you're a fan of something your expectations are high to whatever your heroes might star in and if there's one thing i've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to it's never to expect to much 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times you'll get disappointed br br although when i heard there was a jackass 2 coming up i thought not even i can turn down my expectations for this movie and as a result of that i sat down today ready to laugh but also ready to say in the end well it was ok but i'm a little disappointed how wrong was i every single member of the jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves and that's what we love i cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie at some times even shouted in laughter not able to control myself stunt after stunt prank after prank and hilarious comments on the flow it can simply not get any better than this amazing from start till end guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off i've got two things left to say watch it and please god let there be a jackass 3 these guys clearly has a lot to offer
<START> i saw this movie on a show that was showing bad b movies and trying to get you to buy them it basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about after viewing the trailer i thought i would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense it's not entertaining in any sense of the word the film has two or should i say four things going for it and it's not the number of deaths it's the women they are hot and naked a lot and ms lovell could be a legit actress but not in a movie where the emphasis is on t a and corny dialogs this isn't even a horror movie or scary unless you are talking about watching the actors try to act the production value is pathetic the acting is worse and the writing is the worst what was the point in making this movie to scare people to rip off texas chainsaw massacre to try and be funny to show off the women's breasts to put some guy's head into a retarded outfit with fake hands and legs to have a character just say the word snow over and over to not have any real violence but have enough nudity in an attempt to cover up the fact there is no real plot to be able to make a sequel to a movie no one has seen or will ever watch i made a mistake in picking up this movie don't make this mistake too br br stay away from this movie
