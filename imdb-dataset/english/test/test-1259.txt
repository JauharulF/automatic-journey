<START> from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar the film took a while to pick up from the start at least for me seeing as i expected this was a run along america pie flick but it was slightly different a fun loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his own college running it accordingly as you can expect there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick bartleby gaines justin long encourages his students peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately it to the system ' the humour was varied which i loved all the cast delivered fantastic performances hire this one out with a friend it's a bloody crack up
<START> this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish this is a movie about lawrence newman who lives in brooklyn in the 1940's at the time of wwii one day when he gets himself glasses people start thinking he's a jew and that only because he looks like one and he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood so some people start treating him like dirt they make that judgment being a jew of larry's fresh wife gertrude hart too that makes their lives unbearable neal focus 2001 is a fairly good look at the that's a problem that won't go away the movie is based on miller's novel which i admit i haven't read but the movie is really good so i'm sure the book would also the actors do good job william h macy is always good and his work as larry newman is brilliant laura dern is gert hart and she's magnificent meat loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary david character as the jewish shop owner mr is the most sympathetic in the movie paymer is the perfect choice for the role one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr and newman fight against those nazi like people with baseball bats they join together to fight the evil the christian and the jew
<START> should i have expected anything other than putrid from carrot top this was on of the worst movies i have ever seen it is by far the worst comedy i have ever seen chairman of the board did not add humor to my attitude rather it enraged me that's right carrot top is such a bad comedian that i became enraged that this man is making movies
<START> compared to this tarkovsky is a speed freak br br compared to this bela tarr is mtv br br compared to this the movie russian ark is a roller coaster ride br br i've just described 3 of the experiences i've ever known and this one tops them all but that's not saying it's bad on the contrary i really liked it but it was a chore br br i won't describe the plot because you can easily find that elsewhere suffice it to say that the plot is insane it's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since becoming john malkovich i believe the interesting plot is the main reason i kept from nodding off also the humour was nice that's something we rarely see in slow artsy films br br here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm most movies have little plot little substance yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of images to keep us enthralled but the hole has 100 plot theme without much to please the eyes in that respect i suppose it's a truly intellectual experience much like reading a painfully verbose novel like vanity fair which i've never been able to finish br br if you have a tremendous attention span i think you'll really like this film despite its pace it's highly creative and imaginative it's like jean pierre jeunet on quaaludes and with a drab dusty camera lens best of luck
<START> until today i thought there only three people including me who considered heaven's gate 1980 to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western since the 1970 after little big man 1970 johnson 1972 the outlaw wales 1976 and the long riders 1980 br br i was stunned and pleased to see that 22 5 of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10 as do i a recent book the worst movies of all time includes heaven's gate through it's production and release it was vilified as no movie since cleopatra almost twenty years before at one time it was considered the most expensive over budget movie of all time surpassing even cleopatra it was blamed for the downfall of its studio united artists until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling michael cimino fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess but clearly that was petty jealousy at its worst br br cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking
<START> i loved this movie the first time i saw it it gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air notably jane craig rushing kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off and then joan cusack struggling to get it in and william hurt who according to jane commits an incredible breach of ethics fakes his tears during his date rape interview a flaw that is pointed out by aaron another high point is when tom uses jane for his own benefits and then turns around and sleeps with jennifer the script is brilliant and the directing is almost as good all three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters especially holly hunter and albert brooks whom is the funniest in the film william hurt is also very good this deserved at least three oscars best actress holly hunter best supporting actor albert brooks and best picture i liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later br br 8 10
<START> back in 1995 barry directed a movie that ended up on many critics best of lists by the time the year's were being printed in entertainment publications the movie was get shorty and it gave lead star john travolta his second big hit in as many years after pulp fiction put him back in front of the lenses based on a novel by elmore leonard the film focused on wise guy chili palmer travolta and his attempts to break into the movie business i for one was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original so much so that when i heard there was going to be a sequel i seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later the sequel also based on a novel by leonard is this time directed by f gary gray who's italian job in 2003 was one of the years highest grossing films couple that with the cast now expanding to include uma thurman harvey keitel cedric the entertainer the rock vince vaughn and james woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's this time round we pick up as chili travolta is leaving the movie business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film thanks in small part to his friend tommy athens woods and the misfortune of his death chili decides to look into the lucrative and dangerous music industry this first leads to the famous viper club where chili meets singing sensation linda moon christina who as lead of an upstart trio can belt out tunes like whitney houston that is the whitney before bobby brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar linda is under contract with vaughn who with his overly apparent gay bodyguard elliot wilhelm the rock plan to ensure linda fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means putting chili on ice so with linda's future in the balance chili weaves an interesting web which will include a record producer thurman a gangsta sound mixer cedric the russian mob the police lead singer steven tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing woo that sounds exciting so why wasn't it be cool tries too hard to well be cool but the result is a film that unlike the original has no heart and no soul be cool feels instead like it was directed by a saturday night live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don't string together over a whole movie take for example the scene where travolta and thurman dance together for the first time since pulp fiction as black eyed peas performs live in the background the scene is forced and should have ended up on the cutting room floor instead it is coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the story forwards with any real thrust the concert and the rock's trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual moments that don't amount to much of a movie when put together but those aren't the only issues with the sequel which could probably be renamed product placement with the amount of 2 ways and diet that seem to stare at you more intensely than serious look the story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a movie poster of sylvester stallone's on the wall no characters is above offering us anything we haven't seen many times before and in much better films with the magic all but gone from the first film we end up with an inferior product that is the second film in the past six months ocean's 13 being the other that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open audition be cool was a major disappointment i so wanted it to be the get shorty of the new millennium and i ended up with a film where the outtakes must have been a gas but experience left me with a stinker
<START> it's the br br wow what a skin peeling bad movie honestly this is one of my favorite episodes of mst3k just some things to point out br br 1 the incestuous lesbian mother daughter exchange was weird i do need counseling now br br 2 there is no god there is just dude i love that quote from crow br br 3 whatever did happen to the nuns that took the bus home will we ever know i have a horrible emptiness in my stomach br br 4 lastly don't watch this movie un it has joe estevez as the main star yikes br br 1 10 for un 8 10 for
<START> committed as in heather graham being committed to saving her husband marriage and then being committed to a psychiatric ward in failure to do so what a clever clever use of words br br one of those meaningless wanna be philosophical films in which narration is a series of oh so wise observations that verge on poetry 90s club poetry better known as chit poetry oh it's so je ne sais quoi written directed or by a woman lisa krueger whoever the hell you are this is a pointless lethargically directed road movie full of new age nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are merely seen before or just plain dull the latinos in this movie as part of the poor urban minority are typically glorified in all their mysticism obsessed as a spiritually superior people which is the highlight of this film's political correctness br br the whole affair is lifeless and ceases to be so only when occasional good cast members appear kay place baker wilson on the other hand we have casey affleck who is one of the very best examples of why nepotism is on par with first degree murder as a crime i have rarely seen a more apathetic actor a skinny ugly moron who goes through his lines in a sleepy manner almost as if he were uttering them in a half awake quasi dream plus that weak voice one of the weakest male voices i've heard in my life he must have gone to the tobey maguire lethargy school of acting to cast this idiot in anything speaks volumes about any movie i e about any director or producer hence lisa krueger is a talentless waste of space we've also got that moron who had the lead role in the mst3k spoofed werewolf i think his name is goran but i'm not sure check out his ridiculous accent and the dumb speech
<START> soon after this movie was released salman khan was handed over a 6 year imprisonment read further to know why am i mentioning this br br and i heaved a sigh of relief not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant no more salman khan movies no more his histrionics and no more over hyped acting read overacting br br this movie made no sense whatsoever br br the scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated according to the movie script it would chase anyone but ultimately it finds only salman khan bare chested well this is what happened br br the rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of 001 to believe that then it chases salman khan who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above unless they are paid to do that br br another of breath taking unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and katrina kaif to father and bingo everything is fine and govinda marries br br this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money br br this movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching the plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishing for ex don what a waste of characters br br after this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an oskar hahahah which means i would never watch
<START> directed by jim wynorski chopping mall return of the swamp thing cheerleader massacre is the fourth installment in the slumber party massacre series just think about it it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that no one really cares about so how could this even be good well it's not but since when did slasher films have to be good cheerleader massacre is entertaining that's for sure but in the entertainment field we've seen better that's for sure too as you can see i'm not sure about where i stand concerning this movie those who watch slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied this movie's all boobs but unfortunately no blood or not enough i think i'm being generous with this movie because i had a good time watching it and i really enjoy watching slasher movies even as bad as they sometimes are if you want me to be sincere the slumber party massacre part 1 is the best one and all the others are a waste of time so i guess i have a lot of time to waste for more fun watch sleepaway camp 2 and cheerleader camp
<START> this movie was awful plain and simple it will probably be revered by those who only see films and not movies and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film but i am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring self aggrandizing and painfully drawn out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars br br i was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday br br the storyline is quite a promising one a man is imprisoned for 15 years never knowing his captor nor his crime he is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him however the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as oh su runs around beating people up trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live writhing squid presumably for dramatic effect as there is absolutely no other reason for it all the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown his nemesis a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him hey i know prison has been hard on oh su but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age of all the things wrong with this movie this one seems like the easiest one to fix br br and the big secret the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when i could have been out doing something productive is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school come on throw us a bone here was that really the best they could do i sat through stupid dialogue over acting gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this by the way i'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story but in this case it seems i was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out i was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage br br take my advice do something else with your time and money or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly movie one that you might actually enjoy
<START> in these modern times as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this german count is going to talk politically correct films are the leitmotiv of the modern young filmmakers' projects shoulder arms directed by herr charlie chaplin during wwi the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very bold people certainly to direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible bloody first world war was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to doÂ to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniuses br br as this german count said shoulder arms was made during wwi that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence fortunately not the german fat heiresses of this and it is a hilarious inventive social satire about that and any war the film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though risky and courageous adventures in the front a hero for the or not br br to mock the war trenches the the frontal attacks and the germans how you dare by the way there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film Â the german soldiers by that time had moustaches and longer beards not to mention that the kaiser lacks many medals in his in an elegant funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being surpassed keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent obviously herr charlie chaplin had very much of it br br and now if you'll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must go back to the schloss trenches br br herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http ferdinandvongalitzien blogspot com
<START> the gay desperado is wonderful throughout the banter between leo carrillo and harold huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today best line that would be my third choice diego is obviously the archetype for kevin smith's silent bob lucien n black and white cinematography particularly with the shadows was striking all i can say about ida lupino is thank god for dvd you can go right to the scene where she is trying on and and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again br br lest i forget that nino martini guy sings real too
<START> when a loser teen is bitten by an insect he becomes the superhero dragonfly br br superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens sadly however despite the presence of david zucker who was involved with airplane top secret and the naked gun movies it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have mainly it's more dumb than fun the fault mainly lies with the gags it's simply not funny enough some of the jokes do work such as the nail gun scene but other parts simply fall flat the x men spoof for example or the whole farting sequence blazing saddles this isn't one of the key things about the best spoof movies like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny the cast for the most part play is completely straight this makes it even funnier even when there is simple dialog in the foreground there may well be funny things happening behind the cast again funny the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags on br br the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies then try and spoof them as a result the so called plot of these movies very rarely exist another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene the cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes it's hard to get worked up about it br br as recent spoof movies go it's not as bad as epic movie date movie or the awful meet the spartans but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past it's nowhere near good enough
