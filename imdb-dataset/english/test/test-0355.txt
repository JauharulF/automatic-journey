<START> okay so i went into this loving i still love him her but think a little less this is one gross movie that shows a lot of male genitalia this is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly the only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens even the voices of real women this is over an the top nonstop laugh your rear end off it is so stupid badly made movie i would never watch this again but i do appreciate what the film makers were trying to do there is no rating on this but it would be r or even nc 17 has done much better work
<START> a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie valeria character grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal the other characters are thin probably the writer's fault not the actors' the only exception is as the younger son his energy and bravado are funny and convincing br br i suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town but for me the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way for example when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie
<START> dr sayer philippe leroy a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee maria dagmar lassander a free thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females sayer retreats to his palatial estate running maria through a humiliating series of mind games threatening to molest and kill her desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave obeying his commands adhering to his every wish and whim after resistance at first maria slowly teeters towards his objective but has plans of her own she says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm it seems that sayer has her under his grip agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios such as his toes making love to a blow up doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose which almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with maria and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness maria gains an upper hand toying with lust for her body br br more of a battle of wills a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand through a great deal of the film sayer mistreats maria forcing her it seems to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress it's a typical european art deco kind of palace fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell it features walls and doors opening at his command with an area quarantined off for his victims but once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her and i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy br br i felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally the twist this ideal i couldn't swallow fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen we see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin if he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances br br maria he would later admit is the first he's actually kidnapped others from the past call girls were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman even if it's all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex the spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever know br br all this psycho sexual sub text is rather fascinating to see unravel but dagmar lassander such a yummy sex kitten was my reason for enjoying it so without her i couldn't have liked it as much because she's vital as a victim worth striving to obtain perhaps the film's highlight the delicious dance as lassander clothed in gauze unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score it's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat dagmar lassander must've been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well she has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career even if the film isn't well known i found about through word of mouth the provocative nature of the script and risquÃ© subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex and pain in many different forms the dialogue quite illustrative and at times i couldn't help but chuckle at comments towards an imprisoned maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery in an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey but dagmar is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at it's best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist captured and held against her will forced into a precarious situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist her submission and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him unveiling a possible attraction towards him which in itself might startle some who watch it are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature my other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody
<START> horrible acting with the worst special f x i've ever bore witness too it's bad enough i wasted 3 to watch this crummy pile of crap but it's the hour and a half time i lost that i could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty getting drunk couldn't even help this video br br to put it bluntly i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind numbing work perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if it's written directed and produced by the same person and never ever expect anything of value from jeff fahey
<START> is a unique low low low budget gem from the late 1960's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things paul thomas anderson who named don cheadle's character in boogie nights buck after the eponymous hero of this film and the limited dvd release watching is like listening to hardcore punk rock it may not make a lot of sense at least to me it didn't upon watching it for the first time but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message i didn't understand a lot of things about but for the most part i liked it the more i think about the movie the more it grows on me br br the film is advertised as a parody of new york's madison avenue best known in the 1960's as the advertising capital of the world members of generation x and y may be lost on this concept but fortunately mad men is on tv to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of u s history what you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male and even more largely white establishments br br with this premise in mind the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting the members are predominantly white except for arnold johnson who bears an uncanny resemblance to dick gregory in this film the token african american on the board the board members are so self absorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them their only concern is who will become chairman next without even removing the body from the boardroom they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman br br is elected by a landslide but not because the other members think is qualified voting for was an ill fated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member's chance of being elected chairman with their plans backfired takes charge and sink s the boat firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place br br after this point the film became for me very weird and hard to follow plot wise there may not have even been a plot really the whole idea of the film seems to be a what if scenario with the result being that the new truth and soul inc firm would be unconventional but successful nonetheless the firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes it could be because doesn't trust banks although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film it could also be metaphoric in some way but who knows br br most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency with occasional scenes in the white house with a president who for some unknown reason is a midget my assumption is here that some political joke was being made but i can't figure out what were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small insignificant part of american life were they saying that the latest elected officials nixon at the time were insignificant candidates i don't know i found it a bit eerie however that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president ronald reagan it is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made br br what this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads of course the ad footage possessed a strange funny appeal for its unconventional creativity but did these ads convince people to buy the product if so how the movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the white house however it would have been revealing to see average people since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers br br although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn't stand the test of time this film still had a lot of unique qualities arnold johnson had a magnetic x factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film rough voice was actually director robert downey sr 's voice dubbed in sometimes poorly but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider he hires and fires workers at random but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for the ad agency and seeking out new ideas br br the premise of the film was and still is incredibly risky especially since the film was written and directed by a white man robert downey sr however this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later although some of the sex scenes may be a bit off putting for some viewers the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking many people may not take a positive message away from this movie but i just did br br remains an overlooked movie from a strange era and downey sr even despite his son's recent comeback never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved however if you find a dvd of this movie buy it and watch it if it's on netflix ditto it's a movie that can be confusing at times but is worth watching for its gusto ambition and its non conformist stature even by today's movie standards
<START> sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie but i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster the directing is really awfully bad but after i looked up its information here i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing maybe they don't have budget but anyway ang lee's sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself it keeps pulling me outta scenes maybe someone need to work hard on story line board the dubbed sound is also awfully bad my god normally i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual but this time i am just mad i really wanna hit something hard just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best bad arts its' not even art what is it really hurt people
<START> lucio fulci later known for his graphic horror films like the beyond and zombie was years earlier a master of the italian giallo in the company of argento and bava with films like a lizard in a woman's skin and his masterpiece don't torture a duckling this film has all the elements of the italian mystery thriller genre known as the giallo but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his her own closet this keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself who is killing the young boys in town the young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts the eventual victims the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shot the with a mentally retarded daughter the local witch the town idiot the list goes on and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve the themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect italian style in the early 1970s it is certain that no american studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it as the saying goes they don't make them like this anymore so get a copy and cherish an important film like this one
<START> forget about the plot of this movie forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by vince vaughn and d'onofrio forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring jennifer lopez that i can stomach although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film it is as if salvador dali decided to make a crime drama a must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art i would have to give this movie a 9 10 for it's amazing visual display
<START> i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes almost got cast as the muscle guy since the real muscle guy was really really late that day pauly had my brother and i the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing this movie is really good as well would it have made my top 100 if i wasn't in it
<START> like the 5 year old protagonists of his latest opus hayao miyazaki's enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process miyazaki recalling his earlier works paints a brightly colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors br br voiced lovably by a fish with a young girl's face making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown halloween costume escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface stranded ashore she is rescued by a five year old boy who along with his mom risa yamaguchi resides in a house on the nearby cliff this initial encounter and eventually friendship has a profound effect on who now wishes to become human but by becoming so inadvertently tips nature's balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land with help must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human br br despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of say his most recent spirited away is nothing short of an astounding follow up characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic and of the simple joys and great fears it's a straightforward tale that though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall i will protect you tells matter of factly a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which miyazaki endows his story with artful spirit
<START> 1904 the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence as the various european powers france germany britain russia spain and now the united states are vying for influence in the region the sultan marc is a weak puppet his uncle the who is being manipulated by the french and germans is the real power behind the throne enter berber sean connery the leader of the rif tribe and the last of the pirates who kidnaps an american missionary eden candice bergen and her two children and takes them hostage back in the us president theodore roosevelt brian keith threatens to go to war over the issue alive or dead seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his big stick diplomacy though secretary of state john hay john huston is not so confident however the has less sinister plans for the who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event br br john milius's great historical film based very loosely off of a true story i e was a middle aged man is a wonderful bit of escapism it has some amazing action scenes a witty well written script a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not overstay its welcome like say pirates of the caribbean or the lord of the rings movies it's not really an epic film in the strictest sense but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made br br while the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more pertinent today than it was when made as president roosevelt says america is like a grizzly bear fierce strong but a little blind and reckless at times at the time of the film's setting america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower following their resounding victory in the spanish american war and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove america's worth in real life it didn't quite work out that way but allegorically it works well while written from a right wing perspective milius's screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world he admires roosevelt and his method of big stick diplomacy and correctly recognizes in the words of roosevelt that while america may be feared and respected they'll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do and there are some scenes like roosevelt's target shooting of european leaders and the almost comic surprise attack by marines on the palace which show america's reckless and violent side while others the climactic showdown with the germans show their heroism br br the historical political context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action adventure film there are some brilliantly done action scenes such as rescue of the from double crossing tribesmen which features some of the best swordplay in any film the opening entrance of the and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces and the final battle which combines elements of lawrence of arabia and the wild bunch while a major historical fantasy a three way battle between germans americans and the is a superbly staged adrenaline pumping sequence br br the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film and it shows sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent but manages to pull off his interesting well drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern warfare candice bergen an actress whom i've never been fond of gives a fine performance as the feisty eden who is every bit as tough as her captor brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr you really feel he must have been like this an athletic blustering yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self the scenes of roosevelt boxing and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history and who can forget lines like why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality john huston provides solid support as the weary cautious hay acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt br br among the fine supporting cast the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue and steve kanaly as the gung ho marine captain who cheerfully advocates and carries out military intervention as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation other familiar faces such as roy jenson larry cross marc and darrell also do fine work no matter how small their role spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saint john a fistful of dynamite as the german general and aldo as one of tribesmen br br the wind and the lion is all around a wonderfully done adventure film it has something for everyone wonderful gun and swordplay a lot of humor a tough feisty heroine and her two cute children a nice if romance and an interesting if fanciful political historical context it's not a masterpiece but hey it wasn't trying to be i give the wind and the lion a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation
<START> as bad as they get this film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters the two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would end br br this film is one of the few that was so bad that i had to turn to another channel br br put in highbrow language this film lacks verisimilitude people not even people from ohio simply do not act like this well maybe the writers do br br there is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable br br
<START> these days asian horror films are among the best in the world noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society this is not one of those films instead the record is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of american movies like i know what you did last summer and scream the plot is familiar 5 teenagers accidently commit a terrible crime but cover it up swearing to secrecy one year later they're being stalked by a knife wielding maniac with the unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit it doesn't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group this is one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable and there are numerous stupid plot setups to keep the story going the direction of the movie is unsubtle more influenced by mtv than by current asian horror films like the ring the last third of the movie isn't too bad though delivering some decent suspense scenes though there is probably one twist too many in the end 4 10
<START> the cave got released more or less simultaneously with the english film the descent directed by neil marshall both movies share a similar premise only the cave is dreadfully unoriginal unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is the descent it feels like neil marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas depth and a personalized style whereas the cave director bruce hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk the result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror clichÃ© you can think of and in which most of the violence happens off screen and we all hate that don't we the story introduces a clique of insufferable cave divers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered romanian underground ecosystem hideous winged creatures that also happen to be parasites soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide the first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clichÃ©s and listening to the cheesy textbook dialogs but the whole thing just gets too dire none of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the worst performance i've seen better special effects in anonymous b movies already the filming locations aren't used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks very much not recommended
<START> no one in this movie has very much to do this is probably the longest 65 minutes i've ever spent watching a movie the makeup effects on the pianist with are pretty good but that's the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1 the doctor's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene the director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a mad doctor movie but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them on unless you know someone in the cast or crew i wouldn't recommend even sampling this one
