<START> some twenty or so years ago charles bukowski was a hero of mine i blindly accepted the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films of course i never got to meet the intellectual types that prescribed bukowski as a hero they usually could be found safely behind the counter at hipster video stores and record shops these people hardly talked and when asked a question usually sneered and nodded in some vague direction they were useless when it came to locating a specific title but their shelves were always stocked with strange and unique titles to be inducted in the secret hipster club i believed i had to shed my bourgeois up bringing and espouse the counter culture br br my introduction to bukowski started with the movie barfly the late 80's film that starred mickey rourke and faye i was a fan of rourke at the time he also embodied a sort of modern male fantastical anti hero a brooding intellectual type at the time this appealed to me hero scoffed at convention a mid 30's tramp who lives life with no ties answers to no one oh and to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob icing on the cake afterwards i read post office and hollywood the later being bukowski's take on his experience with the film now allow me to fast forward to the latest film based on bukowski's book factotum one which i read and enjoyed bukowski takes the form of in this novel i often wonder where bukowski ended and began 20 years after barfly the fictional movie bukowski is still the same i have watched about an hour of the movie and i have yet to see signs of the facade cracking here is why factotum bukowski was my hero is handsome played by matt dillon he has clean neat hair styled but not over the top when dillon smokes and writes he looks cool goes from job to job ignoring and or fighting with various bosses he screws two floozies one of whom he lives with walks out on only to return to with little repercussion is his own man and we never see him emote he's a sterile one dimensional 30 something james dean archetype factotum lies to the viewer it does so by haranguing the idea of a man a writer without consequence a poor man who's suffering for his art what could be cooler than that now let's say there are some truths to factotum in that the events took place what the audience is missing is the pain that existence maybe the point of this movie and most movies is that for 80 mins we need to escape the world that's filled with consequence and pain and take up vicariously with an anti social womanizer that smokes talks drinks with detached coolness one who rejects conventional behavior of job and family my hero used to be movie bukowski long ago that would have worked it was easier then now i have yet to claim a hero things are not as easy hipster logic and movie renditions of counter culture icons offer no solutions or even ask questions
<START> ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet they know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at albert hall in london br br the movie is rich in hitchcockian incidents a friendly but opaque frenchman seems to grill the innocent stewart a doctor from indiana a little too intensely to be merely idly curious later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise a knife in his back and whispers some information about the murder plot to stewart stewart tells his wife doris day looking very saucy indeed but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life br br instead the couple try to track down the assassins buy them off and get their son back taking them from morocco where hitchcock has given us his usual tourist's eye view of the customs locations and food to london there is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set to between stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop the staff are more concerned about guarding their half stuffed specimens than anything else and they shuffle around holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish in the course of the scuffle stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger the action boosted along by bernard hermann's bumptious score the scene ends with stewart rushing out the door hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion's head gaping at the slammed door there is also a running gag well done about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in london waiting for things to be explained br br there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on one is the relationship between stewart and day which is not as rosy as it ought to be considered as a bourgeois ideal she's been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known and she's given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc that's understandable in say a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right it isn't delved into but the edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe dimaggio and his then wife marilyn monroe who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea oh joe she gushed did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer seventy thousand muttered joe former hero of the new york yankees br br the second problem is one of allegiance who is of greater social value one's own young son or an unknown ambassador do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the albert hall her solution opts for allegiance to political stability although her motives are problematic does she scream to save the ambassador's life or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her cf alec guiness falling on the detonator at the end of the bridge on the river kwai the photography is extremely good and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of london it's mid day and stewart is alone and determined but frightened too there are footsteps echoing on gulliver street from someone somewhere is he being followed is his life in danger and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him br br the director had a rare disagreement with francois truffaut while being interviewed for truffaut's otherwise laudatory book truffaut argued that the earlier version of the man who knew too much lacked the depth of the later version hitchcock replied it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional no argument there br br this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenith
<START> honest to god the outline pretty much says it all the planet not to be confused with aunt jemima is represented by a cheap l a stripclub there's no strippers so the most recent male visitors go off to recruit strippers br br the men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl girl sex scenes and eventually as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere the women become convinced that men are good for something well not the men who made this movie at any rate br br but boy do we get to see a lot of that something in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity this one has less plot then usual for such flicks so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie and grit your teeth if you're into this kind of thing
<START> it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores in fact i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it acting your kidding right direction no a plot no this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie this is often the case with movies of this genre but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth this movie is so empty that it cannot even suit that purpose i have to give this a 1 10 three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is no one should ever watch this for any reason again
<START> my synopsis rae christina ricci was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with ronnie justin timberlake to fulfill her needs ronnie must report to his national guard unit and leaves rae all alone rae is not alone for long because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook up with a man after a party rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road the next day lazarus samuel l jackson finds rae and carries her home lazarus gives medical care to rae and believes that he can also save her from herself rae is like a dog in heat so lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men lazarus has problems of his own because his wife has just left him for another man lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain br br my comment the movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence the film has a different feel to it the story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there the 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic of a chastity belt you don't give love away to anyone but you keep it for your true love the chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen yet rae didn't cook rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not i think craig brewer writer director has made an extraordinary movie and samuel l jackson sings a mean blues song the story is emotionally charged tackling the subjects of race religion music and sex all into one paramount classics run time 1 56 rated r 8 10
<START> pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes however it's just too dull for it's own good all the characters are ok and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real and as a result they were extremely disturbing it's well made and decently written and it started out really interesting but it just couldn't keep up the pace plus i found the ending to be disappointing linnea quigley has no more then a very small role in this so i was also disappointed about that and stephen knight does a good job as the lead as he was pretty twisted plus i got this in a dvd horror set called a taste of evil along with a bunch of other horror films there is lots of blood however it's not all that gory and for it's low budget it was pretty well done however as i said it just couldn't sustain it's interest this is a pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes however it's just too dull for it's own good i would pass but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing better to do the direction is ok elly kenner norman thaddeus vane do an ok job here with decent camera work and doing a good job on it's low budget however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking the acting is actually alright stephen knight is great as the lead he was creepy twisted sick and gave a very creepy performance the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person linnea quigley did well in her small role christopher mcdonald is ok i guess sin his short time rest of the cast are ok as well overall i would pass but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do 1 2 out of 5
<START> having not read the book i was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to their medium which is film not to the letter of literature on this particular film i was happy that the holocaust that occurred in russia and it's neighboring countries finally received some attention the nazis were particularly cruel to russians and russian jews if you read the histories and see the monuments built in and nearby regions you will understand this movie and why many kept silent when they should've spoken up br br it was certainly time for this to be chronicled and i hope that more stories will come out of this it's high time
<START> 15 park avenue well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in however as the story unfolds one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia i would say sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own park its an unending search within each of one of us br br the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sen's terrain shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister who is more like a daughter to her and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman as for the leading actress from guide that's how i can recall her instantly there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there ever dependable rahul plays another pivotal role in the film he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done from a musician in beats to a liberal muslim in mr mrs iyer and so many othersÂ he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well the cameo in the movie is by shefali shah remember satya and monsoon wedding she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease she gives you a glimpse of today's indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's prior relationships br br the focus of camera has been portrayed by konkona she and her schizophrenic world constitute the of 15 park avenue she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience the fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful br br the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the status of a female even in today's modern india and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family and i believe has succeeded to certain extent the helplessness of while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of br br well after i finished 15 park avenue there was a sense of thirst within me i wanted more out of this movie to me emotionally it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema something with a strong purpose
<START> i like movies that show real people americans and tell truth the movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it it played here in norway fine amazon says above that it's usa but the box states all regions i have to say it is not for the american viewers it played in here in world raw views a theater i saw it and later i ordered it the cut was different and much better see it and you will like it or maybe hate it sorry bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense get angry and hate it disagree with everything in it but i for one stand by it it's not for the empty minds it is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense i loved owen's words and the poem made me cry
<START> patty was years ahead of most successful screenplay and drama writers in tackling sticky subjects in this 1971 film he followed sinclair lewis and a j in respectively arrowsmith and the citadel in looking critically at the world of medicine although his target is centered on a special stage a modern hospital in manhattan point of view is quite direct are hospital's places for people to go to to get well or are they money making organizations where people frequently die due to incompetence br br as a person who has recently been to a hospital too many times and will shortly have to return again i find the hospital a very timely and rewarding satire george c scott is dr block one of the heads of the manhattan surgical center a major teaching hospital he has just started his day when he is told that one of the second year residents has died during the night in an apparent mix up it seems he was sedated and drugged while sleeping on a bed he'd been having a tryst with a nurse and someone tampered with an i v that should have contained water with in it later it turns out he got an overdose of in the i v soon scott finds that whenever he turns around some other member of the staff dies of a heart attack or of a botched operation the key to all this appears to be one patient who came to the hospital ten days before for a regular check up and has since lost one kidney nearly lost his other kidney and is now in a comatose state barnard hughes br br hughes' daughter diana rigg wants to bring the comatose dad back to his home on an apache indian reservation in mexico scott is not totally opposed to the idea after all hospital errors almost killed hughes also scott is suffering a mid life crisis with the collapse of his marriage and family and his growing doubts about what his chosen profession really accomplishes it is not only looking at a case like hughes' the hospital is in a constant state of chaos wherein the regular staff scott stephen elliot nancy marchand stockard channing is overworked and and is at war with the business staff typified by frances in a really chilly performance the local community is hostile because of the expansion plans of the hospital but when they meet to discuss matters with elliot they prove to be as divisive among themselves militant black panthers versus local clergy versus birth control seeking women and pro abortion clinic types rigg who falls in love with scott in the course of the film becomes more and more certain that leaving the insanity of the city makes sense and scott also toys with the idea br br scott was at his acting height in this film what with anatomy of a murder the hustler dr strangelove and patton under his belt before the hospital was made his angst registered when he and rigg get to know each other she prevents him from killing himself due to his despair he can't tell if anything done in the hospital is worthwhile and screams out the window the words in the summary line though he does later relax a little about how good his teaching has been for doctors studying with him scott really never fully is sure about it all he does however fully accept his own sense of responsibility that others just dump rigg too was at the height of her international fame if not her acting abilities her stint as mrs peel on the avengers was a few years old but she was recognized as a leading stage talent in britain at the time as well as one of the sexiest women performers of that period br br the supporting actors are good too besides the chilling demanding insurance information from comatose patients in the e r there is hughes as a religious maniac who wins and elliot as the fed up head of the hospital there is also my favorite caricature richard as dr is a butcher who has found a real home for himself on the big board of the stock exchange having incorporated himself for tax incentives anyone recalling his performances as ethical types such as the head of the law firm in l a law or as the friend and physician to melvin douglas in being there upon seeing his greedy dr see another facet to this underrated actor's talents
<START> hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio no no on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney pixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories br br the story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea sprite goldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world the human child lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern japan based on seto island where he lives with his young mom lisa yamaguchi names the strange goldfish and takes it to the daycare nursing center that lisa works at is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat by sampling some blood from a cut on finger br br yet just as and begin to develop a bond is taken back by her father fujimoto who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the world's oceans br br desire to become human has become so strong however that fujimoto is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see br br during her breakout unintentionally releases fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding town desperate to resolve rebellion he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife mother the water elemental mother lady of the sea yuki br br as with his past films miyazaki's no no touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans the opening sequence is at times sobering when encounters a vessel which is scraping the ocean's floor uncovering mountains of garbage and debris one can understand the anger and frustration of the character of fujimoto who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavor br br enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film it is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious clearly miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination the art style has the appearance of crayon pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful it is almost like a child's color book come to life br br child actors and do great work as and they bring adorable charm to their roles in particular sounds so darn cute as that it is little wonder that falls for the magical girl former campaign girl model and actress yamaguchi no otaku is also very good in her role as modern mom lisa i was a bit confused at first by her character as i initially thought she was older sister it also didn't help that kept referring to her as lisa rather than mom but i guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern japanese family in the anime series crayon also refers to his mom by first name as well br br 80s comedian sounds totally different as the serious fujimoto but wisely doesn't make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing while we don't get to know his character more former pro baseball player and actor who portrays father koichi also delivers some nice voice work the opening theme no by japanese soprano masako is simply beautiful and stirring in contrast the and no no theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional japanese nursery rhyme during one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like die br br the film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of and takes a back seat to some of miyazaki's overwhelming fantastical visuals i also had wished we had more time to explore fujimoto's back story as well as the relationship between and his father br br like kiki's delivery service majo no howl's moving castle princess and my neighbor totoro no totoro no no is another miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes like a modern day fairytale the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come
<START> sorry to repeat myself over and over but here's another great columbo episode i guess that's why i'm such a fan most episodes really are great the best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are possibly the youngest ever columbo villains br br after watching a lot of episodes where columbo and his adversary act like close friends it's good to see an episode where tempers fray and bad feelings rise to the surface it just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite columbo is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues he happily plays along deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them underestimate him but of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloney br br the murder itself is another complicated one along the lines of the bye bye sky high iq episode with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with a seemingly watertight alibi in the intervening years between 1978 and 1990 the technology has moved on from record players and firecrackers to remote control car locking systems and hidden cameras br br stephen puts in a great performance as justin rowe the obnoxious spoilt student gary is low key but good as his yes man friend cooper redman and it's nice to see robert culp as mr rowe justin's dad br br a very satisfying episode in all ways
<START> this is supposed to be charlie's masterpiece but i will contend that it is actually one of his weaker films first of all it's not funny not one thing in this movie made me laugh okay there's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle but that was one of desperation the first and only talkie where he speaks he sings in an earlier film but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in modern times and gold rush two films that are at least ten times better than this film there's literally only one good scene in this film the one where hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball that's it br br okay so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war even long before we entered the war nope not true simply not true so that praise can be turned down a bit the three stooges did it on january 19 1940 with you spy ten months earlier than the october release of chaplin's film and that movie was actually funny if you want to watch chaplin's greatest film watch this only for reference and then pop in modern times gold rush city lights limelight the kid or even tillie's punctured romance
<START> the most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash the was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out the troubling aspect is the way that it the wholly unsavory tactics of the fbi and the unamerican activities committee secret informants gossip turned into accusations searches these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the kgb did and presumably what the good patriotic americans were fighting yet the fbi did them and didn't bat an eye that's the only realistic part of this movie and they present it with no sense of shame at all add to this undermining the constitution itself by having only communists invoke the bill of rights the film also makes thinly veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was communist inspired another pack of lies it's extremely difficult in this day to excuse such outrageous propaganda even understanding the paranoia of the times when one realizes how damaging it was to real people then
<START> this is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie remake a classic film shot by shot i hope nobody tries this technique again in 1998 good will hunting director gus van sant tried it by remaking hitchcock's 1960 classic psycho and failed miserably what on earth was van sant thinking of this remake doesn't even come close to topping the original the few changes that were made here were no help if you want to see psycho the choice is obvious see the original br br out of four
