<START> have you ever wondered what its like to feel free i am sure that each one of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage hari om shows the audience what freedom actually means in this film freedom is described in the form of style represented by discovery of india discovers her inner true love when she is in a rickshaw journey with mr hari om she looks at life differently and portrays freedom that every woman restricts in herself when she is in a relationship br br this film is definitely worth a watch and i saw this the first time in dubai international film festival and i left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction br br watch it
<START> i have fond memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child in the late 70s early 80s on tv now upn 9 in ny though a product of the swinging 60s this film has hardly aged the effects are just as wonderous as 2001 and in some ways superior the model work is flawless with an attractive cast great color photography and set design and an evocative score is a winner
<START> i love this movie it has everything bonnie hunt did a fantastic job co writing directing and co starring in this film david duchovny is just plain hot and minnie driver is as cute as ever combine all that talent with david allen grier carol o'connor robert loggia richardson and jim belushi you have a oscar worthy movie i'm surprised they didn't get one if you haven't seen it go rent the dvd watch it once then put directors commentary on bonnie hunt is fabulous
<START> i loved this movie oh my gosh this movie rocked so hard i found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it which btw mentioned the fact that elton john covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about i thought it sounded interesting and i was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film br br what controversy i thought to myself as i put the tape in the player i was curious i get and my expectations were certainly met i loved it i guess it is a really girly kind of movie but it was so sweet and adorable it was a beautiful romance although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in 'the graduate' which i thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they did br br ok so it wasn't entirely conceivable for these two kids to run off and live on their own but it could happen in a fantasy br br but the ending just sincerely ticked me off i was so mad with how they ended it it sort of leaves you hanging and i suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequel but at the same time i'm almost hesitant to see that since sequels are almost never as good as the first br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over it's an awesome movie awesome
<START> watching this film made me wonder just why was universal putting out films like this they had a wonderful string of films with all the classic horror films the dawning of the atomic age brought on an onslaught of giant creature films spiders ants praying with the deadly mantis we have a giant praying mantis flying around the arctic scaring eskimos and being hounded by the armed forces the bug reaches a tunnel in new york where the soldiers eventually destroy it of course this is all made much more watchable by viewing it on mst who thought it was a good idea to start the film out by showing a giant map
<START> says that baltic storm is banned in sweden that is not correct instead you can buy the film almost everywhere like in gas stations shopping malls internet of course and so on often to a very low price because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it despite all the tricks to keep up the interest the movie only appeals to conspiracy theorists psychos and other persons living in la la land and those who knows the truth br br working on a museum with the estonia disaster as a theme i have meet them all i have heard about every theory that exists like cocaine smuggling weapon smuggling biological warfare nuclear smuggling red mercury aliens the russian the american the estonian the swedish and the finnish intelligence often in different combinations br br some normal persons have asked why we don't show the film a question only asked by them who haven't seen this terrible nonsense movie br br once again baltic storm is not banned in sweden it has some entertaining qualities but what a hell is donald sutherland doing in this movie
<START> this is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end the acting was bad the plot was worse and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class dennis weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part my advise don't watch this movie
<START> ok if you would judge the movie to now a days it wouldn't fit in to well if you watched fi now the stage and everything was pretty cheese i agree but weren't all the movies in the 80's like that gilligan but too the people born in the early to mid 70's or earlier it has a cult status the plane was on approach tattoo would run up the tower ring the bell and with his accent would yell da plane boss da plane and you would wonder what everybody's wish would be people who are born in the mid 80's or later wouldn't understand the because if you watched it now it don't have a harry potter jurassic park computer animation fx it was just a stage where you probably could even almost see the wire attached to a guy who's wish was too be able to fly but to us during that time it was a fantasy island
<START> two years after ' took off jim abrahams jerry and david zucker cast one of its stars leslie nielsen in this hilarious television series a glorious take off of old u s detective shows such as nielsen played frank america's answer to it had the same style of humour as ' clever visual gags in the background unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters such as johnny the shoe shine boy who seems to know everything about everything guest stars including william shatner were killed off in the opening credits 'police was the first u s sitcom since 'batman' to lack a laugh track many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made but i think it was about right the concept could never have sustained a full 24 episode run five years later 'police made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the 'naked gun' trilogy was released jim jerry david and leslie had the last laugh
<START> many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian horror films a trend which has admittedly grown dull however it has produced some true classics and a tale of two sisters for me at least stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time br br based vaguely on a korean it tells the sad story of two mentally troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes as the story takes several twists and the scares become more emotional and quite real by the end you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic one to watch again and again if only to work it all out
<START> how in the name of decency did this film ever get made br br one presumes the subtitles merely say 'awful' on every single frame of this truly dismal effort br br horrendous acting woeful dialogue and the lack of talent from everyone involved in this nightmare make for an excruciating 90 minutes br br overall impression br br a bunch of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made br br this makes hammer horror tv shows look like oscar material br br and don't for a second think this falls into the 'so bad it's good' category it's not even that bad br br but the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look
<START> i think that new york times film critic elvis mitchell wrote the best one line review of in the mood for love when he said that it is dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever how true those words are truly romantic films are so rare these days while films that include plenty of sex and nudity which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner abound so given this cinematic climate wong kar wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air in the mood for love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors mr chow played by tony leung and mrs chan played by maggie cheung whose spouses are having an illicit affair as they try not to be like them but after hanging out with each other on lonely nights while their spouses are away on business taking care of a sick mother they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation of going too far br br several factors are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among romantic melodramas in the best sense of that term first the specific period of the film i e 1960's hong kong is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail the clothes including maggie cheung's lovely dresses the music e g nat king cole and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period second christopher doyle's award winning breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous meticulously composed frame make no mistake about it in the mood for love was the most gorgeous film of 2001 it should also be mentioned that wong kar wai's usual hyper kinetic visual style is understandably toned down for this film although his pallet remain just as colorful third there is the haunting score by michael which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of e g chan walking in her elegant dresses chan and chow glancing at each other as they pass one another on the stairs and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory the main score which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel fourth tony leung and maggie cheung both deliver wonderful performances leung won the prize for best actor at cannes and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen br br the above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless dizzyingly romantic and in a word magical in the mood for love perhaps more than any other film of 2001 reminded me why it is that i love going to the movies and i guess that is about the highest compliment that i can pay to a film br br
<START> what on earth was that my family and i just waisted 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish there was no plot no tension only a lot of boredom my kids could do better movies with our video camera br br but maybe we just did not get the point of the movie oh wait my mum did she was the only one who liked it for the following reason at least a film with no cars screeching if you are looking for a war film with no fighting in it is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti war message then you should watch the trench br br i give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoon nap and because i am too nice
<START> abe zwick perfected the one off beautifully he never made another film but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self hatred in this film that is both caustic and affecting he commands the screen presenting the crumbling debris of a man breaking down under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life br br paul zwick is an aging queen who's somehow convinced stanley wayne crawford a doe eyed idiot with no sense of the future to follow his star he's a petty thief who's seething hatred has escalated recently he's been forced to skip town and move to a suburb in miami as a disguise he dresses up like a dried up old blue stocking with as much seething sexual torment as the church lady he tells stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his aunt martha paul himself has no friends spends far too much time alone in the house and has to deal with stanley's dissolute lifestyle it would be enough to make any man cross the line into homicidal mania br br again zwick portrays paul as a tragic figure who has utterly lost any understanding of how to relate to other people nevertheless there is a certain poetry in his anguish which burns slowly over the course of the film he's tragic but also elegant this is ultimately a very sad film it certainly has many hilarious moments but there is such an undercurrent of hopelessness and despair that the humour is bittersweet this film is worth watching for the performance of abe zwick he could have really built his career on martha she's quite a gas once you get to know her just make sure you cut your hair and stop your horsing around she really hates that
<START> this film is mildly entertaining if one neglects to acknowledge its numerous incongruities of plot and sheer lack of believability bruce willis as the never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld instead he bumbles about in broad daylight parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises why this man has never been captured before or even identified is beyond me not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring considering the price he demands for his services an exorbitant 70 million his methods are decidedly low budget and stupid br br as for those in pursuit of him they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior they show no sense of expertise instead relying on half baked which sends them traversing across the country at their whim incredibly these far fetched guesses maybe he bought a boat maybe he's in chicago etc etc invariably lead them straight to the who yet again escapes their clumsy grasp br br richard gere whose irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the fbi he actually makes a compatible partner if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals at one point he actually confronts the infamous but unfortunately the fbi although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight fail to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication what kind of operation are they running here br br the film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever the supposedly stealthy acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim's cheek with blood br br the film's action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic and many moments are ruined with melodrama this movie is poorly executed on many levels the one bright spot being the ever consistent sidney poitier avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch it br br
