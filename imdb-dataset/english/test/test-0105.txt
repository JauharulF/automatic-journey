<START> like classic hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse a must see for those interested in french music hall including a song by piaf and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale the dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan br br some might object to the technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets br br consider it jean renoir's love letter to the paris he grew up in certainly the jean renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his hollywood productions br br
<START> this movie is somehow showing 6 2 stars it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain this br br avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth don't waste 1 1 2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano br br there is no story as apparently the director wrote and i'm guessing with a blunt orange crayon the next day's script at the completion of the day's shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is aimless there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial don't you hate ads br br now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work toy love br br so to recap even if you get this movie for free even if you're paid to watch it avoid it br br to paraphrase monty python's search for the holy grail run flee
<START> man i really enjoyed this if only for fred willard's commentary at the dog show there are some dead spots and some gags that don't work but overall the film works very well when i was younger my parents bred dogs and the people that i met at those shows were not significantly less bizarre that the freaks at this show i can assure you br br i enjoyed this film for its artistry and for its commentary about how we tend to take frivolous things far too seriously i enjoyed the acting for its accuracy most of the accents were flawless and its subtlety i loved the way each person walked their dogs br br rent this film if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence
<START> yes that's true that movie is a horrible piece of you know what almost all fans of books in poland think the same the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films it's a shame when you compare and conan the barbarian for example i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare
<START> this late 50s french study of disaffected youth in their early 20's actually grown up but not yet settled down into the adult world probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 french youth don't virtually all youth films made by adults do this the ones that don't river's edge comes to mind are rare indeed but director writer marcel carne of les enfants du paradis fame is too accurate an observer of humanity to not provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters in a sense the details are not important you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self righteous anger of the characters is captured well the young pierre brice and jean paul belmondo are in supporting roles but leads jacques laurent pascale petit and andrea play the roles with subtlety and depth there is also a fine jazz score which you can get on the cd jazz in paris jazz cinema vol 2 unlike some who have commented on the film i don't really see director writer carne as sitting in judgment on these characters he seems as though he is an objective observer to me of course these middle class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some working class viewers of the film and i think carne is certainly aware of this for this american viewer i watched a dubbed fairly literally i'd say version of this titled the cheaters the film provides an interesting window into the france of the 1950s it also is self consciously poetic the scene on the ledge saving the cat is but one example of this and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only french films can get away with i can imagine the heavy handed melodramatic shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an american studio production and the sensationalistic moralistic suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by american drive in exploitation filmmakers i feel that marcel carne has captured the essence of that period between say high school graduation and when by one's early 30s people have largely settled into a routine whatever that routine may be those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties and even if you don't want to do that you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop including the wonderful original score by an american jazz at the philharmonic group including coleman hawkins dizzy stan getz spelled in the credits roy and ray brown
<START> walter matthau and jack lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen this film is just another example of this br br this time out they play two brothers in law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board br br of course their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys it's hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous with the boat's owner rue br br too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o'connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that matthau falls for dyan cannon on board with her fellow gold digging mother the usual outrageous elaine unknown to them matthau has no money either the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven looking lovelier than ever br br the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers
<START> i saw this on sci fi and in retrospect i'm not sure how i actually managed to watch it all the way through this is utter trash it's not a b movie it's a d movie at best br br basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse and sometimes not on one goes killing everything in it's path somewhere in the mid west of america a load of people are missing infact murdered and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them the best part of this movie i'll tell it now is there's some really cute girls let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off slashed apart or hit so hard with a mÃªlÃ©e weapon that the head explodes off that's no spoiler the gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque it serves no real purpose either br br here's what's good the sets look ok the actors sometimes act ok the outfits and props some of them are decent br br everything else that you can think of sucks a lot of the badness is in the editing some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene sometimes the characters do non understandable things and they're always splitting up but not even in a way that the viewer can follow looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that they're splitting up all the time and are ok with it even tho they're in a really dangerous situation and there's bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible most of it is incoherent and confusing and i don't really get how this immortal indestructible bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end and frankly i don't care too much stupid hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and i don't really care to list it all here and they're all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when it's almost laughably bad just awful br br this movie is a complete waste of time there's no excuse for watching this unless the only channel you happen to receive is scifi and you're bound to a chair in front of the tv but if you're not bound you're better off doing a crossword throwing a frisbee or even just thinking there's lots of much better b movies that you can watch br br my senior year in high school my friend and i in visual communication and deign class made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie there was no full movie just a really long trailer and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere it was better work than this movie that really says something about this and i'm puzzled and troubled as to why sci fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can show br br the only movie that i've ever endured that was worse than this is raptor island another brilliant scifi work though it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of worst movies i've ever seen
<START> i'm usually quite tolerant of movies and very easily entertained however this movie was dreadfully disappointing br br i watched this movie after seeing on the cover that william was in it the karate kid bad boy and during this movie i could see that this would be the only reason br br this film is a tremendous waste of the actors talent the music and sound is dreadfully tacky i couldn't believe this of a movie made in the 90's br br i wouldn't really recommend this movie unless you're interested in one of the actors
<START> for everyone who has read this book fanny price ends up maturing into her own woman a beautiful woman with a brain le looks like she is on medication terrible acting she just ruins it henry is a little tall for his character he is also too effeminate mary crawford is brilliant edmond is a little too old mrs norris is hysterical ok this casting decision works rushworth is also perfect yates looks too effeminate also but le is simply horrid this is not a good character for her poor fanny i would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language austen uses in the novel the 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete if they could redo this version with a better suited actress for fanny it would be fabulous
<START> more entertaining than all the gay orgies in 300 combined more heartbreaking than a shakespearian tragedy more poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah and on top of all that the greatest trash ever made br br a black comedy testing the limits of the human senses john cult movie pink flamingos is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation death and of course the eating of dog feces yeah by the way that is not actually the humiliating part no no this is not about the impossible love there are no or on these 90 or so minutes this movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that the battle for the title filthiest person alive br br on one side we have divine played by the cross dressing waters regular umm divine a caring daughter good mother cannibal murderer pervert and current owner of said title she loves her son crackers a bit way too much crackers himself sports a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in threesomes family friend and loyal accomplice cotton gets her satisfaction from watching crackers during some of his acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction last but not least mother and grandmother to crackers edie a 400 hundred pound woman sleeping eating and basically living in a baby cradle she is addicted to eggs and loves the egg man the man who brings the eggs lol br br the four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the marbles cheaters very evil people actually their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnating of young women for the impregnating part they use their trusted and loyal cross dressing butler to provide the semen after that they sale the child to the highest bidder br br it was the envy towards divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families an epic battle of filth perversion and violence br br pink flamingos is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash movie genre loaded with oddities and strange acts john movie is loathed and hated by critics and the average movie going audience but for the few that remain by these generalizations the flamingos is an unforgettable experience funny and sick violent and poetic it truly is an exercise in poor taste
<START> i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams back in the early days at comedy central back in those days the 90's their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k complete with bearded host br br capt frank played by the stone faced dead pan leslie nielson is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists think dragnet meets starsky hutch the show boiled in a flask full of well known police television show plots and scenarios this is distilled 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz for now save it for later frank is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable he is a master of the police investigative methodology a k a ask johnny the old shoe shine boy this does not make him a bad cop cops get lucky also capt notice he's a captain here has perfected it along with his partner and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes br br the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly the magic never came from the sight gags however at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background the movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series think of monty python's and now for something completely different br br if you liked airplane 1 2 naked gun 1 2 3 or top secret then you will definitely enjoy this br br i always liked the series better than the movies even though i saw the movies first why 2 words no o j
<START> so you've got a number of models on an island and one by one they're picked off agatha christie style we get somebody lost at sea pushed off a cliff poisoned by a solvent driven off a cliff blown up etc nothing terribly graphic br br before any of that starts one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask br br the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age br br in the end it's all about business or something br br there's an 80s style montage of a photo shoot most of the bathing suits being one pieces surprisingly a couple are fairly translucent there's camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture the photographer is rather bad at framing
<START> while escaping from a heist of a bank the outlaw vance shaw randolph scott helps edward dean jagger the chief engineer of the western union that is surveying the wild west and had had an accident with a horse in 1861 vance and is hired to work for the western union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from omaha to salt lake city vance and the engineer from harvard richard blake robert young flirt with the gorgeous edward's sister sue virginia gilmore and she chooses vance however his past haunts him when the outlaw jack slade barton steals the western union cattle disguised of indians br br western union is a good but predictable western directed by fritz lang the story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the west facing thieves and indians the entertaining story has action drama romance and funny situations but with the exception of the identity of jack slade there is no surprise in the story randolph scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast my vote is seven br br title brazil os the
<START> after viewing this movie lets say around 8 times the story line has never bored me each character has their own distinct personality and their own views of love this movie has timeless almost realistic love lessons filled with philosophies on love a jazzy soundtrack and great actors is why i would call it a classic
<START> some movies you watch and you say well that made no sense and you don't really mean it you're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical br br bread and circus makes no sense at all and i mean it and that's not because it's surreal from the start it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects there's no script there's no plot there's no story of any kind one event does not lead to the next that's how fundamental the bad writing is here br br so what i mean there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category they want to show you gore they give you gore why even talk about it br br because in this case bread and circus gave me hope okay there are some surreal elements vaginas in the ground people crawling out of them the earth in space two legs on either side these sorts of images are wonderful fun odd crazy but the movie doesn't do anything with them br br stuff happens the movie ends and it's all very unsatisfying i suspect the script was made up on the fly too bad if there had been a story of any kind at all it would have made for a much more entertaining film br br the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own then you lift up the hood and there's no engine just a small man a bicycle br br
