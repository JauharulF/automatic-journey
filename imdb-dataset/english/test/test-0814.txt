<START> two movies the fifth element armageddon the same subject to save the world the same main actor bruce willis one difference armageddon is very inferior to luc besson's film some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay several parts of the movie are showing it i think about the president's speech and especially willis' relationship with his daughter grace at the beginning of the movie he tends to neglect and her and this makes her weary then at the end of the movie it's true love and understanding that shine in him on another hand the movie falls in the following trap michael bay takes his subject too seriously of course the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low level whereas in the fifth element the humor was zany involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action the movie suffers from two other handicaps it often falls into the ridiculous the russian astronaut and almost all the actors are bad used bruce willis is all the contrary of his fifth element 's character he plays the he man he hams it up and sometimes he's unbearable the other actors are barely credible in their own roles particularly willis' sinking crew it seems that this crew is here just for having fun one of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool and poor liv tyler she's at the nasa just to be decorative br br when the movie was released in france in august 1998 bruce willis expressed is weariness of saving the world his weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie
<START> hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first time viewing basis hannibal is bad terrible inept lame droll idiotic contrived laughable and utterly atrocious no pun intended minor spoilers follow br br this movie has huge logic holes more than any bruckheimer bay movie or for that matter any movie that exemplify the indulgence of hollywood exaggeration it's a slick hollywood production designed to cash in on hannibal lector mania directed by so somber he takes this way too seriously hack director ridley scott and produced by a hack italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is doesn't matter whether film is s t money is good br br i can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters david mamet and steven wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good novelist turned hack author thomas harris david and steven well known and immensely talented screenwriters wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks another factor in the disappointment of this film br br there are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e g starling cell phone in the midst of lecter pursuit that turns up inspector as the victim not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by tony hopkins with a smirk and julianne moore ray liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face hopkins gives the true meaning of scenery chewing along with hammy acting by gary oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against lecter br br the gore effect is good but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from hannibal the predecessor silence of the lambs is more believable with tension and suspense suspense is what made silence of the lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller not to mention superbly written and tensely directed the brain dinner sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self parody br br the ending is kinda blatant and idiotic are we supposed to believe that lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you ooh scary br br
<START> i went to see this movie tonight trying to keep an open mind i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book there were considerable differences from the book much like the changes made in the code i went to see the code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film in spite of the changes from the book it was still enjoyable filled with action and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating unfortunately angels and demons disappointed on almost every level throughout the movie symbols are found and figured out quickly without any interest for the viewer they blow past the various symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work the final symbol which was the most interesting and creative one in the book was replaced with the crossed keys symbol in my opinion that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols which is what the langdon character is all about overall this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails at the attempt to be an action movie thriller 4 out of 10
<START> well as the headline suggests this is not the particularly good movie i was hoping it would be i thought it would be great with mr fully monty man himself but tragically not from the beginning i literally lost interest immediately when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out there is random water coming from under the door then bam a full on flood through the route of the house its hard to believe they didn't notice the rising water level outside or at least heard it sorry for this to sound like a rant but it really grinds my gears and has affected me most acting was poor and the story tried to copy nearly every clichÃ© to each disaster movie ever but just failed in that sense cgi was poor i could do a better job using ms paint directing poor too and at the end i didn't care about 1 character at all don't waste your time people no wonder it was released straight to dvd well thanks for reading xxx
<START> this depiction of forlorn japanese forces in the is a tour de force in the utter meaninglessness of war it is an effective representation of japanese pacifist views after ww ii in the movie japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the faced with impending starvation they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left to call this film depressing would be something of an understatement the viewer is left with an utterly despairing sense of life's lost value in modern combat the final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement none the less highly recommended
<START> directed by albert pyun in his awful but strangely hypnotic style crazy six is yet another jewel in the crown for this decade's upscale hugo haas jess franco stylish overdirection incoherent plotting time outs in the middle of action sequences for torch song performances all these seem to be signifying traits for our man pyun most interesting is how he always gets top notch b movie casts compared to wynorski or some of the other video directors ice t rob lowe mario van peebles the very strange burt reynolds ain't a bad cast though they often look a bit confused check out postmortem mean guns omega doom for more top notch pyun mayhem
<START> james joyce arguably could write some of the best sentences in the english language and his short story the dead which ends his collection the dubliners its the most perfect paragraph in the english language it's fitting that john huston who held back in attempting to film this story ended his career with it as with the red badge of courage and the man who would be king huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic and with the dead which was completed after huston's death by his son tony huston we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema br br valuing all that cinema can do as one of the commentators points out this isn't the african queen nor does it need to be this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience all of us through portrait of an artist in school and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us as with silent films huston seeks something pure here and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals joyce's original br br many veterans of the irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with self importance and mock self doubt that's reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the feast of the epiphany what's in store for gabriel conroy is an evening of celebration song dance poetry where he's asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party he's distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earth shattering experience handed to him by his wife while his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past it's also a gift where all that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who are living br br and rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story cinematic huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling it's the perfect solution to a filmmaker's adaptation br br the cast is all we would hope since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience each performer seems elevated by their role anjelica huston as gretta conroy has a wide range to play and her account of a young boy who once loved her sears not only gabriel conroy but the audience as well br br when i think of anjelica huston it's the transformation she makes in this film and when i think of her father it's this film i remember first
<START> maybe i saw a cleaned up version but other than a few flashes of breasts i'm not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring to br br all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments although the end leaves you wondering wtf it was dark but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation br br film quality could have been better but the acting was pretty decent br br all in all a decently creepy and yes brutal movie with a disappointing ending
<START> would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy no how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet what you don't believe me ok yes i made that up it's too bad this movie could have used a sense of humor i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time another movie equaled more money as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton why don't even get me started on stephen lang he was so much fun as the party crasher in 'the hard way' and now this junk br br ah no matter everyone involved should feel ashamed if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed it's twisted but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here flat out the story stinks and we're actually supposed to take this yak seriously makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope seriously i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it's way to theaters br br oh sam waterson how great you are in law order why are you here yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p cosmatos who's directing credits include rambo first blood part ii amongst other gems hmm case in point
<START> not as bad as some people say this is a unofficial bond movie and a remake of thunderball written by kevin co producer in thunderball well the cast is very very interesting maria brandauer is a great bond villain kim basinger and barbara carrera are just like the original bond girls plus rowan atkinson and a truly great edward fox who looks really refreshing in the m role in fact the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses sean connery does it once more confident and charming except that he looks a little bit too old but alright he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role the locations are also typical bahamas france etc the only thing that really fails is the music score the song never say never again is o k but the theme song is just missing all in one a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like moonraker only if there was another story thunderball was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake
<START> from the weeks and weeks of promotion for this abc's the one was supposed to be the real world meets american idol we were to watch these singers perform compete and see how they lived together in a house as well the drama the tension br br where does one begin with this atrocity let's start with the judges who were known as music experts on this program experts implies they have expertise andre at least had a pedigree he was in charge of motown records for a time the other two eh kate hudson's uncle who could have been labeled mr weird beard he dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors i wonder how scary he would have been with a black light and the paula abdul wannabe who did something i didn't think could happen she was even more gushing and cloying than paula she then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode the farce of critiques that these three offered was a true joke and an insult not only to the process of finding the best singer but to the audience that is now quite savvy already having done this numerous times on fox br br there was the host george was no ryan in fact he was as lackluster as can be he actually sucked what little energy there was in the program dry how he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show br br the first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program this was literally a talent free talent show ok perhaps that's an exaggeration and granted the performers all have to be relatively close in ability because if they were not there wouldn't be a contest if only one person was good there would be no suspense so i get that they all needed to be comparable but they all should have had some chops additionally the judges were running a singing academy so the program was part fame as well clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons but you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented and that definitely wasn't what was happening here br br it seemed in casting the show the priority was on the homelife elements as all of the players were very attractive to look at in equal parts to how badly they but the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen so the show didn't capture the events there either br br as badly devised as all of that was the one had an incredible unbelievable fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable br br the audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best just like on ai but then after the audience vote was revealed the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song the music experts based on that performance chose one person from the three to save for the following week and then the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two sending the remaining contestant home br br the design flaw was that the contestants had the final say i mean if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could would you vote to keep the better singer or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival any first season viewer of cbs's survivor could answer that one and that's exactly what happened on the program the person who had the better potential was lost and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all on top of that the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two it was a complete farce br br maybe if they let the contestants vote first at least the experts would save the better of two evils to finish but this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it
<START> i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely it's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didn't think goodman worked in this role although i'll admit that just could be because i'm not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you won't waste too much of your life on it 2 10
<START> for those who remember this video's initial impact it will never be forgotten and a viewing of thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again but while it's a great video it's not perfect even though it seemed like it at the time when this video first came out nobody had ever seen anything like it before now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds and a fresh viewing of thriller will reveal its faults why was it necessary to deconstruct the song when michael jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre he sings all the verses of the song skipping the after he becomes a zombie when it comes time for him to sing again his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears and he sings the chorus again and again and again as if to make up for its previous absence this may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video but it certainly wasn't the last time it has continued to be a problem in the age of mtv the best videos like jackson's billie jean and beat it have used visuals to serve the music not the other way around still thriller is great fun and an absolute must on halloween
<START> having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film this was without a doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen and had no redeeming features br br if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire br br slow no plot no real action nothing approaching good dialogue and i've no idea about the characters what else can i say avoid
<START> i'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history a full length movie made by high school students it shows too but that's part of the charm and appeal get ahold of some of the stuff george lucas did at ucla this is better maybe due to being a group effort br br a monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage these kids were way ahead of their time starts ravaging the town of during a high school dance the monster destroys randomly leaving garbage and smelly footprints br br the movie has local tv and radio people the mayor the samuel high school principal and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents not to mention the mayor's daughter as the ingÃ©nue br br dumb yeah fun yeah great screen writing c'mon they're untrained high copy that comment for the acting cinematography directing et cetera br br is right next to san jose in the heart of silicon valley maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow now there's a challenge
