<START> forgive me but this work of director peter hall is horrendous if you can't get to us with the plot why not kill someone's cat or dog that surely reaches the audiences this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie and believe me i saw it coming before she opened the package how predictable can you get take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way i have never been a fan of de and this performance tells me why overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation i found her rather silly and definitely boring i did like banderas but felt bad that he had to play opposite de he has done much better in other films namely philadelphia where he had some honesty in his dialogue in this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real but the writers green rush did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue please let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment some of us aren't fooled by corny plots bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue seeing her get away with it made me furious
<START> i'm a big fan of surrealist art but this film by bunuel with some ideas from dali left me cold bunuel had a life long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways this is one of the silliest almost like what you'd expect from a smart aleck 18 year old in film class the last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nose thumbing at religion br br if you read the scholars regarding this slow paced occasionally amusing film it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression if that is indeed the point then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies is this behavior the church's fault for interrupting his lovemaking or is he just a jerk i vote for the latter i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame br br there are a few moments where you might cry aha surrealism a cow in a bed a giraffe falling out a window a poor model a man shredding a feather pillow a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or a mud pit hard to tell in b w the rest is forgettable self indulgence unfortunately bunuel was still chasing the same bogey men through the rest of his career discreet charm if you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen check out jean cocteau's early work
<START> the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad although it is the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad it is not funny supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor the secret of their success you might say but galaxina is quite uniquely different it is mst3k's worst nightmare a bad movie in which the intentional and the unintentional humor alike fall flat br br it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail and the reasons are quite varied sometimes it's a timing question sometimes it's a good idea badly worked out the human restaurant could have been hilarious but it wasn't sometimes it feels like there was some in the cutting room with the punchline ending up on the floor and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus it's harder to figure out why galaxina doesn't get any laughs on that count something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie just as something is wrong not at all subtly with the intentional humor it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is it's absolutely unique in my experience
<START> i think i would rather have my piles clipped with a pair of rusty than bear another 5 minutes of this movie in fact i cannot even be bothered to go in to detail not sure how they managed to get the needles into the wooden actors to cure them better off for all concerned if they had just nuked the island after finding out about the virus that way it would have lasted as long as the commercial break and we could have moved on with our lives plus one more thing was this rubbish commissioned by the god channel as all they seemed to do was praise the bleeding lord most of the time avoid like the plague in fact i would prefer it
<START> despite having a very pretty leading lady arenas one of my boy crushes the acting and the direction are examples of what not to do while making a movie br br placed in southern mexico the aztec mummy real aztecs by the way did not made mummies has been up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in mexico city suburbia during the first movie the aztec mummy in this second part the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place a fireplace would have been my first choice br br into this appears the bat a criminal master mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a human robot some idiot inside a robot suit to control and get this take over the world the final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious some of the worst choreography ever witnessed the funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious mexican movie studio br br the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english they dubbed the over acting you should watch this movie through mst 3000 the comments are even funnier
<START> this movie is one big stereotype the acting except philbin harrison is awful and the horrid script only make things worse i must agree with another review that the local characters sound ridiculous as a matter of fact so do the caucasian characters 3 stars out of 10 for 1 philbin 2 harrison 3 surf scenes 1 2 out of watch aloha summer and or beyond paradise for hawaii done right especially bp which i found to be entertaining and brilliant
<START> i hesitated seeing this movie having really enjoyed the original what a disappointment catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film the original had poignant moments perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack no reservations felt like it never connected the food the characters nothing felt passionate in mostly martha the food came alive every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes the smells the textures the food in 'no was in the background rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it it was hard finishing the movie many of the scenes felt awkward see the original it's a truly enjoyable movie the soundtrack incredible
<START> bluff i really think this movie is very good br br is basic a different kind of colombian movie is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen br br it shows a different face o and i think that's very important because colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director martinez and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director br br we need to continue support colombian filming industry because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big
<START> so im not a big fan of boll's work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even br br people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have together along with his legion of schmucks feeling on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf br br three names that actually have made them pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however i find that acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a br br however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr played by udo kier making genetically mutated soldiers or as they are called performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods we haven't even gone far before i started to cry i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck br br there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole albino squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of that's poop for you simpletons from a fa r if you wanna take a go ahead btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen
<START> i thought this series was going to be another fun action series with some dynamic plots and great performances i was wrong while i like jamie denton this show is hardly worth watching at all unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of national security the show is great propaganda for the current government and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day after a couple of episodes it was boring the hell out of me and i started watching reruns of house invaders on instead rather watch csi and without a trace without a doubt
<START> i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap but this is just sad i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original carnosaur i was blown away it was the same damn movie with just some corbin spliced in it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing cartwheels with the word ninja written on their if you haven't seen them check out ninja terminator the thundering ninja black dragon and ninja warriors thanks roger corman you just made me waste a dollar
<START> the time machine starts in new york during 1899 where professor alexander guy pearce proposes to his beloved girlfriend emma sienna who accepts unfortunately just after they are attacked by a mugger emma is shot dead dies in alexander's arms jump forward 'four years later' alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed only a different way this time alexander realises whatever he does however many times he goes back emma will always end up dead one way or another he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth however after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on earth the human like the monstrous that eat the alexander decides to stick around save the br br directed by simon wells who is actually the great grandson of author h g wells who wrote the original the time machine book on which the original the time machine 1960 film was based it is in fact the 1960 film that producer john logan's script is based upon here rather than wells original literally source while all three share the same basic story ideas this remake adds the subplot about alexander's fiancÃ© emma being killed that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever he can the script is a mixture of sci fi action adventure drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much sure there are a few pretty special effects a few nice action scenes the moment when alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save emma is actually quite intelligent makes sense it never really captured my imagination i was never really moved by it either the time travel aspects of the time machine feel very similar to terminator 2 judgment day 1992 in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only the time machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as terminator 2 judgment day the character's are alright although i thought guy pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented made one it works perfectly i reckon the back to the future trilogy offer far more thrills laughs excitement general entertainment value than the time machine ever does while i will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace tells a reasonable story has it's moments i wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good there is also a cheeky little reference to the book original film which are both name checked here br br the benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects in particular cgi which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built new canyons mountains being formed a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon the effects work is good there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good i saw the time machine on telly the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on alexander's time machine dial so i actually didn't know what year he went to apparently director gore took over the last eighteen days of filming as wells was suffering from while the imdb says that the time machine itself was the biggest most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which i find hard to believe guy pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on br br with a supposed budget of about 80 000 000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period new york good effects work although amazingly the time machine was nominated for an oscar for best make up but lost out to frida 2002 the acting is mixed irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make up job that has him looking like a reject from a lord of the rings film while singer samantha makes her big screen debut here is simply terrible although guy pearce is quite good fairly likable br br the time machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable passes an hour and a half but not much else watch back to the future 1985 again instead
<START> deformed aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal formulae for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process she takes it and turns into the beautiful evil magda who goes around seducing and murdering wealthy businessmen br br she dresses very stylishly in late 60s mod clothes and manipulates those around her looking a lot like the late marisa from the film coincidence br br however in spite of all this it's amateurish and sloppy without the james bond pop art that had had even the madrid and lake geneva filming locations don't make up for this br br the soundtrack is by manuel roberto and it isn't bad at all consisting of lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an embellishment perfect for one of those european cds that came out in the 90s br br the retromedia dvd also uses a substandard grainy color print that's in poor shape with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film bull they either didn't bother looking for a better source or they couldn't find one at all there are only a few stills of magda and that's it br br sloppy poor all around this one gets a 3 out of 10
<START> if you take the parents and blend them with the kyle parents you get a perfect blend of over the top and under the edge parenting that you can wish for your own family child skills the best part about each show is that the parents do not come off as pompous self righteous upper class know it alls but at the same time they are not the stereotypical under educated parents who are constantly being bamboozled and disrespected by their children my kids are 20 16 and 6 just about the same ages as the kyle kids and i see so much of their situations mirroring my own experiences with my family the silliness that they indulge in only goes to show that when you have love in your family you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your kids
<START> this is one of those so called hollywood social commentary films that wants to have it both ways and believe me in this film both ways are clichÃ©d and stereotypical stop loss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some anti war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that if you are a man in today's society you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control a quasi frat party animal house extravaganza mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed homo erotic proofs of masculinity this movie had it all in one scene after another of clichÃ©d imagery and then rebellious military deserter ryan phillippe goes on a road trip with best friend's girlfriend an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen maimed soldiers in military hospitals etc and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico but male honor and patriotism win out in the end as all freshly scrubbed and handsome he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate full metal jacket meets sands of iwo jima but in the end john wayne rides again and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its at least it would like to think so as far as i was am concerned just take me back to the more convincing reality of in the garden of
