<START> this is a cheap o movie made by al adamson a man who was perhaps the worst film maker ever even possibly worse than ed wood jr adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves hell's bloody devils satan's sadists and lash of lust it's obvious he wasn't making shakespeare his movies all had rotten production values sensations gore and amateur acting br br here in brain of blood several stock adamson actors such as his wife regina carrol and angelo rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in adamson's previous film dracula versus frankenstein this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood can't help but look good sure the makeup is laughable the plot dumb it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme and acting is level z but it's still better than their last film br br about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor midget angelo rossitto actually had a better than usual part with more dialog and a more important role in the plot and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times as for ms carrol she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick however it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen br br we are supposed to like and be rooting for an arrogant know it all trashy bank robber played by dale robertson and a coy tease played by the extra ordinarily beautiful linda darnell in a fire engine red dress she must have been into that bodice br br a senator in the film thinks native americans and whites should try to come to an understanding the bigots however win the day i could barely sit through the endless dialog of bigotry that issued from the other characters mouths br br except for wounded knee and dances with wolves there are few films that give a positive portrayal of american indians and very few old westerns do this one is exceptionally bad in that regard br br the romance between robertson and darnell set my teeth on edge as he came swaggering in forcing a kiss on her while she plays the old hard to get game br br there are scenes that are unintentionally humorous such as the characters obviously not really riding in or on a stagecoach in several shots br br a puzzlingly humorous incident in the storyline is linda character going to great lengths to purchase tickets for the stagecoach only to then demand a horse to ride minutes later for no apparent reason br br another humorous scene is when the stagecoach comes to a screeching halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road and not only that but then all the passengers pile out for a look see br br 1 star
<START> directed by a veteran hollywood director henry king who began his career still in 1915 love is a many thing was one of his last great films it was based on a bestseller by han called simply a many thing the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem the kingdom of god by francis thompson where that many word love' was used in quite a different and rather transcendental context meaning the love of god made in the the film marked along with works by such directors as douglas sirk and vincente minnelli a sort of renascence of melodrama its and reaching yet again a peak of popularity br br the story begins when a handsome american reporter mark elliott played by william holden yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible roles comes to the hong kong and meets there a young and pretty han jennifer jones of half chinese half english origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the chinese communists instantly mark feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by han's heart left cold after the death of her husband i believe in human heart now only as a but very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell mark and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing even by the fact that mark is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by han's chinese origin but still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence br br undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made love is a many thing features fine performances from william holden and jennifer jones wonderful academy award winning musical score by alfred newman and extremely romantic touching heart warming but ultimately heart breaking story don't miss that many film 8 10 br br
<START> fair and nifty little science fiction horror fantasy thriller about a well known video game designer geller jennifer jason leigh whose latest game not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game but one who nearly kills her and her game too since she forced to stay out of sight is stuck with ted jude law a marketing trainee p r nerd to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth director david cronenberg has well used some bits from his earlier films videodrome scanners the fly etc and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing law and leigh are fine here and so are some of the supporting cast ian holm willem dafoe sarah christopher eccelston and so on that has an international twist to it dafoe is anything but devilish as gas a deceiving garage mechanic one of the movie's best scenes is witnessing ted eat fish and frogs and construct a gun and admit to i can't help myself manages to show that he cronenberg is up to his old tricks and it still works like a charm
<START> god bless randy quaid his cousin eddie in vacation and christmas vacation hilariously stole the show he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a look br br i will say that he tries hard in this made for tv sequel but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really gets anywhere quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets including the orginal audrey dana barron are wasted here even european vacation's eric idle cannot save the show in a brief cameo br br pathetic and sad actually painful to watch christmas vacation 2 is the worst of the vacation franchise
<START> you would have thought given how much this overblown pile of rubbish must have cost that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter instead they seemed to have opted for a bog standard hollywood by disaster movie plot and dialog the only clichÃ© they seem to have missed was the cute kid but every other one is there there's the sullen hero flung together by fate with both his ex wife and estranged father there's the doting dad and the rebellious teenager there's the 'professor that everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he played appallingly by the normally excellent tom courtney seemingly in the grip of some powerful drugs plus the comic duo wandering about in the deserted underground railway br br i sat down to watch this full of anticipation the cast is as noted amazing yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be stuff this useless should come with a warning something along the lines of br br 'this film may have been made in britain but was aimed at the american market it therefore contains tired clichÃ©s stock characters stilted dialogue and a plot so lame brained and simplistic that even george w bush could understand it ' br br avoid
<START> compared to the competition soul calibur 3 is a god amongst games a true piece of art however compared to its 128 bit predecessors the latest in superior slash em up series is over ambitious its attempts to improve on perfection isn't quite successful br br there are new modes and game play tweaks that i commend for trying to elevate the series to new heights but they just complicate things examples well the character creation mode is a great idea in theory but in actuality is full of restrictions and is no way as as that found in the wwe games for example the chronicles of the sword mode is fun and thought provoking for a little while but eventually drags on and a chore to earn money rather than a genuinely fun game also the tale of souls mode which is basically the arcade mode with little bits of inconsequential story and style bits thrown in really feels slow br br omg you don't know what your saying is probably what the more overzealous of you are thinking but don't get it twisted i don't hate this game this game is great its still got that classic game play although some characters moves have been needlessly changed absolutely stunning graphics and that epic soundtrack that the games are known for and also on the good side of things are the new characters particularly who are all cool in their own way except yes i know i'm nitpicking br br its just that compared to soul calibur 1 and 2 it feels like its trying to be much more than it actually is that doesn't mean that its not a classic it just means that compared to its own high standards it falls a bit short despite having more characters moves stages and better graphics than ever br br still soul calibur 3 wipes the floor with 95 of games out there though and that counts for something oh and all those who mark this review as unhelpful clearly feel hurt that i insulted their darling well listen up fanboy girl she ain't real and even if she was she wouldn't be caught dead with you
<START> i saw 2 37 at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it a scene of panic opens this film at 2 37 pm set in an adelaide high school this scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the day to day issues facing teenagers including drugs promiscuity being gay bullying and violence each scene is played again and again from different teens' perspectives and is reminiscent of gus van sant's elephant this is a remarkable film by first time director k it was made with non professional student actors and work shopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors particularly teresa palmer in the role of melody this coming of age film is both intimate and thought provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending
<START> the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece it portrays century paris in grand hollywood fashion yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor and the snow it's constantly swirling about adding to the severity of the setting brilliant the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters including beggars cripples and dwarfs br br a brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore outdone only by the magnificent conrad veidt who portrays a degenerate dissolute louis xi to perfection and yes veidt picks his nose on purpose pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits
<START> a wonderful story that should be seen by all families the story acting and production values are all first rate i highly recommend checking out br br peter falk is marvelous as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die so he can continue to know how things will end and not be a member of the audience his three children rush to new york to confront him and try to change his mind there are of course unresolved family issues to be addressed and the script and actors handle them well and with great humor br br the story is about a jewish family but it could easily be about any other family well maybe not a wasp family the siblings have issues with each other and also with their father i loved the writing and directing as well as the acting all in all a humorous and touching film
<START> cleopatra is a very funny entertaining show you shouldn't take all the show seriously but if you wanna have fun that's your tv show being made by the producers of xena is a quality guarantee and cleopatra isn't that different from xena the female warriors formula is brought to the future where they don't have to fight warriors or gods but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface and the humans are forced to live underground along the two seasons of cleopatra they develop an interesting and funny underground world and we get to know the three main characters cleopatra jennifer sky hel gina torres and sarge victoria pratt they all are different but as a team they work really well the three main actresses appeared previously in xena like most of the regular guest cast there are some known faces from hercules too or from both shows i specially liked the character played by danielle cormack in xena which is very different from any of her roles i previously knew so if you liked xena and hercules you'll love cleopatra if you don't know them try it i'm sure you'll enjoy it
<START> where do i begin i first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect i was actually at the time searching out films that elijah wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended i sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think i watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film and i was every high and low the film i was riding right alongside on an emotional roller coaster br br it struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels the intense sadness and elation we see in the film the wonder and innocence of childhood the yearning for a time that once was but is no more more than anything this film reminded me of my childhood except for the abuse during a time in my life when i'd shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed i'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it the radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what i'd given up without really even noticing from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself and i did br br this is going to sound corny but basically i rediscovered my inner child i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much so much for the better embracing and living that part of myself i've been finding out who i really am i don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life the radio flyer really did something very special and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects an incredible film br br in closing i cannot fail to mention the music i am a great fan of hans zimmer and this is among his very finest works the sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me like subtitles to a foreign language film his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through find the soundtrack at all costs it was sadly deleted long ago i never expected to find it but amazingly did after chatting with someone i met on a hans zimmer guest book br br watch this film let yourself live the emotions don't get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending be that child again
<START> but i would be lying a relative was a crew member and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days and i was an extra i get to die and have a second of screen time not that i plan on moving to hollywood anytime soon i just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it plus i got a copy of the movie once it was finally released they didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me but the main character cherry is the director's sister so that could be part of it but the cinematography was good
<START> although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute it holds a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint i tend to believe it is the scriptwriter grant morris see dead dog who despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour sorely missing in many of today's box office hits definitely a must see for a sunday afternoon laughfest speaking as a true single girl and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife not my lovelife so much as my slightly crazy lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her she may find someone
<START> four daughters a sentimental story of a solid middle class family with four sisters was notable in one respect into this romantic idealized milieu enters mickey carelessly dressed with an uncompromising attitude to all bourgeois values he really sets the hearts of the sisters his criticisms are not only directed towards those about him but also towards br br one day ann priscilla lane discovers him passionately playing the that's beautiful she saysÂ it stinks he he falls in love with Â and marries Â ann but eventually realizing that their basic incompatibility is leading their marriage into disaster he takes the equally uncompromising step of causing his br br the role was superbly played by john garfield and it brought him not only stardom but also and perhaps more important won for him his place in cinema history as the screen's first rebel br br garfield was born in new york's east side of russian immigrant parents and spent his adolescence as a delinquent a real life role that he only when he began to portray the rebel on screenÂ he continued however throughout his life to question and reject certain traditional he was occasionally suspended by the studio and maintained a cynical view of br br finally he ended his career and his life as one of the victims of mccarthy's he was blacklisted by hollywood because of his suspected left wing sympathies and friends claimed that being banned from working contributed to the heart that killed him at the early age of
