<START> this is a great example of what could have been a great film and a great idea but turned out to be really bad in the process i was mainly tempted to get this because of the dvd cover stupid me but i did anyway and i was blown away in a bad sense this movie is essentially about el wreaking havoc around los angeles and it's up to a local animal cop and a writer to save the day before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists bring them down the main reason why i did not enjoy this film was because of big continuity errors that were hard to not notice along with some bad acting okay lighting and nothing scary this movie did not hit me as much as is it probably should have however compared to other movies this one certainly tops the charts just barely br br first off the continuity in this movie is way off and i mean off the shoulders and into the ditch there were so many points were the characters said or did something and then in the next shot they aren't doing it or the change never occurred case in point the main character has a gun the attacks he whips out a flair from nowhere and distracts and the gun in missing the girl runs while he defends here with the mystery flair and she had no gun then the main character is running with the girl and has the gun where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun the time of day gets screwed up one minute it is sun set and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight there were some plot holes as in why was the there what were the scientists doing what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived these things bugged the heck out of me and none of the questions were answered br br next on the list is the acting boy was it wooden and bad the main character played by eric algeria seems a bit too calm at points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy hits his emotion was just not there elina madison who played did a fairly poor job she was the author of a bestselling book about the and she just didn't seem into her role or her performance her acting was kind of laughable and a poor even for an author she knows too much about that thing and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory tony criss was okay but he seemed a bit to calm for some of the stuff that was going on the movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for some crime solving show where the actors and actresses aren't really that committed to their work br br i rarely don't get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing but for this movie i could not help but be harsh on the lighting it took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed there were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more comic bookish but it backfired the worse part is at night when it is pith black outside but the scene is so with light it seems like its day they keep switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes and the lights seem so bright that the actors were squinting it shouldn't be that bright that there are dark shadows at night during the sunset when the lighting was perfect that's the only time when the light was good other than that it was terrible br br there were not scares in this film there was only one time where i did jump but other than that it wasn't scary there were points were it probably could have been scary but it was so damn light out you could see the approach the man but if it was dark it would have been better even the creature design for the was poor it looked good but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit they didn't hide his face they showed him with no sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance there was a fair amount of gore but it seemed unreal this movie just wasn't scary that's all br br overall they did americanize a great south american legend into a blood thirsty human eater which the isn't in fact it was scared of people and it only killed goats sheep dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans but then were would the story be i did not enjoy this film for any reason but i will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions i would not recommend this film to any horror fan but if you like indie or b movies you should check this out also if you are easily tempted by cult classics you'd enjoy this film i didn't i won't see it again but in some deep sedated way i enjoy these kinds of movie just to see what the other side of hollywood is making
<START> i don't mind the odd artsy film but when they are larded with arcane symbolism and murky dialogue and when it's obvious they were done for the filmmaker's ego rather than the viewer's benefit i get upset i'm not a stupid person yet i simply didn't understand what this film was trying to say or do film is a magnificent form of human communication why do some filmmakers use it instead for
<START> darr is an brilliant movie it is 1 of my favourite films srk has done a mind blowing job in the movie br br this role couldn't have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits srk br br srk plays a mental villain in the film br br srk's performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood br br srk deserves an honour and an encouraging appeal for his fantastic performance br br juhi also delivers an excellent performance br br sunny deol looked strong and physically fit in the film
<START> this 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries this follows the same idea as three coins in a fountain a few years before this takes place in new york while coins takes place in rome italy our three beauties are hope lange in her first starring role suzy parker and diane baker lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business namely joan crawford suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason but louis her heart throb does just this sort of takes you back to paul neuman rejecting the gorgeous taylor in cat on a hot tin roof doesn't it diane baker the third damsel in distress meets and dates robert evans before he became the producer and husband to ali macgraw he is known for hope's boyfriend from home played by newcomer brett halsey is promising to marry her she also meets stephen boyd a fellow worker who has interests in our hope all three ladies have their drama ahead of them crawford almost steals the film her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch veteran actor brian plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our leading ladies' back side he's delightfully charming also in the cast is martha hyer wasted in a thankless role never really explored too bad as i like this actress who never seems to get that one role to distinguish her abilities she has a crush on a married man in the office played by donald harron whom i had the pleasure to work with in a couple of shakespeare plays in nyc he is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also br br all in all it's great fun in technicolor and cinemascope directed by jean negulesco
<START> this is one incredibly standard western that features some bad acting dull storyline and silly action br br biggest problem perhaps is how incredibly formulaic this movie is it features all of the usual clichÃ©s yes even a bar fight and the movie really doesn't has any surprises in it it makes this a dull and a weak western to watch also not in the least because it's such a poorly made one br br it's obviously a small production and the movie looks like it got shot in 30 days the directing and editing can be called bad and all of the action sequences featured in the movie are incredibly silly it perhaps almost becomes a bit humorous to watch for all the wrong reasons br br its story also isn't that interesting it's a pretty friendly western so also no blood in which for some odd reason everybody seems to be against the younger brothers who in this movie are being portrayed as good and very friendly guys the story gets sillier and sillier as it heads toward its ending the younger brothers really existed and were part of the james younger gang of which the famous brothers frank and jesse james were also part of of course they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie it just was custom for an early '40's to have likable man characters in it it wasn't really until the western age really that the main characters became rotten criminals themselves really strangely enough that approached has always worked out better than those early western's in which the main character is on the good side of the law br br thing that does make this movie original is the fact that it was shot in color this was something pretty unique for an '40's western and still gives the movie something extra you can wonder though why they shot this western in full color the movie is still done in the style of a black white early western after all and i actually believe that this movie would had been a bit more credible if it got done in black white instead br br you could easily do without this western br br 4 10
<START> normally i wouldn't even stoop to viewing trash like this but since role playing is a dear hobby to me and such was the subject of the film i did it was garbage in so many ways that i do not know where to begin i would rather sit through the plan 9 from outer space marathon than watch another minute of this vomit at least plan 9 didn't have an agenda how the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent extremist agenda as fact is beyond me it is a scary time when a whole group of people can be unceremoniously trounced with no defense and no real facts presented i know this commentary went more social but it couldn't be helped as this movie begged it imagine a pro nazi film being reviewed strictly on film merit won't happen as it sits the people who made this film are themselves and should perhaps move into a communist enclave where propagandizing is accepted
<START> a group of teens decide to take their slumber party to an abandoned school where 27 years prior a horrible massacre took place unfortunately for them the person responsible for the slaughter still lurks the halls of the derelict school and he is not happy with their presence br br this film is not like most modern teen slashers we've seen it's much darker much more suspenseful no wise cracking murderer etc and i liked it for those reasons from a film making point of view it's not great the acting is below average the writing was pretty bad and quite full of clichÃ©s containing randomly tossed in references to american horror films some that didn't even make sense like have you seen scream 3 a girl asks yes i have and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school so it in no way relates to this film but hey it's a slasher flick those are part of the fun also the of characters was heavily exhibited in this film there were six main characters not including the security guard and to be honest only three or four were really used two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke between them i'd estimate about five or six lines total also the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference the pacing however works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases the atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments although the overall appearance is a bit cheap looking due to what i assume is low grade camera equipment and operation the ending though i liked the idea they were going for was fairly poorly done it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with however ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first 98 of the film rather than the ending this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked out especially if you're a fan of spanish and or atmospheric horror br br obligatory slasher elements br br violence gore there's a good bit of blood and gore realistically done but not buckets the violence is extremely well done not to excess but pretty brutal at points br br sex nudity little bit and with the hottest girl in the film br br cool killer well security guards are hardly considered 'cool ' but this guy is pretty wicked his creepy smile was chilling br br scares suspense the suspense is top notch very tense very well done there are also some extremely creepy moments that fused jump scares and the spooky atmosphere br br mystery none at all really br br awkward dance scene of course between a couple of guys and a half unwilling female in the flashback br br classic quote of the film 'one more trophy ' br br final verdict 7 10 this may be stretching it but fans of session 9 might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmosphere br br ap3
<START> bar hopping seems to be trying to be about the stereotypical bar tender and lay shrink serving up pearls of wisdom followed by example vignettes played out by the cast however this turkey is a jumbled mess with a script full of simple minded cliched nonsense hard to follow herky jerky flow unsatisfying and not worth the time d
<START> yes i give it a 10 because i compare it not only to others of it's kind but also to the dreck one is bombarded with on a daily basis in what's laughably called today's popular culture that aside the film is beautifully cast as has been stated elsewhere and gives us a fairly good look at popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries no small coincidence is that many of the plays that played in involved a similar plot boy meets girl someone objects usually the father or some authority figure boy struggles boy wins girl the was actually known at the time as a chauncey act no coincidence too that john ford directed one he called it the quiet man and my wild irish rose is in itself a chauncey act great stuff no anyway great songs great stuff enjoy br br ps after seeing the film i'd like to know more about bill i found an obit that said he quit as a result of insanity replaced as in the film by chauncey and died in an asylum several years later but he had been a very big star in his own right who wrote songs and plays and had plays written for him br br anyone know more
<START> i loved the blood and gore the kind of violence is what alien and predator movies are about which is no one is spared this truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on earth the answer to that is simple we are screwed the effects were beautiful how ever there are some real problems with it br br 1 the acting was horrible on the part of the human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying the writers could have done sooooooo much better the good part was the alien and predator acting which i thought was done very well for the most part br br 2 the size of the predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first movie this i scratched my head on br br 3 predators having their mask on while still in the ship this upset people and i cant understand why its not a plot hole like most people make it to be so i say to you people calm the hell down its no big deal if it will make you feel better remember they did have face on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why br br 4 predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship i thought that was rather stupid on the predators part but then i began to think if it was a younger predator that panicked br br 5 the hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away at least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min so be happy about that br br 6 why did only one predator go i thought this was odd but then i thought that it was because he thought it was only one that he was dealing with and not an outbreak br br 7 why didn't the predators in the ship self destruct well if people were paying attention one did but he was killed before he could completely activate it br br 8 the unlimited blue melting goo i thought that was rather dumb br br 9 predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop that was also dumb br br 10 the black out well come on people an alien and did fight it out at a power station br br 11 being half face hugger queen this really ticked me off i am an alien and fanatic i know for a fact that aliens do not do that just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in out of all the comics games books and the movies 1 2 and 3 clearly shows their behavior they need a queen to lay eggs the eggs hatch into face face infect host the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human a with a predator and runner with any kind of four legged animal and then after living for years upon years then they molt into a a mini me queen that does not lay eggs i can go on and on but i wont but that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me if the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women br br any way if you are going to see this movie just go see it for the aliens and predators and when the scene comes up where the infects that pregnant women close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the alien and universe
<START> the centerpiece of lackawanna blues is the character rachel nanny crosby who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy ruben the narrator of the film based upon the experiences of writer actor ruben santiago hudson the film lovingly recreates the upstate new york boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s br br the first half of the film is virtually non stop music the second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse nanny's ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling him firmly if you ever touch that child again we're going to dance as delivered by actress s that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair trigger temper is frozen in his tracks br br from start to finish delivers a commanding presence her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home this was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast as played by the character of nanny simply radiates love this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come
<START> if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then is definitely the one br br however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then has some serious flaws it doesn't offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas whilst not being quite as clunky br br after two firefights i'm thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely firemen do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the repetition continues again and again up until the end br br a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste
<START> i just finished watching following and i thought it was great i rated it 8 out of 10 i plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order br br i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolan's more recent movie memento following has some similarities this movie was probably the blueprint for memento even the music in some parts is very similar br br shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel the story and dialogue is really good the performance of the actors is believable br br christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget i look forward to his next release insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino
<START> i have just started watching this show its airing in ireland at the moment on the irish television station at 12 30pm in the afternoon as of 26th july 2006 br br this program literally makes me laugh out aloud and i cannot boast that on most apart from uk's 'the office' with ricky gervais in it br br todays episode of 26 july 2006 was the one where carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and doug wants carrie to have no friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his hair ' and licks plates when he goes out to dinner but another funny episode was the other week when the old fella carries dad won on the bingo and that episode me up with laughter especially when they went out and got a replacement fridge and carries father stood there looking at it and thought it was new br br so i don't know how much longer this has got to run on irish tv or at which stage year recorded we are at but i hope it don't end soon because i am really enjoying it br br to sum up there is some great writing some great characters and comedy acting namely by carrie doug and carries father some great punchlines and delivered well a bit saucy and near the mark sometimes send the kids out the room but i think this us sitcom is a winner and very funny
<START> bill roy is the leader of a desert dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people only to have a heart attack himself he ends up dying on an operating table and for the sake of revenge his spirit takes over the body of the title character jill jacobson who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon br br while i know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock nurse sherri is really not all that bad sure it's clear that this was very low budget stuff yet all that i found cheesy about it were the visual effects the acting is not as bad as one might expect either br br there are two different versions available of this on dvd a much more sex oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of t a is the original cut with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their strangest sex moments including one involving fellatio during a college lecture br br the movie would then be re cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly some scenes are dropped with new ones added with stevens the role played by j c wells expanded the movies' most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a and it works quite well this cut of the movie is more interesting overall i would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them br br both versions hit their stride in the final third and benefit from a marvelously scene stealing performance from bill roy as the crazed and a moody climax set in a graveyard although actually filmed in backyard marilyn is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient marcus washington prentiss who's lost his eyes in a car accident and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals the movie also makes amusing use of music from composer harry personal collection including compositions for such tv series as 'one step beyond' and 'the outer br br nurse sherri known by more alternate titles including beyond the living and hospital of terror than any other adamson movie is actually fairly entertaining low budget fare i ended up having a good time watching it br br 7 10
