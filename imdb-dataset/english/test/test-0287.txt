<START> spoiler br br in 1993 african american director actor mario van peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban action film new jack city with posse the film was co written and directed by van peebles who also stars as the main character jessie lee br br plot the film begins at the turn of the 20th century when the united states was embroiled in the spanish american war apparently a time when the u s justice system could send convicts into military service jessie lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man serving with an all black cavalry troop in cuba some of his compatriots include little j stephen baldwin fast talking charles lane and the towering but simple tiny lister they find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it however the ambitious bigoted colonel graham zane finds out about the gold and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it a shootout between the graham's forces and jessie lee's leaves the colonel blind in one eye and his forces retreat jessie lee's ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves and the gold back to new orleans but it turns out that graham isn't far behind jessie lee and his allies are forced to go on the run heading west to a town called apparently was founded by blacks in the years following the civil war jessie lee's father king david was the charismatic preacher who co founded the town however as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks king david was soon brutally murdered by a white mob in a parallel of the ku klux klan terror campaigns that began around the same time jessie lee and company eventually find their way to only to find that the townsfolk aren't exactly glad to see when sheriff bates richard jordan of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants jessie lee and his or alive carver blair underwood is the sheriff and de facto mayor of his own agenda may not square with having jessie lee around br br analysis the action sequences are all very credible and mario van peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero in the aftermath of the success of new jack city it was almost expected van peebles would helm a sequel or at least a similar urban action follow up instead van peebles looked 100 years into the past creating a mostly black western effectively the black themed westerns of the 1970's and continuing the legacy of largely forgotten black themed cowboy films from the early 20th century unlike new jack city the film was independently financed and originally released through polygram entertainment allegedly execs at the major studios balked when van peebles pitched to them some of the more curious casting at the time involved rappers big daddy kane and tone loc as father time and angel respectively in certain interviews mario van peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type in the years since the trend of casting rap singers in non musical films would become almost commonplace keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities black action film veterans like isaac hayes truck turner pam grier foxy brown and larry cook the spook who sat by the door show up as does stand up legend russell not to mention tv producer stephen j cannell who hired the junior van peebles to star in sonny spoon years earlier the film is bookended with woody strode spartacus in a key role
<START> one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author yukio mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex while it is not a literal biography schrader his co screenwriter leonard his brother have taken several incidents from his life including his and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning homosexuality is almost not there due to legal threats from his widow but in spite of this the film is still terrific and one of the best films i saw in 1985 i should also mention the important contribution of philip glass who did the score which adds an additional texture to the film and is superior to the one he did for scorsese's also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar hopefully this film will soon be available on dvd
<START> i'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films the assignment is based on a true story which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen and it really takes you on a fun ride the film has a great cast starring aidan quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley br br naval officer quinn is a reluctantly recruited by sutherland after a chance meeting with kingsley who believes quinn to be the famous terrorist carlos the because quinn so closely resembles carlos sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death br br the training sequences are awesome quinn is really put to the test by kingsley and sutherland having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles from eating the same food each day to being drugged with a hallucinogen he even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way carlos would br br the film has some great action scenes with quinn eluding allies because they believe he is carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the throughout the film quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own will he remain as ruthless and free as carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father br br if you like the spy genre this is a must see the action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes rating 10 of 10 stars
<START> i normally finish every movie or book i start even if they're poor just 'cause i hate giving up on them this was so poorly made i was in disbelief br br i'm not just looking for spielberg magic i rent foreign films and i rent really old sci fi's most recently soylent green worth the rent i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated i could find no redeeming element to this one the action was so wooden i wasn't the least bit on edge the character development was virtually absent you're not left feeling sorry for anyone or even identifying with them finally there were so many pieces that just didn't add up br br don't waste your time better to watch paint dry
<START> interesting plot but painfully dull the script lacks lacks acting to me this film compares with made for tv type movies i was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn i watched this film with my family it is fairly safe to watch with your kids only 1 semi sex scene if you wish to see a young meg ryan check out this movie very 80 ish you will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at christmas booze super glue and tar or maybe you are like me and have have a higher standard for acting in films however i did like the way the movie began and ended mark
<START> what a shame our first movie is so bad hi sham what did you do in this movie it is awful and the director there is no story in this film i had sleep when i was watching this film it is a disappointment and the majority of the crew is not from saudi arabia supposed to be a comedy movie but it lacks the essential elements in comedy br br i know it first experience of cinema in saudi arabia but i expect better from kaif al hal the only positive in the movie is the presence of some talented actors who did not help much text to explode their talents finally to know your comment about this movie guys is it bad or what
<START> i've got to say that i'm not a massive fan of troma films granted i've only seen three of them or four including this one but two blood sucking freaks and mothers' day are widely reputed to be the best which leads me to believe that all the others aren't worth seeing that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day which is a troma take on the over popular eighties slasher while the film is never particularly bad given the type of film it's never particularly good either and by the end all i could think about was 'why did i bother watching this ' anyway the plot sees some girl die on a race track and shortly thereafter more people start dying naturally there are a few possible suspects but it's hard to really care about anything that happens of course in slasher terms it's the gore that is most important and given troma's track record where the red stuff is concerned i was expecting buckets of it there are some decent kill scenes and some of them are gory but it's never very shocking which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar it's worth noting that there's a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley but the rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning the direction plot and its execution are all very mundane and i will say that unless you're a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made don't bother with this film
<START> this film is a good companion to blair witch because it does so much wrong that bw did right like bw this one pretends to be a documentary of ghostly events with each member of the team manning his her own camera br br the sense of reality is never there however the participants are poorly written clichÃ©d characters and the events that take place are equally clichÃ©d the cat jumping out of a closet falling chandelier etc also the stilted dialog and inept improv work by the overly attractive cast detracts from the docu feel and worst of all the supposedly participant held cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely believable actually with some re editing this thing could have been a blair witch parody in fact there is a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge roach on it that is actually pretty funny as is reminding me of a similar gross out scene from austin powers the spy who shagged me but in the end the event is played straight with no punchline it's hard to tell what the intent was with the st experiment other than to glom a few stray bw bucks but it's pretty sad when the only real interest i could find in it was whether the blond historian was going to have her t shirt tied up off her belly in a particular shot or not
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i like prison movies in general i'm not sure why i'm sure some shrink could make something out of it i spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago and i knew then i would never go back i got the individual version of scared straight i did get locked up in an isolation cell on alcatraz for a couple of hours compliments of a park ranger but that's another story anyway the genre really interests me the soundtrack specifically sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones was the perfect backdrop for the film to this day i think of the jericho mile every time i hear the song
<START> a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel waltz into darkness of the writer cornell woolrich it is a drama rather than a film noir which tries to send a message that love changes your own life i e your love to any person and the love you received from him her a wealthy man really changed his life for love while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her belmondo played well as usual while a somewhat still young michel bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent frankly bouquet was not so impressive in this film but less than that was the performance of catherine deneuve she was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover wife of louis belmondo for those who like to visit the world the film offers the occasion to see part of the ascension island and also lyon city in france
<START> i want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english subtitle translation which was actually written not spoken in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist was meant to be self referential in a tongue in cheek manner but if so director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke br br some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique bizarre films because they do so with Ã©lan and unique personal style e g david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story e g kieslowski and david cronenberg's later less bizarre works in x carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it well here it is the pacing is erratic and choppy in particular continuity is often dispensed with superfluous characters abound e g the gypsy mother and child most of the performances are overwrought the lighting is often poor particularly in the oft discussed sex scene unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list goes on br br not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions i liked the musical score even the cacophonous industrial techno music being played in the sprawling abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to andy warhol's of the '60s much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings and even well into middle age deneuve shows that she still has 'it' her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos br br there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as x more charitably experimentation is admirable even when the experiment doesn't work but carax tries nothing new here the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of films later i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe at this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking with the exception of jean pierre jeunet are there any directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore rating 3 10
<START> jack brooks trevor matthews is a college student with some severe anger issues his family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster and now he takes out his anger on everything and everyone br br so when his professor robert englund begins to show signs of he learns he has to control his rage and use it for good instead of evil and fight the creatures that have been haunting his nightmares ever since that fateful night br br truly earns its b rated rating but what was cool about it was that it didn't focus on crappy b rated cgi graphics in fact 0 of the film was cgi the monsters were actually decently put together and although the storyline was lacking it was somewhat watchable if for only one time
<START> if it were possible to award a 10 this would be the one film i would choose br br i remember catching this film on tv many many years ago and fortunately being prepared enough to video it now my video copy is getting old video technology is outdated and i'm starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer br br as a wildlife film it is superb as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since how can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten if such a thing as a lobby pressure group exists to push for the re release of this film count me in and send me the details pronto br br my guess is there's a mint to be made by anyone able to re release this in today's market
<START> jennifer novel was brought to the screen by canadian director adam brooks in a film that based on some comments from contributors to this forum sounds a bad proposition but in fact it's much better than one is led to believe br br this is a story about two sisters who loved one another dearly faith the fair headed and happy go lucky hippie girl takes her younger sibling phoebe under her wing phoebe plainly loves faith when the older one decides to follow her boyfriend wolf to europe on a summer vacation from berkley she promises she will send phoebe a post card every day faith does that until the cards stop coming in and one night some time later the family receives a phone call to inform them faith has died under tragic circumstances br br phoebe can't forget faith that is why after some years pass by she decides to take the same route the older sister took she takes the cards from faith and visits each place starting in amsterdam then moving on to paris and she wants to end up the trip in portugal where faith encountered her untimely death br br in paris phoebe hooks up with wolf who by now is not a hippie anymore and is living with his girlfriend wolf tries to persuade phoebe into abandoning her trip and to go back home she suspects that wolf holds the key into solving the mystery and as she is going to depart for portugal she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts wolf's version he has told phoebe he feels guilty and against his girlfriend's wishes decides to accompany phoebe to the town where faith died the story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what faith experienced in europe and what happened in her final days br br the best thing in the invisible circus are the performances of the principals something that mr brooks has to take the credit for the big surprise is the range of cameron diaz who as faith seems to select light comedy parts when she is quite able to do good dramatic work under the right director jordana brewster is seen as the older phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film she is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness for acting christopher eccleston is wolf and shows he also is capable of doing more serious drama the sweet camilla belle plays the younger phoebe quite convincingly blythe danner appears as the mother of the girls br br the european locations are gloriously photographed by henry the film is also enhanced by the musical score of nick laird clowes and petra original song elizabeth edited with great elegance ultimately this film shows adam brooks in great form as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast doing wonders for him
<START> if you are a pretentious person it would sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality saying that you really like this movie br br otherwise don't bother and better watch something good br br this is the stereotypical movie for snobs the plot line would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end it is just presented in a messed up way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie look intellectual br br mullholland drive is not enjoyable to watch you would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it and if you do you would most likely be disappointed because it is not a big deal
