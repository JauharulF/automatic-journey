<START> there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans its quite good and its been done and redone in film and tv many many times some are notable but this urbanized version that injects the tired old racism themes just flat out stinks leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script chaplin this guy isn't there must be people who find a dwarf who cant stop dancing funny i mean i suppose it is funny in a pathetic freakish way but its just not enough to carry a movie you have the usual nazi or neo nazi whatever the heck we are supposed to think type villain who's son of course is gay german accents get the picture
<START> before i'd seen this movie i've heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how horrific it was not to take any credit away from this movie i think it wasn't all that horrible or even shocking it's just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town and a good one at portraying the point br br there's some great acting here and a well thought of manuscript westerberg is a renowned writer in the finnish movie scene and he's the best in what comes to describing the contemporary finnish culture albeit he's not the only one writer for this movie but i dare say he's the main writer anyway correct me if i'm wrong br br the casting is excellent except for jasper the pseudo main character who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene and the sets the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie br br this movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous finnish band's very well known song maa which very roughly translated to maa throughout the whole finnish society lead to a sad dark end accompanied with booze and the bad choices and it's the side of everyday finnish life about 80 of the population have no awareness of unless movies like this are made
<START> for those of you who've wondered what an art house monster movie might be like wonder no more the daimajin trilogy circa 1966 was just such a series more period samurai epics than anything else these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most literally monstrous deux et machinas ever there's not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished from the scenario s to the performances to the filmmaker's craftsmanship even the special effects are handled with well above average skill and are integrated in most instances almost seamlessly into the movie s if you're a gojira fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre i highly recommend the daimajin trilogy
<START> there are some things you just don't do so says the tag line of this a 2003 david zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled my boss's daughter and it's the tag line which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it there are indeed some things you just don't do with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within my boss's daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture my boss's daugther is a sordid creepy grotesque experience a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression to see it is to endure it to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself Â if any of the cast writers extras hell even the guys that worked as runners on the set aid in producing anything as earth poor as this again then it'll be either because they've been sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of film or it'll be because they've most probably garnered employment on behalf of the friedberg seltzer mob br br my boss's daugther which i'm pretty sure ought to be titled my boss' daugther grammatically speaking revolves around its hapless male lead named tom kutcher and a night in at his boss' house as he chases that seemingly elusive 'goal' that is his young blonde daughter lisa taylor reid someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of jack taylor stamp tom spies lisa early on she's taking the subway to work with all the other despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company after trying to talk to her but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in tom's crotch than anything else he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after dark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her and yes she does still live with her father think hitchcock's 1960 film psycho with the gender roles between norman bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughs br br the distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts they are a ruthless and smarmy bunch whom it's made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush without ever returning them one day it happens with tom there and his wish is to return it thus pounding into us that he's not like other guys this as he first sees lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position this rather obvious and flat footed attempt to try and get us to with tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co workers in this company br br it is however as close as my boss's daughter comes to any level of film making from a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from hell tom's arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party instead he is charged with house sitting jack's pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house it's been established terrance stamp's character means business in the strictest of manners firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee it's not that jack is a shrewed businessman he's a cleanliness freak obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land you can imagine that when we're let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong there's obviously going to be trouble br br the film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes the first time someone uses the to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top you may smirk but by the time half the house is wrecked and michael madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug you've got your head in your hands each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall inbetween the gross out wackiness the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky saccharine driven romance as lisa and tom bond whilst talking of in workplace and out of workplace persona's and that maybe they have more in common than first thought by the hour mark the film's opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when there's an entire scene that exists purely to target and a dumb subplot to do with a head injury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded throughout stamp's character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them to which the common place reply ought to be whilst channeling jack taylor was reading the screenplay first too complicated a concept for you stamp
<START> i just bought this movie yesterday night and i love it everyone did great acting in it especially ryan dunn and bam the whole plot was great and as dunn said in the extras on the dvd they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again this movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies i can't stop replaying scenes over and over again just to see it again i've never done that with any other movie i would definitely recommend this to other people to watch because it is such a great movie and if you like bam it's a perfect movie for you the little montages that they show in between every scene are just great i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie they are very sad with mostly music from the band 'him ' which of course is my favorite band
<START> comanche moon had everything going for it for starters simon back a man who's name is synonymous with high quality tv westerns unfortunately the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn't solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel br br forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in moon is that it's not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece so many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in moon considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background the lack of character driven and emotional backstory is downright painful br br that said moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen for example the novel moon focuses largely on the themselves to its credit the miniseries tries to service the but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story similarly val kilmer's scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts instead kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act br br there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book a killer parrot what further there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be not a single one of their in moon or dead man's walk for that matter ends successfully and call and just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another br br frankly larry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie brokeback mountain can write good novels although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director but original screenwriter bill to adapt the novel to screen doesn't exactly have a of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at down the original lonesome dove with all this said comanche moon is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do steve portrayal of gus or rather his portrayal of robert duvall as gus is dead on and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet stoic woodrow of the original movie all i can say is blame because is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel br br still it's the cast that sparkles in moon to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well nurtured full blown network tv series br br all in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel
<START> well to start with rajkumar santoshi is not a comedy film maker and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece this film is really funny loud in bits overacted in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun story line in simple a billionaire's daughter come to india for marriage and two young chaps r behind her the story has a twist as well with a connection of a gangster aamir playing a street smart guy amar has played his role with brilliance and salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection raveena has done fine but really turns irritating in some sequences but real show stealer r paresh rawal and shakti kapoor they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no of times without getting bored
<START> despite later claims this early talkie melodrama has very little in common with citizen kane it's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional told in flashback but hopping around time the scriptwriter preston sturges shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of kane are evident still it's very watchable with a young spencer tracy his old man makeup makes him look just like well an old spencer tracy showing depth and authority and colleen moore a little past her prime and not physically well matched playing a multifaceted woman behind the man there's also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history sending the final third into ecstatic soap opera reverberations the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets and there are some plot holes left open how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them and the music is awfully hokey for all that i was quite fascinated
<START> ingmar bergman's meditation on war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast of what country isn't specified raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports as they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of armies at war where most of the casualties are the civilians have come of age this is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head what do i do now as an intellectual exercise the film is top notch this is a film that will make you think as an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving i was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip flops i should state that i admire bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table however i have never been moved by his films i am not a fan i always sided with fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films reservations aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war for most of us is just a thing on a tv screen
<START> having been interested in for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e bay and bought a copy on dvd for 99p i enjoyed the film the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character makes it more of a family saga rather than an action film the costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time 1955 the back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy my main interest was in the character of and his monotheistic religion in this film he was portrayed as being jesus like in his refusal to go to war with the even through they were invading egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of and political power initially one makes a connection between who was cast adrift in the river nile in a reed basket and the old testament moses but this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a moses like character carries monotheistic religion out to the wider world if such a film will ever be politically possible to make it is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between and merit the character played by jean simmons is hard to accept and that an educated physician would be so smitten by the babylonian femme fatal to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and tomb is not really believable neither that his parents would even have a tomb in real life was the wife of and although did become pharaoh it was after a few others including who was the son of br br but of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus maybe following the de vinci code book and film this film be re made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism i wait in great anticipation of such a film there are already numerous books on the subject
<START> i saw this movie when i was a kid and have been looking for it ever since it rates up there with cabin in the sky stormy weather and carmen jones as a must see in movies that showcased the awesome talent of african americans in the 60s the local los angeles tv stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days and bess was one of them and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the tv and only moved on the commercials south pacific oklahoma and the sound of music are all musical classics that you can pick up at any video store it would be a shame to let this collection of some of the best talent america had to offer be forgotten or locked in a vault please make the film available to the public
<START> what crack are you smoking this movie while gloriously entertaining is awful br br the action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad the colonel's daughter is painfully irritating the ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning and when joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy i just about peed myself i could go on br br entertaining arguably so good no well made certainly not br br as a commentary on america as empire it's actually pretty good joe as a typical white conqueror isn't all that surprising especially in the context of mid 1980s american cinema
<START> i've read just about every major book about the manhattan project most people know what it was but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project its scope was immeasurably massive rivaled in us history perhaps only by the space program of the 1960's br br there were literally millions of people involved from all walks of life at numerous sites most clandestine around the country each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they couldn't talk about to the person sitting in the cubicle next to them much less their family the logistics are overwhelming particularly given the considerations of wartime communication security and transportation in the 1940's br br as an example my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the manhattan project his job was to supervise a crew of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for manufacturing forms for the pouring of concrete for the massive research installations at washington that's all he did six days a week for nearly two years these carpenters needed food housing sanitary facilities hospitals and materials just as much as did oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid just think about it that being said it's simply impossible to do the subject justice in a 2 hour movie in defense of however i would say that they had an impossible task particularly since he chose to have a diverse screenplay with multiple plots multiple angles and multiple characters what exactly was he thinking and how could he be so arrogant to think that this would work that's hollywood i guess br br fat man and little boy has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all horrible casting dreadful and politically motivated writing bad science the portrayals of and are particularly inaccurate and downright galling notwithstanding the screenplay's all too obvious agenda it is still incredibly bland and sloppy br br these flaws have been listed elsewhere on imdb but i was particularly struck by the fact that the scientists had so much time on their hands softball horseback riding parties semi formal dinners ballet etc not to mention romance and of course circulating political according to fm lb if these great brains had gotten off their and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing laura dern we might have won the war before d day br br one final gripe fm lb mentions that fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs but it doesn't mention that these names were a semi good natured jab at fat man for heavy stature and oppenheimer little boy for his slight stature another reason paul newman should not have been in this movie
<START> john waters owes me 2 hours of my life back i saw a sneak preview screening of this way back in 1990 and i'm still in pain not before or since have i seen such a terrible piece of filmic waste spewed upon the screen there is nothing positive i can say about this film acting awful plot ridiculous music atrocious following the movie my friends and i demanded our money back from the manager of the theater he explained that since it was a free screening he couldn't give us anything in return no matter how much agony we were suffering through how johnny depp's career survived this trainwreck of a movie is anyone's guess
<START> first off i'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to imdb and jacking up the rating but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76 approval rating it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity i mean this film is simply awful the acting is simply terrible but the rest of the film is worse at least the acting provides some unintentional laughs br br the plot involves a teenage skateboarding boy who is being questioned along with his friends for a murder that happened by a park where they skate and that's about it the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible acting terrible dialog slow motion shots of people walking of people's faces of people skating often set to music that does not fit the scene perhaps that was done to be cool or experimental or hip or perhaps it was done in hopes that it would fool people into thinking that it is somehow profound but it does not work nothing in this film works it's pretentious garbage i can't not recommend it enough
