<START> driving lessons sees two middle class quintessential british families meet head on when character comes into contact with walters a slightly deranged out of touch actress with an ego betrays his overpowering and over christian mother linney and goes off travelling with to scotland to accompany her on a trip to participate in a poetry reading something she claims could be her last due to an illness br br portrayal of a caged youngster brainwashed by an overbearing and even hypocritical mother is the masterpiece of this film his portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals and happiness is captivating to watch unfold throughout the film is sharply shot and well paced with very few moments leaving you tired an achievement particularly considering the nature of the plot walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things emphasising linney's ironic immorality throughout her role in driving lessons is enjoyable and memorable in every sense br br the plot develops nicely leaving the audience cheering on as he chases back to place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings the values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag in a very consistent way the overbearing and relieving main idea being that religion doesn't lead to happiness and certainly doesn't lead to morality br br the audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable with her and making an irresistible partnership on the big screen transferred directly from their debut in the harry potter series charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must see this christmas

<START> this is a good time to say how good i think of this site it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours awaiting for something to happens for something to be said to be shown to be insinuated subtly for a symbol an idea whatever no just long endless violins alternated by a tired piano tired voices tired actors and bored characters and situations boring is the long death of the mind and this movie is from that point of view a public enemy how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators i don't claim for my money back just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing oh god
<START> what a bad movie tart is perhaps the very worst movie i've seen all year and i've run across some doozies there is nothing redeeming about this trash from the characterization to the direction to the plot even the usually brilliant dominique swain couldn't save this movie none of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic with the possible exception of eloise wonderfully portrayed by lacey chabert the only bright spot in this dismal failure br br possible spoilers br br the main problem with tart is that it rambles on without saying anything it staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story it also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details the hypochondriac brother the mother's possessions constantly being repossessed the anti semitic classmate the other classmate's murderous father without successfully exploring a single one of them and just when i finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end br br i left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated this is an obvious first film from a writer director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting public br br i gave this film 1 out of 10 and i'm usually very generous even with bad films
<START> this film sucks a big one so many holes in the plot if the devil is invincible why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards i couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears takes their entire armoury and disappears again nice work if you can get it it's sad that the last 1 2 hour has to result in the standard arnie finale arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film dreadfully scripted arnie is called etc for 95 of the film and then suddenly we hear him being called by his real name of jericho cane where do they get these names from the ending is so twee you'd better get the barf bag ready shame that gladiator pulled off the same ending with 100 more class br br
<START> johnny crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval billy graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet sometimes corny but all the way sincere flick he gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good solid advice that holds true today about morals decisions the generation gap teen dating some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding they sound like today's stats just to see billy in his younger days is worth seeing it's an awesome movie it made me realize that human nature does not change even though hair fashion and language may change humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years
<START> when deranged was made the film makers saw fit to turn ed gein into ezra cobb even though the resultant film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case i presume that enough was fictionalised that they thought they should change names and such br br ed gein the butcher of masquerades as a true story retelling of the gein case but actually bears very little resemblance to the history as a biopic type film it is a travesty if ever a film needed names changing it is this one far more so than deranged it is as close to the true crime story as dirty harry was to the true story of the zodiac killings br br ok so that annoyance aside how is it as a horror film well as a horror film well as a film generally it is quite appalling one of the worst films i have sat through in months issues run thus 1 kane hodder is quite astonishingly miscast as ed gein utterly unsuitable in the part hodder just lumbers through menacingly very bad br br 2 kane hodder is the best actor in the film the rest of the cast are rather amateur dramatics and utterly unengaging it is painful to witness some lines being delivered br br 3 the occasional efforts of stylish film making seem to come from the big book of moody cinematography clichÃ© you've seen it all before better executed aside from the efforts at style the rest of the film making is largely inept cameras shake framing is bad there are overlong pointless shots holding back the pace which leads me to br br 4 it seems to go on forever it is under 90 minutes in length but sitting through it is an ordeal you'd swear it ran two and a half hours br br 5 ed gein almost seems secondary mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff said deputy is played by an abysmal actor upon whose shoulders no film should rest br br is anything good about it well the gore fx are very good some convincing wounds are in display and the make up is generally excellent none of this however makes up for the massive failings of the film br br it doesn't even have any kitsch value it's just bad not enjoyably bad not so bad it's good just genuinely bad a film to avoid and despise
<START> this hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever and i certainly won't argue with that even in a country where top notch animated shorts are created with regularity this film still manages to stand out if you ever get the chance to view this film please do so it's only ten minutes long and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws a woman who vacuums the bathtub and a nuclear war what more could you want in a film
<START> there's a brand new killer on the loose and he's doing god's work yeah right this killer makes jason look like a chump and freddy krueger look like a rag doll against this dude he is jacob goodnight wwe's glen kane jacobs a monster who wields a axe and a hook and chain those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets that is totally methodical when the encounter happened 4 years earlier jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head how on earth did goodnight survive after 4 years now he's in the condemned hotel called blackwell and this hotel got a lot of stories to tell i thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting i liked the part where goodnight checked out one of the girl's tattoo on her back and goodnight himself is really deranged thanks to his maniacal mother if you think friday the 13th was something you better think again this movie will leave you on the edge of you seat and i think the eyeball rip was bone chilling this movie proves it point and it wasn't a waste of my time i enjoyed it the title don't lie rating 2 5 out of 5 stars
<START> um hello rainbow the name alone is hard to take it seriously like she could be the cousin of strawberry shortcake but when you're a kid this is definitely serious stuff br br so there's this vile snotty spoiled girl and she wants rainbow belt amongst other things ie the light of the whole universe and rainbow and her friend cris are bound and determined to stop her as i remember murky and had a minor role in this production maybe they wanted too much money br br so anyway snotty evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take belt imagine but somehow rainbow gets her belt back and re it with star sprinkles and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of cris and his prism bracelet and they also save the whole universe in the process br br so good triumphs over evil niceness triumphs over rudeness and rainbow and the color kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind
<START> i've had never been disappointed by a kurosawa film but this is probably the first doppelganger is the worst i've seen from this director br br tartan films is advertising this as the most frightening film yet from kiyoshi kurosawa what the most frightening film from kurosawa is definitely kairo and if you think this is horror your in for a surprise this can't be classified as horror or thriller this is a drama and a pretty bad one at that a lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny and a lot of the plot is really confusing and since it's kurosawa the pacing is slow but it's so slow that you'll lose interest forty minutes in and feel like doing something else the thing that annoyed me the most was the use of cgi now cgi if used well can be really cool but if executed with little care it can be a disaster i think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of cgi br br the only positive thing i can give is that it has really good acting koji yakusho gives a great performance along with the rest of the cast but that's pretty much it br br please do yourself a favor and go watch kairo or ko rei if you want to be scared this is a bad bad attempt at a smart drama which it is intelligent but well there's a lot missing br br 3 10 for the good acting
<START> just desserts was i must say one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies my expectations weren't high to begin with but it turned out to be cornier than i expected i thought it might not be all that bad when it started but as soon as the name of the competition the golden whisk came up i began changing my mind it all went downhill from there the only thing i did like about this movie other than snickering at it's absurd plot and dialogue was watching them cook however being a movie about pastry chefs there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie you get to see more food being prepared and you dodge the pathetic one liners however if you enjoy corny love stories which is sometimes fun go ahead and watch
<START> having never actually seen anything by this beloved of the let alone a production of merchant of venice i cant comment on how faithful it is to previous adaptations of the play so i will treat it as just another movie that tries to be more than novocaine for the eye is an instantly gripping movie about a young lover fiennes and his merchant friend antonio irons and a jewish money lender shylock pacino br br plot summary br br is broke and needs money to woo the lovely collins he goes to his friend antonio who with his friends predicament so borrows some money off shylock br br now antonio does not like jews in general and shylock in particular and shylock bitter and twisted from the abuse he has suffered from antonio in particular and christians in general agrees to lend antonio the money on condition that if antonio does not repay the loan by the agreed deadline shylock will cut a pound of flesh from body br br comment br br the movie is breathtakingly beautiful and acted and spoken in such a way as to force you to think about what each line means this in turn causes the viewer to gain insights into the characters and their motivations br br it seems to me to be a movie about the choices that shylock makes and how making wrong choices leads to ruin br br from the moment shylock demands his pound of flesh he is doomed for rest of the world is against him and to bring about his downfall br br this disturbed me greatly normally in a movie when a victim gets a chance of revenge against those who have harmed him either the victim succeeds or makes the villain see the error of his ways leading to a big hug br br not in the victim quickly becomes seen as the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith br br this movie is a powerful and subtle portrayal of casual anti semitism which shows how a whole society can turn on a minority and make it seem like the victim is really the offender br br i was blown away by this movie 10 10
<START> the acting was flat at least none of the actors sounded like they'd just got the script that morning and the film and sound quality made me think of the 70s movie of the week bombs the only thing that told me that it was indeed not a 70s movie of the week was the reference to dna testing but for me being eastern orthodox the most egregious thing about this film was the total of the religion romania is 88 orthodox but you'd never know that from this movie father soren is irish and i'd have known this even if i hadn't seen the actor play the irish pub keep michael sullivan in star trek voyager's episodes the bishop was wearing roman and for the record not even orthodox bishops wear their unless they're saying the especially if they live in a monastery about the only non paraphernalia i saw was the 3 bar cross on the door of the church and even then i had to squint to see it the first reviewer said the producers had done their research well if that's true they messed up on the religious aspect of the film
<START> i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film
