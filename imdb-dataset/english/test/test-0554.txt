<START> great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag one feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion closure or at least an ironic twist br br it had that familiar curb feel without dare i say it larry as the annoying polar opposite the music was there the about nothing' scenes pop up but without any common thread or suspense it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget br br spoilers the movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding he prefers just any junk food regardless of the sell by date maybe i want someone to eat dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together br br marty this is just not funny and overdone people just don't care about a 'show' within a show a coffee book table about coffee books was funnier br br unless you are big fans of the cast save your time and eat some cheese it doesn't even have to be with anyone
<START> congo is probably the worst big budget movie of the 1990s it is so bad that it is watchable over and over again a bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest africa where they encounter a temple of riches just like in king solomon's mines but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches on their side the humans have a talking gorilla named amy who helps save the day at one point or another so much for the plot the dialogue throughout is witless the acting almost uniformly atrocious certainly campy tim curry and ernie hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor and the special effects abysmal wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas and the lava oh yes did i mention there's a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale laura linney of all people is along for this of rides what could she have been thinking this is right around the same time she appeared with richard gere and ed norton in primal fear a movie that helped guarantee her stardom
<START> i liked this film a lot the actors were great particularly potente who is different in every role fÃ¼rmann who is also able to play anyone and loos who spices things up she is also a talented singer she sings the song my truth heard when one character cranks up the stereo in the lab br br anatomie is a good horror flick which pays attention to its characters it is also very gory at times and the set design is innovative it is too bad they had to make a sequel which is nowhere near the original br br on a side note two other things definitely worth mentioning the dvd is not dubbed which makes for a better experience of the film also make sure to keep watching after the final credits start rolling
<START> i won't lie i rented this film because it was an arty film with some possible explicit sex i got that scene and catherine deneuve's briefly shown breasts but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like did i have a mother or father i don't know paraphrased usually delivered in long soliloquies br br if you are curious about the transition of art to porn might be an interesting look with use of the fast forward button i was still too slow
<START> as americans we have come to expect as par for the course when it comes to horror and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers we truly expect this to suck when they don't suck it becomes an over night success br br this is not an over night success nor is it an over the weekend or over the month success this blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this go into this knowing it sucks enjoy it for what it is for what it isn't if you have something better to do keep this on the back way back burner it's entertaining in the way watching the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour but don't expect much they almost never get hit by an actual car its just a lot of hoopla
<START> documentaries about fans are always mishmashes and never worth seeing through but i found this one made by some of the fans themselves more than usually unenlightening as a veteran of the original tolkien craze forty years ago i'd hoped for more than the obvious which doesn't always equate to the true if there's anyone living who doesn't already know the nature of a fandom any fandom from having been or known a fan he won't discover it here between platitudes to which the actors from the films are particularly prone and acting out by fans making the most if not the best of their one shot at fame i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr the special emotional responses it evokes and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take in addition the film is rather lazy it some facts that could have been got across with little effort e g what the exact legal loophole was the wording of a copyright notice that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the u s speaking of which i take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as irrelevant and psychedelic which they were not they were the work of jack a very able sf illustrator of the period and some fans including me found them more apt and more attractive than the covers on the rival set
<START> silent historical drama based on the story of anne boleyn newly arrived lady in waiting to the queen who catches the lustful eye of henry viii bad tempered king of england who loves to feast drink hunt be entertained by his court jester watch and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle well he's soon annulled his marriage married anne and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady in waiting meanwhile anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant perturbed or downright ready to burst into tears she just doesn't come across as a happy camper or is it just bad acting br br this film is a solid piece of entertainment with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print emil jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well done portrayal of king henry the eighth he really seemed like he was henry the eighth i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne seemed a bit over the top the dvd of this film features an appropriate nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story quite a good film
<START> five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping were they run into their childhood nemeses as well as escaped convicts in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy most of the cast are content to simply phone it in and don't really seem to care about the film in the least the writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are for the most part the name of the actors that respectively play them richard lewis's shtick gets really old really quick even the late great character actor brion james can't save this stinker even though he's one of the few actors in the film that doesn't totally embarrass himself i hardly cracked a smile much less had anything that would reasonably be even misconstrued as a laugh awful br br my grade f
<START> airplane apart i don't think i've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life br br i love football like mad but i tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic this wasn't br br i watched it once it was over 2 years ago it was brilliant everyone i know loved it i remember the gay the pitch at about a 45 degree angle and a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes brilliant that's what goes on in park football br br a definite 10 10 if anyone from the tv industry is reading this considering all the crap you repeat on english tele please have the sense to show this again and the muppets while you're at it also does anyone know if this was shown on bbc or itv i think it was itv so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again they should do
<START> watching stranger than fiction director marc forster's the kite runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this art house epic rated pg 13 is good for your movie going diet no this isn't the kind of movie that i like to slouch on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day the kite runner isn't your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your troubles first no celebrity stars appear in it second nothing is cut and dried black or white or so outlandish that you don't believe an image that you see third the kite runner lapses into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native tongue fourth forster's film isn't a romantic trifle about boy wants girl boy loses girl and then boy wins girl back fifth this foreign language film may make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life friendship and survival the chief themes here are cowardice and redemption the protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must atone for at the cost of his own personal safety and integrity right the kite runner is about redeeming oneself for the sins of the past we're talking about personal accountability so don't rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy's night out celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system based on bestselling novel this culturally enlightened melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those light hearted friendship movies about adolescents in the vein of the adventures of tom sawyer and the about a half hour into its 127 minutes this escapade about two youngsters who fly kites in afghanistan turns dark and unsavory nevertheless if you can handle the remaining hour of the plot you'll emerge gratified relieved and perhaps even entertained br br the kite runner opens in san francisco in the year 2000 as our protagonist afghan Ã©migrÃ© amir jan of united 93 and his wife leoni of the florist receive two boxes of published copies of first novel no sooner has amir had a chance to in his triumph of a life time as a storyteller than the phone jars him from his reverie and he is drawn reluctantly back into a past that is best left forgotten for him khan shaun of the nativity story calls amir from pakistan to make a request was a servant in household back in the 1970s when amir lived with his wealthy merchant father baba of a taste of cherry in afghanistan before the soviet invasion you have one more chance to be good informs amir without sugar coating his request basically wants amir to fly to pakistan and then enter war torn afghanistan and rescue young grandson ali danish ari who is being held a prisoner against his will as a sex slave for newcomer abdul a cruel taliban chieftain and once dreaded adversary br br the kite runner shifts from san francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback set in kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic twelve year old amir and the son of his father's servant hassan ahmad khan love to watch movies such as john sturges' western the magnificent seven when they aren't flying kites incidentally this is kite flying like you've never seen kite flying not only do the kids fly them but they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another kid's kite the kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in tony scott's top gun hassan is best friend but unlike amir hassan belongs to the reviled minority earlier young amir and hassan had a confrontation with young and his two was about to beat them up but hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatened to use it on had no choice but to back down meanwhile amir was prepared to suffer the hand fate had dealt him father baba laments his son's lack of spine and fears that he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward unlike the plucky little hassan who bails amir out of predicaments anyway amir and hassan emerge from the showdown with without a scratch later after amir sets a new record with his kite flying and fight skills hassan runs after a kite to claim it hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title hassan claims the fallen kite but he finds himself at the mercy of and his two minions lets hassan kept the kite but his minions pin hassan spread eagle belly down in an alley while sodomizes the youth worst a traumatized amir watches the assault from nearby but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him br br aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with the kites the kite runner is down to earth straight forward stuff when amir returns to afghanistan to rescue he masquerades as a taliban fighter but he doesn't carry a firearm the rescue scene in the kite runner is rather like the escape scene from the midnight express while forster doesn't explore the local politics or plunge us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here indeed troy scenarist david had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices aren't clearly delineated so you have to accept some things on faith forster lensed the film in nearly china to give it an authentic look forster deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating the performances especially by the children stand out for their believability the kite runner is a film that you won't easily forget
<START> i saw this film with a live performance by the buffalo philharmonic and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me particularly the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating the other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself a bit of strategy ripped off thoroughly by the makers of king arthur in 2004 also the battle goes on forever half an hour painfully long i can't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding i'm surprised stalin liked this film so well i wouldn't want to go out and fight after watching it
<START> produced by international playhouse pictures it looks as if filmed in a doll house everybody's a liar everything is dream like toy like for no good reason i'm not saying everything in all movies should be totally realistic but such unbelievable fantasy things and situations in one movie are way too much how did they get these fine actors actresses particularly to this movie it's nice to see mia again if we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her mia does do it well not funny not moving just fake stephen dorff briefly appears at the end fitting for a play maybe less for a movie but this isn't one to measure things at terrible
<START> i loved this it starts out as a fairly normal slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden halfway through it's turned on it's head this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one sadly the ending doesn't make much sense which is a great shame oh yes and it's brilliantly filmed
<START> blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action i cant wait for blade 2 this is one of wesley snipes greatest movies the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great
<START> it's a time machine all right it runs in real time for 96 minutes but it felt like 96 years the first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous massive amounts of dead time throughout what happened when will something happen who cares apparently the film was made on a tight budget i note for your edification the following the nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes from lord of the rings part i hey the scary dude in charge of controlling the the scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of gene simmons of the band kiss old costumes little known fact freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails br br save your money save your time pass on this one
