<START> to keep it as simple as possible this is a very good show that is well written and has a fantastic cast it's not loaded with blood and guts and centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex wife his son his former partner andre braugher his childhood friend now a priest george and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode are you likely to find something like this going on in your city no is this still a good story yes and it's nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws watch more then one 2 3 and you'll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show and thank you david morse for making this character so interesting another good job
<START> death wish 3 brings back charles bronson as one time vigilante paul now retired yeah right before long is back to his old ways but this time its not just a few muggers at a time its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city new york again by the way this time its war so out the big guns literally for this the body count int his one rivals anything stallone or schwarzenegger have come up with this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die or get severely injured in creative ways which is always a good thing the violence is not as personal in this one its obviously on a much grander scale sort of like bombing your victims from afar rather than one on one combat this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2 making it easier to watch there's not much import to this film its more escapism than anything its also cheesy at times and pseudo inspirational but hose scenes fall flat they should have left the original death wish on its own without sequels but since they didn't they should have stopped here 8 10
<START> though this is a good enjoyable cartoon they did much better ones later on like this is almost like the first star trek feature which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what just for existing this is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches but nothing special reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits recommended
<START> i once heard this movie described as either you'll love it or you'll hate it from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings i would venture to say that this is true i am placing myself in the hate it crowd i have seen some truly bad movies boring movies and even low budget movies this movie is bad on all three fronts br br this island earth's exeter jeff morrow returns to his sci fi b movie roots as dr les minus giant head prosthetic the doctor and his assistant arnie george o'hanlon aka the voice of george jetson along with girlfriend assistant vera are tracking a meteor this is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date les has vera and arnie has his susie synchro unifying integrating aka the computer lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid rosie and his relationship with susie is more believable than the cold clam like feelings vera has for les and vice versa the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor however it is really an alien art art deco energy storage device which moves around like a 3 legged dog there is also the little alien energy being that controls dr aka the chief scientist there the alien is obviously and from the get go malicious and evil is this the kind of science we are handing out no wonder the aliens from the explorers were afraid of us from watching some of these movies we shoot first there's no need for questions afterwards br br the whole movie is synonymous with watching some really boring science experiments like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery its not the fact that this is a low budget sci fi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated it is really really really boring the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on that is it most of the things we learn about what's going on are through monologues and self now add crappy dialog cardboard acting and cheap sets and you have the makings of an ed wood clone by the way ed has made some really boring movies as well please avoid the orgy of the dead the dialog oh the dialog such as br br from under 2 miles of ocean br br why not it came through a billion miles in space br br or br br do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who's probably pulled the scientific boner of all time br br this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet this island earth magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits twilight zone namely a low budget sci fi movie or tv episode that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations at the core these movies are enjoyable on some level the story the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations this movie has none of that it is just 90 minutes of boredom i couldn't even enjoy this on a ed wood level i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead it is so bad that if my name was dr forrester i would never think of showing this movie to anyone except frank maybe
<START> this is an excellent movie and i would recommend it to everyone mr acting is top notch as it always is and he blends well with the other actors in the movie can't give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie hell to pay is a must see movie the plot was very suspenseful i would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie it was very authentic in how they displayed the components dealing with this movie which includes the guns horses and clothing the soundtrack is enjoyable and adds flavor to the movie james drury has the right touch when picking out a movie to be involved with this is a another winner for the western genre
<START> don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds mon oncle antoine because like the best of canadian films darkness lurks just below the surface br br set presumably in 1940s rural quebec the story explores the developing consciousness of young benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death br br the look of the film is astonishing especially seeing as a high proportion of criticism towards canadian cinema by the general public surrounds aesthetics beyond this the unassuming benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience looking at his corrupting community with fresh an innocent eyes br br i recommend reading jim critical essay on the film in canada's best features for anyone looking to place the film into a historical context while also dissecting the form of the film definitely check this one out
<START> this is another of john travolta's come back movies and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one his come back will take hold br br this is so sweet sickeningly so if you're not into the romance comedy scene if you are this is one innovative romcom every performance including that of skippy the dog was beautiful without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in dogma although as movies go i loved dogma br br travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe he is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read then you understand that angels were far from perfect you will not therefore be insulted by this film even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work as nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible given the subject matter br br i love this and love it more each time i watch it it's beautiful and sweet engaging and endearing br br it rates a 7 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> number 1 was really great summer popcorn fun it was the modern jaws br br number 2 is best summed up by jeff goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas or something like that br br number 3 is the obituary notice jp has achieved all it ever will br br once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie br br that said movie is ok if you don't mind knowing you already have seen it before br br
<START> oddly i have very little to say about the box so this will be pretty brief i have never read the richard matheson novella button button from which the film is based but considering what i saw in this adaptation there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work the box is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it frank langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button the only is that it will automatically kill someone somewhere spoiler they push it end of spoilers that whole concept was interesting on its own but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted stargate knock off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message while i'm trying to be as as possible i still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely i guess its from the same director as donnie darko which i remember liking when i saw it years ago the box would've worked well as a short film but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way i can't come close to recommending it
<START> the mummy's curse is the last in the series of the kharis mummy films and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one kharis and his mate ananka both end up in the of louisiana and on his resurrection he searches out his beloved princess how they end up in louisiana isn't made entirely clear but with various people trying to find them the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders br br the mummy's curse was watchable but it really wasn't anything special i had the feeling throughout the movie that i'd seen this before quite frankly apart from the original the mummy with boris karloff the mummy movies are not my favorites among the old universal horrors they're not bad but they do get a bit repetitive br br there are some great scenes in the movie the scene with ananka coming to life in the swamp for instance but overall this didn't do much for me br br it's worth seeing if you want to be completest and see all of the mummy movies but otherwise you might want to pass on this one
<START> wow i just loved watching all these hot babes the scenery around malibu and california was off the fizzy i could watch it again just to see all that flesh crammed into those tiny teeny bikinis i recently saw pilar the steaming hot housekeeper in malibu spring break as a center fold in my favorite mag playboy she is hot hot hot the opening seen was bitchin when the two main girls run out of gas and stop at this desert gas station they drive the gas guy nuts with their bodies and skimpy outfits the slow mo lets me enjoy every inch of them my girlfriend liked looking at this shredded hot dude too now i'd like a bod like that and at all the other hot dudes and some of the girls too any movie that can bring that out in my girlfriend is a 10 for me
<START> jerk mike david zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away and his college cronies leave diabetic sam caleb hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story they get at sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at mike that lands across his girlfriend patty kristina sheldon instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment somehow sam's soul emerges with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot mike and the gang send the uninitiated dorks back to bring sam down but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their throats mike and his posse head for the beach to gulp booze play volleyball bicker until the scarecrow arrives to end their little sam's substitute brother jack matthew is supposed to look out for him but decides to sleep with new love interest beth samantha aisling instead so when he receives a cell phone message from mike concerning how they left sam hanging on the cross while they were off at the beach taking in the sun and sand jack is frenzied with fear beth's estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to see after sam's condition after they cut the nearly dead young man down taking him to emergency hospital returning to the beach to confront mike because of his negligence not to mention jack's promise to coach ramsey played by fighter ken shamrock regarding no hazing jack and beth will face the same straw stuffed assassin that is bumping off the others coach ramsey who was part of a past hazing incident that went awry causing killer scarecrow mischief has to confront some demons himself as he informs the survivors of the group about what they are up against br br babes boobs and blood this flick follows the basic slasher guidelines yet this flick also carries the typical slasher traits of corny characters acting dialogue and overall plot the flick shows signs of it's low budget particularly in the violence as most of the real action takes place off screen instead of showing it happening up close personal what appears on screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer's vengeance one fellow holding his guts another with a stake holding up the group's volleyball net plunged through his chest blood spatter after a woman gets hit over the head presumably with a large rock one chick laying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the suv etc there is also some dubbing problems where it's clear the sounds of their voices often don't match the movements of their lips particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where ed travis parker wannabe rock star is singing to his buddies a horrible song they all seem quite impressed with
<START> i went into this film expecting hoping for a sleazy drive in style slice of seventies exploitation but what i got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action it's clear that this film was made on a budget the locations are drab and poorly shot while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also the plot focuses on a trio of robbers a father and two sons that steal a load of gold after killing some miners they come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl currently residing in an asylum it's clear that directors louis and william sachs thought they were making something really shocking but despite its best efforts south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer the film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long winded dialogue the only good thing i have to say about the film is with regards to the music which is good in places the ending is the only other good thing about the movie and that's only because it's the last thing that happens i wouldn't recommend anyone bothers tracking this down there was much better trash made in the seventies
<START> he's not your conventional cab driver br br this guys got issues with his wife with his son a priest all his fares his ex partner and most of all himself and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past br br the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so i think this is a great show and i hope people catch on before the season's over br br watch this show
<START> this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie but i really find emil chow's character really great gutsy but determined to righting wrongs plus the main terrorist it gets me wondering his revolution makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad br br a movie that tells us about todd an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family gives him a the choice of redemption br br purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set up by stephen tung wai which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards 9 10
