<START> enigma is a computer part which scrambles russian messages so that america can't understand them they can only be read by the intended recipient the americans know that the russians are going to transmit a message revealing the plans of five political assassinations they want to carry out br br so they send in former martin sheen to grab the and substitute a false part so they'll be able to decode the message and block the assassination attempts br br however as we listen in on the americans heads of the spy organisation we find that they already have the and they want to try to steal enigma only to convince the russians that they don't already have it they don't expect to succeed that way the russians who had stopped transmitting with enigma just in case will begin transmitting again br br enigma is in the computer in the office of dimitri somehow must gain access and in order to do that he must find out when will be out he sends in his former girlfriend karen brigitte fossey to seduce so that she can look through his papers and find out his scheduled movements karen is glad to do it as they tortured her father a university professor to death br br because we know that it's better for the americans if fails the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller we find ourselves hoping he can survive against the odds especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the russians at every turn br br but what's this are karen and falling in love will win karen back or will she actually end up with the romantic twist lifts this spy thriller already worthy of a ten even higher for its originality the writing the direction and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating twist a compellingly realistic one br br you find yourself at the edge of your seat gripping your armchair not only for the excitement of the spy story but for the intensely beautiful romantic love story as well the two themes are interwoven perfectly right up to the end you really want both sides to win so who does win in the end you'll have to see the movie and find out won't you
<START> if you liked the grinch movie go watch that again because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation mike myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times his voice accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater not even the kids liked this one folks and kids laugh at anything now save your money and go see looney tunes back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie
<START> this is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors try to shove too much drama into a movie that's not dramatic at all like in the beginning the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand then shot that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later no sense whatsoever br br the only thing worse than the plot line is the cgi which would be greatly rivaled by a homemade flash movie the actors look like they're doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70's robots the dialogue makes so little sense it's not funny br br many things just happen with no explanation as to how or why such as a lady suddenly wandering around a zoo that had shut down hours ago and when she sees this thing flying towards her her first reaction is to take a picture rather than what she does a full ten minutes later power walking not even running like her life depended on it which obviously it doesn't br br overall not recommended makes me wish they still did new episodes of mst3k
<START> hoods doesn't deliver the goods this half baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast including joe mantegna kevin pollack joe pantoliano jennifer tilly and seymour cassel along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one writer director mark malone best known for writing dead of winter for bonnie clyde director arthur penn has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss louie seymour cassel dispatching his son angelo joe mantegna of house of games to whack carmine it seems that a rival mob fire bombed one of pop's warehouses in the opening scene and wants payback trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who carmine is in any other mob comedy such a complication might be amusing but here is just plain flat angelo and a carload of including his best pal rudy kevin pollack of spend half of the time trying to find out who carmine is neither rudy nor angelo want to perform the hit so they track down a crazy mob hit man charlie joe pantoliano of bad boys to do the dirty deed before they can convince charlie to make the hit they have to locate him and charlie's slutty wife mary jennifer tilly of bound reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break charlie out about half of the movie is over before they discover that carmine is a kid in short pants vincent berry who is bland and harmless indeed carmine has the only decent line in the movie as our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot instead he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor meanwhile after charlie decides not to shoot carmine the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds angelo and he struggle over the automatic the pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground goes off and blows a hole in chest now keep in mind that rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place and angelo and he argued over the wrong headedness of the hit so rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound while angelo struggles to stop the bleeding talk about a dull death scene angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't execute orders there is a flashback subplot about angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into angelo's reluctance to pack a gun br br there is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending things gets worse and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense you'll see what i mean the comedy is largely laugh less good actors wallow in sketchy roles that aren't even funny perhaps director malone was trying to do another comedy like the gang that couldn't shoot straight if he was he missed by a mile big breasted jennifer tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with mantegna but she doesn't do much of anything else she's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked a paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish initially i had hoped that this might be a ransom of red chief knockoff where the kid drives the nuts but no such luck here of course the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution br br i actually bought this movie on a canadian dvd it contains only the most basic special features if you hate previews that give away the plot don't watch the trailer if you ever meet joe mantegna one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner it is neither hilarious nor dramatic there are no quotable lines and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic the seville dvd presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning
<START> in the dvd era you would think you could find pretty much any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part it's true so why why is it so hard to find this great little flick clearly done by people who love noir as a loving homage never descending into spoof land of that most cinematic of genres emma thompson and alan rickman are a hoot in this and superstar in the making carla karen sin city does her now trademark red hot babe great acting routine br br this movie really has it all for fans of film a b noir on steroids the clever and steamy judas kiss succeeds on every count br br please columbia tristar please release it on dvd soon
<START> this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates a big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round lake i for one would not mind living there br br all in all a great film to watch over and over again
<START> there is the thrill of low budget film noir and there is the frustration of meandering uninteresting movies made on the cheap this one falls into the second category br br the spot is the name of a nightclub the film is about a policeman whose father has been killed by gangsters he heads out to track them down br br maybe it was the bad print maybe it's me but i felt i'd seen this a hundred times most of those times better than it is here br br it has promise too the cop is fascinated with a woman who plays records she introduces over juke boxes they then meet now though this was made well before i was born i have seen that kind of juke box and it is incredibly fascinating when i was a teenager i wandered into a bar that still had such a device i always liked juke boxes in bars or diners but this one was different you talked to it and a sultry sounding female voice talked back to you that is addressed here but dropped into the general uninteresting stew br br the movie has one thing going for it in a small role it features the very young anne jeffreys what a beauty she was and doubtless still is
<START> this film certainly wasn't very sophisticated no the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that i think about it but also while i think of it i did laugh proving decent comedy doesn't need to be very deep br br fatty arbuckle is the definite star of this short despite buster keaton's appearing in the film as well he is the butcher in an old time grocery store a lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and i think i laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequence you'll just have to see it yourself br br anyway later fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because he can't stand to part he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school arbuckle is one ugly woman so for silly and unsophisticated fun see this film it won't change your life and is a very slight picture but it's also fun
<START> the title tells it all ed gein the butcher of br br it's not a action filled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks that would fit it into a well established genre the kind that some people find entertaining something along the lines of halloween or the texas chain saw massacre br br this is dark slow filled with chopped up corpses and quietly evil there are few shock cuts no monster's point of view shots no loud electronic score i don't know who it's aimed at ghouls maybe br br beneath the credits we already see still photos of skulls carcasses hung up skins draped across the backs of chairs that sort of thing and they're sufficiently revolting that i couldn't help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this grand guignol opening br br alas it's not the acting is uniformly terrible as in a high school play the script does its best to sink below vulgarity ed gein who killed only two middle aged women and maybe his brother chases a screaming bloody young woman through the woodland of weir and she's wearing only a modern bra and bikini rather than period underwear gein also decapitates a night watchman which he never did in any historical sense br br the direction you could do a better job in the first few minutes law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield there is no body the handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim who may still be in the vicinity and living the sheriff lacking any motivation shouts at him now you just forget that i don't want you going off half cocked on anything it should be no more than a business like exchange of views why does the director have the sheriff so angry characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs louis armstrong's ain't misbehaving for instance this is what rural wisconsin in the 1950s and the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the cotton club in harlem in the 30s or new york intellectuals like woody allen nope the radio would be playing kitty wheel of fortune or theresa brewer or equally likely not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs that's all br br of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget but it can be light years ahead of this butchery see ed gein with steven railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies and on a budget that couldn't have exceeded this one by much br br these comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie that's about as far as i could get if anyone finds this tale to be well executed and fascinating in any way he should try to find some insight into his tastes it's beneath mine and i consider myself pretty warped
<START> like margot in fear of fear falls victim of her ambitious husband like fox in fox and his friends is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away like in the wife who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him like hermann hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company so also hans is a victim of the german society after world war ii in r w fassbinder's the merchant of the four seasons simply from the fact that fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero and homosexual couples it should be clear that he does not any sex br br in hans case there are the women who drive him into despair illness and finally death when he comes back from the foreign legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed then hans gets a job as a policeman but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute after having lost his job he works as a fruit merchant with little income going from backyard to backyard crying out his produce his mother one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a street worker in their family the love of his life she has no name in the movie refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin so he marries whom he does not love and who does not love him from her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking one evening after his wife was stalking him he explodes and hits her she flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for when is calling a lawyer for divorce hans suffers a heart attack decides to stay with him but from now on he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol so he starts to feel more and more superfluous gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive when he finds out that cheats him he chooses to end his life but not like hermann hermann by having a trip into the light of madness but he drinks himself to death in front of their little daughter and his boozing buddies fassbinder said in an interview that hans knew what he was doing the question however is did hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment or did he make self justice
<START> hellraiser bloodline is only a so so film i believe it's the fourth installment in the hellraiser series br br i missed the beginning and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box shape thing on a computer screen but using my wit and intelligence and the info button i soon found out that the villain pinhead was released from pandora's box which i believe is a gateway straight to hell br br so anyways pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the family and that's about it oh and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path yawn br br what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid and then unleashes the dog on his wife and then kills a random person then he husband comes along blah blah blah who cares why it fails is because hellraiser bloodline is too corny to be scary look at minion of creatures a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out two men whose heads and bodies are connected together siamese twins in a horror film and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort i haven't seen the previous films now look at the main villain his name is pinhead isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers and he has blue skin i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name and a corny speech somewhere in the film two cops approach him and say don't make us put some pain on you pinhead replies pain how dare you use that word i am blah blah blah blah blah it sounds a bit clichÃ© if you ask me br br don't forget the final half of the movie the characters and audience get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum some person who we don't recognize maybe he was in the previous films i don't remember him in the beginning of the movie this scene is basically one thing played over and over again br br a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise br br some other guard oh no he's down i will go check on myself br br after he dies the same thing happens again br br spoilers here's the thing i didn't get in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end so how does he come back for another four films are they prequels why hasn't he died in the previous ones geez the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series end of spoilers hellraiser bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes but has little thrill or scare value just forget it bad special effects with else make this more of a snooze fest than a good horror br br good people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning plus voice is pretty cool i suppose if you like ultra violence you might like this too br br bad none of the reasons above make this a very good film the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad and who names their villain pinhead br br feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment
<START> this film released in 1951 has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the valiant is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they don't accept that charge br br gregory peck embodies the tight lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort they in turn have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn't taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the hostiles and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond gig young neville brand lon chaney jr and warner anderson br br a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre
<START> well i don't know much about anything but i sure liked this film in short it was creative humorous simple and heartwarming in other words it was everything it set out to be br br the story is set around a girl's first love as the title suggests and i certainly should warn you expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here i mean it is a children's cartoon it's really just a simple story but it's told well and it holds your attention well br br in the end it's short it's funny it's cute it's simple it's good
<START> i am a fan of jess franco's bizarre style and a lover even of his films and my personal opinion is that he has besides several very entertaining movies also created a few masterpieces such as the brilliant aka venus in furs of 1969 for example it is however an undeniable fact that the 180 movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career also include a bunch of big time stinkers sadomania of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity br br sure the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time the only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is generously spoken slightly amusing br br after couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns wardens of a local prison camp while the husband is banished from the island the wife is taken to the prison camp a place of torture and sexual humiliation reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac magda and an extremely perverted governor the prisoners are of course entirely hot chicks most of them blondes the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles br br the plot if one can call it that is extremely stupid of course but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway the only interesting thing about sadomania is the high level of exploitation even for a 'women in prison' film there are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality and some of the torture scenes are really nasty br br it is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze however can still be so boring the sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning but after the first 45 minutes i actually had a hard time not to fall asleep it also makes me wonder why out of all pornstars jess franco chose wilson who was according to most sources a transsexual who had been born a man well maybe for exactly that reason if you really want to watch this make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor don't expect to be highly entertained however it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring i am a jess franco fan and i always will be but sadomania is just bad 2 10
