<START> this movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being feel good and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it i can't imagine how the inner circle of norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star packed premiere its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the norwegian media scene is had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves br br the combination of literally amateur actors home made style visual effects awkward dialogue painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality stay away
<START> the worst movie i've ever seen i still don't understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in maybe they had bills to pay the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife that's the beginning of a typical serial killer life it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80's but then appears a new amazing this movie was directed in 2001 i'm quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie i heard that dennis hopper's wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat pathetic
<START> murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn't considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower br br bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues don't they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan gosling br br the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually he'd be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run br br murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn't redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there's nothing to see here people move along keep moving
<START> i'm not a huge fan of lucio fulci's films most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as second rate dario argento imitations with the exception of the entertaining zombi which was a george romero imitation i didn't really enjoy them i know italian horror often disregards the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards this is why don't torture a duckling surprised me its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously rivaled by dario argento's entries into the genre and unlike fulci's previous giallo a lizard in a woman's skin this never drags br br fulci's direction here is quite good he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer's interest throughout also the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story the acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema both thomas and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout the only weak link is florinda bolkan whose performance is just far too over the top its the only laughable aspect of the film don't torture a duckling definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole 8 10
<START> if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made this movie would be on a short list along with streetcar named desire i imagine i'll discover some others that qualify but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism so its a very satisfying experience on that level just watching the marvelous probing performances of dustin hoffman meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular one of the best child performances ever br br but i also find it very satisfying to watch because its such a thoroughly involving story it always makes me forget my own problems it has such excellent narrative drive once you stick kramer vs kramer on and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them and even once you know how things do turn out each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again br br make no mistake kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved br br 10 10 br br for one of the best scripts born out of conversations between benton and hoffman who was going through a divorce at the time ever written executed and performed beautifully and not to mention what a great involving story it is put simply a perfect film
<START> there is only way to describe this movie br br so bad its hilarious br br the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout the male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure i know this sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can't help but agree br br the monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old sinbad movies br br in short this movie is good for only one thing a really large laugh at how bad movies can get br br if you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrong br br this is the movie for you
<START> i am a film directors nightmare especially of the mega buck multiplex variety while not a student of the art i still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film maker's vision if i can find it that's why a gem such as 'you are alone' is such an exhilarating find the intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go jessica and richard brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people br br spoiler below br br i bought the dvd version and have shared it with several people the reactions have been varied from disbelief in the ability of daphne to complete the assignment for which buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating as a compulsively skeptical moviegoer i have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or up to and seduced by the filmmaker this film took the later route for me and by the end i was so involved that i felt daphne's horror and pain at her role in buddy's demise my reaction to this film reminded me of watching 'the cook the thief his wife and her by peter greenaway many many years ago by the end i was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too i've watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated i am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies and 'attack of the killer bimbos' and a mixed bag 'the which i recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesn't really represent the directors vision too bad because i loved the prior two films and even found 'the interesting but wish 'the was available in a director's cut with all of the original vision and music in tact i look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads jessica and richard brundage
<START> roy thinnes and joan hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama the lush settings the haunting music and plot twists make it a truly interesting film i had seen it when it first came out on tv once more it aired when i had a vcr but i did not have a chance to tape it would love it on vhs if someone has a copy apart from the suspense which is worked in beautifully i feel the story is unique and is pretty much true to the book mrs affair by margaret lynn i would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970's out of movies made for tv i have given the film a number 10 rating because it is done with so much originality there is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit
<START> this is one of those movies that has everything in it i don't think i would get tired of seeing it hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future the casting was perfect in all respects in a sense the song sung by engelbert humperdink i never got to say goodbye is the song come to life you will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure i'm just surprised that i had never seen it before this past weekend i think that it's positively worth seeing and your heart will be glowing it would be nice to cuddle up with your honey sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other there is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn you will know exactly how the character feels true family expression is available all the way through in fact at times you'll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours see it
<START> monkey is surely one of the best shows to have ever been shown on tv i remember when i was a kid i'd go to my grandma's house every saturday morning and i'd turn on the tv so i could watch monkey i loved it it had kickass action scenes cool special effects a great story a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing but it is kind of weird that it's set in china and the actors are japanese and filmed in japan but that is no stop towards making this tv show lovable br br monkey is about the adventures of three people toshiyuki sandy and of course the unforgettable and most lovable character monkey who travel from china to india to get a bunch of holy scrolls in order to save the world br br monkey is great fun and it's magic
<START> this has got to be the most god awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched it makes mel brooks movies oscar worthy by comparison jim needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment br br while some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as the texas chainsaw massacre or night of the living dead the production value is not in question it is ability to cast and present a plausible story line the casting is deplorable for the role of charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair never mind that this actor's hair came halfway down his back manson's never went much past his shoulders this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that steve railsback or even jeremy davies lent to their portrayals of manson the actor chosen to play tex watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the manson case knows he looks like a minnesota farmer on little house on the prairie the actress playing susan atkins has a butt wider than oprah's while those familiar with the family members know that was considered somewhat retarded the actor portraying him did so in such a campy chaplinesque way it was like watching an old act instead of sharon tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman the actress looked like bloated alcoholic trailer trash speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn't proved remotely useful since the munsters the end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren't sure who they are sometimes br br facts are destroyed in this movie as well did not die in real life steven parent was shot four times not twice did not have her throat slit where were mary and bruce davis during the murder patricia never sported a dorothy hamill hair style br br the most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day freaks had to do with this movie why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached what was their problem with the journalist what was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation why were they included period the viewer never knows br br holy mackerel i could go on and on but space prevents it don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say what the f
<START> know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples 1 in the movie paul really meets before he dies in the book poirot only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if plan would have succeeded poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been poirot was in the morgue when mrs identified the victim 2 the movie has combined two persons into one cinderella has been removed by the movie the girl hastings falls in love with and the ex girlfriend of jack are one person in the movie why for god's sake 3 hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid 4 the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you shouldn't know 5 the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn't exists in the book perhaps because the person cinderella who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie 6 the book is very complex the movie takes only about 90 minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning e g bicycle race
<START> thank goodness for the coen brothers their success has brought them bigger budgets but hasn't rid them of their creativity i had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so i went to this one instead by the time it began i had forgotten what movie i was there to see i was surprised in more ways than one this movie is hilarious but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs the writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by george clooney after this nobody can say he's just a pretty face and the rest of the cast it can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the odyssey or not i can't remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever i've seen others i would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe oh brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end you can feel that their journey is building up to something but you can't tell what and the coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing it's surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out
<START> this is the very la nouvelle vague one of the best films of the new wave and i dare say one of the first ten ever made why the atmosphere the story the actors actress are all brilliant this is the theater a fairy tale the life the film paris thank you mr rivette
<START> this is a skillfully crafted piece of cinema that deals with a teenage boys confused sexuality the cut scenes within can be lengthy but the cinematography is beautiful this film would not appeal to many people especially those who are queasy about gay teenage relationships but the more open minded can sympathize with the puzzled protagonist
