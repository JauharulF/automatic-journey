<START> roll up roll up it's big gay bruce and his big gay death cannon plausible plot unnecessary decent acting unnecessary respect shown to its mighty progenitor unnecessary yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the butch bruce canon br br i mean where do you start with this film okay let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was in some way related to either the book or the original film the day of the it's not in fact it's so different and so bad that fredrick forsyth asked to have his name taken off it now i'm not necessarily a stuffy brit who can't hack hollywood remaking british films well okay maybe i am a bit like that but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case this film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive br br now let's move to the premise cheesy russian gangster gets killed in a moscow police raid somehow involving the fbi although no one bothers to explain why in revenge brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the us president although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move Â although to be fair it was pre 9 11 so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the us airforce carpet bombing eastern europe gangster hires nasty killer willis police hire cuddly killer gere cuddly killer tracks nasty killer police fanny around and periodically get killed cuddly killer kills nasty killer first lady is saved and we all realise that the ira are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know who just happen to want to kill innocent people nice br br let's put to one side the distasteful hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of northern ireland like it was a in a theme park i deal with this point more extensively on the message boards if hollywood directors want to cast the belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold that's up to them i of course reserve the right to despise them for it it's a free country br br more egregious however is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the irish while trying to support them that's not politically distasteful it's far worse it's incompetent it's no wonder for instance that gere still looks so damn good given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of p the fact that gere's accent is not only southern irish but an appalling parody of southern irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond america to make money from this film then there is that lovely scene at the end where sidney poitier a complete waste of space in this film says he's off for a coffee offers to get our cuddly ira man one then casually says ah but then you guys drink guinness don't you yeah that's right sidney the irish live on guinness and potatoes br br while we're on the subject of poitier why in the original film the detective is the tracker in gere is the tracker so what does poitier do well he just hangs around and looks like a tw at of course he's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end and he only does this because the nice ira man tells him to br br while we're on the subject of gere why i suppose it's only a matter of time before hollywood remakes gandhi with vin diesel playing ex commando mahatma gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s india he is after all a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a muslim fundamentalist let's not forget that gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work and if he's not why does he know the if he's not why does he know all his moves and if he is why is he such a limp biscuit and such a loveable person br br all this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to a think about the plot b have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character c avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend Â i honestly thought this had turned into a bond movie d give the central characters something to do e credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence br br this film is an insult to the british and irish killed at the hands of terrorists it's an insult to the irish people it's an insult to not great but pretty good film it rips off and an insult to the intelligence but most of all Â and most unforgivable Â it is an insult to my a for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish honestly you'd think with no plot no characters and no dialogue it would be over in no time but they didn't even have the decency to quit early
<START> sharky's machine finds burt reynolds as a narcotics cop who after a failed buy and bust that wasn't his fault but that got a few people killed in it he finds himself to the vice squad in atlanta br br the prestige is hardly as good as the narcotics beat but it does have its fringe benefits one night after a roundup of working girls where one of their books falls into their hands the guys ask for surveillance on rachel ward's place she's an expensive item both notorious mobster vittorio gassman and law and order candidate earl holliman br br their surveillance however records a murder and the rest of the film is sharky and his new colleagues from vice trying to solve this prestige case br br though it's a burt reynolds film and those usually have some humor to them the comedy is kept in check as the film turns as deadly serious as dirty harry it was reported in fact that clint eastwood was offered this film br br look for some good performances by fellow vice cops bernie casey and brian keith and by henry silva the coked up brother of gassman who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his job br br it's not a bad film a mixture of dirty harry and laura why laura you'll have to see sharky's machine for that answer

<START> when i typed savage intruder into the imdb's search engine one of the options it came up with was savage garden international video collection the story so far 1999 the only reason i mention this is because i'm a huge savage garden fan you should do yourself a favour check some of their music out like affirmation or to the moon and back rather than bother with this average pot boiler sorry i just wanted to say that anyway savage intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like mgm musical premiere footage a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run it's late 60's hollywood amid the glitz glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses killing them dismembering their bodies a young man named vic valance david garfield as john david garfield hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress katharine parker miriam hopkins who was 'one of the biggest stars of the motion picture' but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named mildred florence lake a personal secretary leslie blair gale sondergaard a young maid named virginia wing katharine has recently broken her foot needs a personal assistant gives vic the job slowly vic charms his way into affections more importantly her large wallet vic starts to turn katharine against the other employees but vic isn't what he seems vic is a drug addicted loon who gets greta pregnant while still having sex with katharine greta threatens to tell katharine spoil vic's devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe no one in the house is safe as vic brings drugs sex rock 'n' roll party's gardening to the parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more more apparent br br written produced directed by donald wolfe i thought savage intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time the script is all over the place it can't really decide what it wants to be savage intruder suffers from an identity crisis the film starts with the discovery of a severed head limbs straight after another woman dorothy is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them savage intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as vic befriends katharine shows her how to enjoy life again having an implied sexual relationship with her it's actually disgusting to think about as she's old enough to be his grandmother katharine stops living the life of a recluse gives up the alcohol as vic appears to make her happy as they go to party's together hold for friend like she used too this part of savage intruder wouldn't look out of place in a disney film every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by vic shooting up having silly hallucinations about his mother chopping her hand off with an axe he has sex with great at one point as well then after greta has been murdered savage intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as vic is revealed for the loony that he is savage intruder just doesn't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success similarly the murder mystery elements don't work are frankly a bit of a puzzle why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway vic as a character didn't work for me either one moment he's a cool calm clever devious con man then next he's a stark raving loony why kill all his other victims but with katharine try to con her what makes her so different if it is because she has money why not go after her to start with so many questions so few answers some of the 60's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when vic offers greta a painkiller in reality hard drugs greta says what do i need a painkiller for vic helpfully replies because your a pain wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies or when katharine suggests that vic do some gardening ask's do you have green fingers he replies no but i'm good at grass there isn't much gore in savage intruder some severed limbs a couple of decapitated heads there is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why it's repeated three or four times the silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed technically savage intruder is ok the location filming in the grandiose mansion hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves the acting is average as is the rest of the production overall i'd say savage intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away as a result just doesn't work it's a mildly entertaining one time watch at best a complete mess of a film at worse you decide which
<START> based on the 1952 autobiography a many thing love is a many thing 1955 tells the story of han focusing on the romance that han a widowed eurasian doctor in 1949 hong kong had with a married american correspondent named mark elliott i don't want to feel anything again ever han tells mark soon after they meet but the two soon develop the mutual for each other and who can blame them mark is played by william holden at the near peak of his hunky dude period the following year's picnic would be the peak in this the first of three films over the next seven years that would find holden in china 1960's the world of suzie wong and 1962's satan never sleeps being the others and dr han is here played by jennifer jones who although not a eurasian unlike yummy nancy kwan and pretty france of those other exotic holden films does a credible job of passing as one whether dressed in european frock surgical gown or hubba hubba bathing suit jones looks ridiculously gorgeous here no wonder east meets west in this film so dramatically with its two appealing lead stars breathtaking hong kong scenery beautiful cinemascope and color oscar winning costumes and that classic oscar winning title song that through the film like a lovely incense love is a many thing turns out to be quite the winning and romantic concoction han herself supposedly did not care for the picture so i can only imagine that great liberties were taken with her source material still i enjoyed it and if the film's ending causes a tear to come to the eye just remember mark's words of wisdom life's greatest tragedy is not to be loved
<START> what an excellent movie made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it so serendipitously channel surfing on a nice frozen day in north texas kathy bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing it is obvious that we as a general public are being force fed that which has been deemed great and wonderful by the powerful and influential while true gems such as unconditional love manage to shine thru all those pretenders to really enjoyable cinema rent or buy this movie you won't regret it
<START> i'm not really a t v watcher except between the ages of 6 and 8 and general hospital still had luke and laura but there are a few exceptions and i definitely think that king of queens is one of them every decade has it's classics and i think that this show will or damn well should be amongst this decade's best its comedic timing is awesome and can at times be down right odd on a more note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle and not so subtle complexities in their characters without getting too hokey one commenter wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and i agree it's definitely one that kind of grows on you but once you're in you're pretty much hooked and with good reason
<START> in truffaut book length interview with hitchcock it's apparent that big al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood his father sent him to the police station carrying a note the note said he's been naughty imprison him for an hour the policemen obliged and ever since hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police br br strangers on a train is probably one of the best in his wrongly accused series the movie is based on a patricia highsmith novel that's the same author who wrote the ripley series she was always fascinated by smart criminals br br hitchcock's opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists guy haines a famous tennis player and bruno anthony the aspiring criminal the two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew bruno tries to persuade guy that they could commit the perfect murder leaving no clues if they switch victims bruno will kill guy's wife who wouldn't give him a divorce and guy would kill bruno's father the motives are respectively love and money br br bruno's performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic this is not something that was done by accident in fact hitchcock edited two versions of the movie one us one uk in the us version the volume of bruno's seductiveness was turned down quite a bit br br strangers on a train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent hitchcock thriller an excellent example of a thrilling scene is when guy is climbing the steps up to bruno's father room hitchcock reasoned that the audience's attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they don't figure out what guy will find in the room hitch treats us to a huge menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distraction br br the most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match bruno has been continuously stalking guy so that guy will fulfil his end of the bargain kill his father when guy looks at the audience all the heads are back and forth all except one bruno's he's looking straight at guy with an i'll get you smile br br the ending is another example of suspense both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry go round that's rotating at mad speed a worker is crawling under it so he could get to the controls when we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with guy proving his innocence we are left exhausted and nail less for those of us still biting our nails br br strangers on a train is easily one of hitchcock's best wrongly accused movies some credit him with one of the best villains bruno as well all in all the movie might appear somewhat dated but that's a lesson in thriller making from the master himself i won't turn down leonardo if he came to teach me renaissance painting so neither should you br br review posted at com
<START> this movie does an excellent job of taking us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage from the inception through the ultimate reckoning the movie's impact is made even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story timothy hutton provides us with a quality understated performance and sean penn demonstrates why he is one of america's finest living actors as with midnight express this movie should make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn't be doing in a foreign country
<START> spoilers spoilers well seeing as i am a major h lots fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied
<START> the first time i saw this was when i was with a date and she thought it was an awesome movie i didn't br br the second time i saw this was last night on tv it still sucks br br as a love story this sucks as having julia portray a street hooker this is repulsive to me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels she had no tough shell to her she wasn't tortured anguished enraged starving or anything else her hooker character was so flawed like comparing a cubic to a diamond the two simply don't fit no matter what they look like br br the only cast i felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen whom were excellently cast they did such a fine job that i hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen they had real definition for the minor roles ok so the movie wasn't entirely trash the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film br br aside from those two women sales people the rest of the cast including the big names was just crap either everybody was an ass kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting julia roberts or kissing ass to richard gere br br this was a movie about how when you walk around in high heels and a tight skirt in beverly hills people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face br br while in reality the women who are dressed to the nines in beverly hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree but since they aren't wearing the gaudy madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots they can look down on the others who do br br the hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time br br this is an insult to romantic movies comedies dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect br br the story is about julia roberts being pimped yes pimped by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine br br she is still owned still told how to act how to move what to wear what to say where to go and what to do he is more controlling than a street pimp but the folks at disney buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow br br had richard gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an ak 47 at his side instead of an case this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution same story different characters will make a very different outlook br br oh yeah change the white man for a black man or asian or spanish have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away br br as far as i'm concerned pretty woman is still trash dressed with ribbons and bows br br i didn't like it 15 years ago when i didn't understand it and was led by the hollywood hype i hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called love br br this movie is not a romantic comedy it's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so br br this is an insult to strong women weak women and women in general as well as to my television screen br br do i hate it yes does it suck yes would i recommend it to you no well maybe if i really hated you br br will this review get posted we'll see br br anywayz that's all for now
<START> i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was the school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school a crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke 'getting the some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the after that they were kept in a safe and as for certain activities what can i say the film actually came out in 1982 i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time if you like british films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you another film very much like it came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again also is in the genre highly recommended but trust me 1982 is when it came out
<START> ok most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right don't get me wrong 'american werewolf in london' is a superior film but 'american remake in paris' is a decent movie as well br br first off the only real similarities are the title 2 american and werewolves other than those 3 things 'american remake in paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor action adventure and horror most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap while those of us who grew up in the 80's can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films including the b w ones horror wouldn't be what it is today now i'm getting a little off the beaten path br br an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at re creating a classic but it will never surpass the original ever with that said this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it i'm giving it a 7 out of 10 maybe that's being a little generous but i've seen much worse attempts at trying to re create a classic
<START> rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room br br leprechaun 4 jack frost and the prey br br i picked up jack and 4 because they are well known bad movies i have never seen br br i picked this movie out because it matched the how to find a bad movie guide on org no real description no pics of the movie on the back and i had never heard of it had to be a winner br br spoilers but this movie is so awful it doesn't matter p br br this is a true bad movie 4 and jack frost are dumb on purpose this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew br br this movie starts out much like evil dead even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress unlike evil dead it never gains any speed at all for a slasher movie it is pretty bland in 80 minutes 6 people get killed but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring br br the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting obviously to go along with the whole prey theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring the gore is horrible all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story br br the last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion yet another way to add length to this the climax is such a total joke its hard to laugh at it is so bad the back of the box says the ending will shock and haunt you yes it will it will shock you that someone could put such a bad plot twist on film and haunt you because you won't believe you paid to watch this crap br br also the tagline is its not human and it's got an axe one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen br br a true 1 out of 10 i love laughing at bad movies but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick p
