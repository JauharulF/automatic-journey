<START> there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies i may get to watch another one revolt of the zombies 1936 before the month is out for all star john carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the third reich with them they are not seen to do much at all james uncle remus from song of the south 1946 plays their leader who also serves as carradine's manservant black comic mantan moreland reprises his 'fraidy cat' chauffeur role from king of the zombies 1941 as does the exotically named madame te wan as carradine's housekeeper unfortunately for carradine his supreme achievement Â the zombification of his wife Â brings him all sorts of trouble not only do her relatives turn up at his remote abode lab to inquire into her sudden death which means he has to fake a funeral service but she actually proves disobedient and indignant eventually her fellow zombies to rise against their master also involved is cowboy star bob steele still best known for his bit in howard hawks' the big sleep 1946 who plays a u s secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff thankfully director would have much better luck with his next genre effort the day of the triffids 1962
<START> it ends with the declaration that the film you have just seen was an improvisation at once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an improvisation was an good movie and astounded at cassavetes' genius once again of course cassavetes told some guy it wasn't really an improvisation per se on his deathbed so it's the story about a light skinned black woman lelia who passes for white and her family another passing for white brother named ben and a black black brother named hughie when she falls in love with a white jerk named tony he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she's black and from there it goes on about the three main characters' individual aspirations and shortcomings hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure still hopelessly depressed over tony and ben is angsty and violent in general in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale patterns of existence overall i suppose it's really about stasis vs change in human life i suspect that cassavetes had the plot organized enough and it was just the dialogue that was improvised the dialogue itself is very uneven sometimes somebody will say something very memorable other times it's memorably awkward what's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors' embodiment of their characters cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do shadows whispered in the ears of the ten best students and this was the result the guys playing ben and hughie are very good at first i didn't like lelia but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds not necessarily the best with small talk shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement made in 1959 and it's definitely recommended
<START> it's wartime drama wwii with french and jews and germans but this one is somehow fun earnestly so director jean paul co wrote the script to his well received film bon voyage 2003 unlike director bertrand tavernier's safe conduct aka passer 2002 w d rolf gloomy sunday 1999 or w d claude lucie 1997 bon voyage is as chipper as its title sounds c'est la vie whatever and we have the beautiful talented isabelle adjani to thank for it is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction and attention the cause and effect of it all that made the film so enjoyable as it is hell what's another of her plan and expectations will worry about that another time the backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts as and virginie ledoyen from francois 8 women as camille the incomparable gÃ©rard depardieu the witty yvan attal of my wife is an actress and versatile peter coyote juggling french english and german here are some of the stellar cast involved br br there are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie and how it's all is a skilful knack that requires no analysis is simply a genius the story just builds upon itself one episode after another or even with overlapping events but never confusing that's the delight of it all somehow every detail turns out right on the screen and we just lap it all up like a presented french dessert literally so there's thrills tender hesitant moments and taut ominous escapes all playing out in front of our eyes br br from reading the director's note on the sony pictures bon voyage official site indicated this is his most personal and successful work ever depicting bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years this film is a labor of love all round the cast and crew complementing the director's passion and a formidable script by collaborative writers along with the director and his son julien adaptation efforts by gilles marchand patrick and tonnerre br br music by gabriel varied in tone from his previous film scores like the english patient or talented mr ripley who provided a befitting theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot going almost like a train going non stop reflecting adjani's vivacious energy even when she's tired keeping her going as she meets whatever comes walking on with head held high and stylish attire always no looking back let alone time for regrets br br ah mustn't forget the wonderfully translated skilful subtitles by ian who also did subtitles for films in italian bread and tulips 2000 aka pane e the last kiss 2001 aka l'ultimo bacio and tom tykwer's heaven 2002 br br if you find this much too light a wartime relationship drama try w d aimÃ©e and jaguar 1999 in german based on a true story with brilliant performances from juliane as aimÃ©e and maria schrader as jaguar
<START> my take the silliest of the airport movies and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies br br as if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet concorde airport '79 is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's with its bad box office results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome br br the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000 but then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the all star cast which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars tv actors and none too popular b actors the plot is sillier than ever george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni now the pilot of the concorde co piloted by co pilot alain delon en route to france after the summer olympics on board is reporter maggie whelan susan blakely who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison robert wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist to prevent her from revealing the news to the world harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing br br the cast subplots are dumber than ever even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition and the character doesn't go deeper than that j j walker a a pot smoking saxophonist arguably the most annoying character in the film eddie albert married to old wife sybil danning avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea much to the sour watching eye of coach mercedes plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo and her pet chihuahua and bibi anderson camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick in the balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies this one is in more than the sense of the word a true disaster br br rating 1 2 out of 5
<START> this movie definitely made me laugh but that doesn't mean it was exactly funny well then again me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it br br i doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before just like the plot itself all of the characters are overused movie clichÃ© cardboard box roles that don't even require acting skills accordingly such skills are not delivered we have the corrupt cop a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the forehead at so close a range as to have blood spat on his face we have the worn out cop on the edge so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie we have the old one day away from retirement cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie about as see through as a glass house on a sunny day the big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history they could've just called him wallace but just slightly tougher and more ruthless because something has to emphasize that we also know laurence fishburne from actually good movies then we finally have the highly educated doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given not using it br br the whole siege story is not interesting not original having been used twice before and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it there is the initial probe then the laying of the siege then the assault then the escape attempts meanwhile a bunch of strained stressed freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a police assault team with high tech equipment and the quite important advantage of vision then again in deep night with the power cut and with a snow storm raging overhead there is definitely a lot of light coming in so who really cares about night vision br br but the best part comes right at the end in the first scenes showing precinct 13 we see it is situated in an of an industrial city factories and office buildings surround it on all sides from this point the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up some alley ending right in the middle of a forest a forest where did that forest come from who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area how is this forest in the last scene suddenly on a hill over the city in question while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively flat br br from here i leave the judgment to you and to your common sense go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh i can really recommend it
<START> morte a venezia is one of my favorite movies more than beautiful it's really sublime it gives you important aesthetic experiences it's a masterpiece i also recommend the novel luchino visconti is a genius
<START> when they announced this movie for tnt i was excited a travesty from donald westlake's enough was one of my all time favorite stories after i watched it i was not all that thrilled recently i had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt and once again i was disappointed she didn't like it much either and she'd never read the book in this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush a big part of the problem was william h macy i like him fine in other films but he played terry carey as a stammering incompetent in the book takes a lot of valium for his nerves but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun spoilers follow they also left out a big part of the story other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy where solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police this is important not just because it's funny but because it helps set up the relationship between fred and in the movie fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting because they don't seem all that close in the book they become pretty good friends especially on fred's side which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges downfall fred also suffered a bit from casting i love adam arkin but he was not a cheerful happy to be alive upbeat sort of detective character traits which book fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking patricia and were pretty close to the book and james cromwell was great despite not looking much like martin balsam the whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding body after ships it to seattle and blaming the death on the mob kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying i don't mind changes to books to make movies i know they are necessary because of length and difficulty but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller
<START> i'm not usually into dark psychological thriller type things however seizing me is really an amazing piece of work the story acting filming psychological themes erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately my partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled it was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to get tea and i felt compelled to have a shower the story was gripping but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one straight shot it delves into the gritty and grimy side of people but doesn't leave you there i thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time i would highly recommend this one still be prepared for an experience you might not be expecting
<START> jewel thief is a rare breed of film completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation a young man vinay superbly played by a newly face lifted dev anand at age 40 is estranged from his police officer dad and finds a job in a store soon random people come up to him and call him amar using just a few pithy moments the presence of a doppelganger is established then a woman comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger she is accompanied by her loving brother ashok kumar who is so convinced that vinay is actually amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not the 6 toed one the super cute daughter tanuja is completely enamored with vinay amidst all this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will slowly we learn from encounter with a super hot night club singer helen that the thief is amar the doppelganger many many good looking women are after the hero the police force including dad are completely befuddled vinay is slowly falling for and her brother seems to bless the union the action moves to as that is where next heist is to occur the rest is for you to watch the duplicate the girls the men who hang on to every word thinking he is their boss amar the loving brother sister duo nothing seems quite right and it takes the deft story telling and direction by vijay anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner the movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in br br i was not a big fan but she is quite competent here although at her she is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing tanuja is cute as a button and i loved her in this film i so badly wanted her to get the man dev was well dev if he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect one shoulder always lower than the other i would wonder who they had found to imitate him yet his style charm and charisma were unfailing in the song yeh dil na hota only dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached ashok kumar was simply awesome dada did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books br br sd burman spun magic with numbers like hain kya helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top ke ke gaya mera and my personal favorite seductive number raat hai gaye br br if you are craving a great story with more twists than a pretzel wanting to be kept guessing yet amused and entertained then go buy or rent jewel thief better to buy it then you can go back and see it again with your buddies this one is a keeper
<START> you have to like baseball and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded to japan as his career winds down really well thought out and fascinating look at japanese customs and behavior great supporting performances by manager japan's clint eastwood his girl friend and his interpreter the chemistry between selleck and works very very well this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball look for haysbert as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill for movie wraps up very nicely easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball
<START> i've been a fan of jim henson and his characters since the very beginning the most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving a spiritual character yet sweetly and believably so all the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co exist in a caring manner together respecting each other's difference br br following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe yet this it's a very merry muppet christmas movie would have jim henson spinning in his grave these characters have been completely re written to be horny nasty selfish and cheesy br br the cast goes on to portray god as an uncaring corporate head with a mean streak angels as spineless non spiritual corporate staff and the movie was so bad i had to stop watching i had bought it for my great nephew but fortunately i preview anything i give a child br br this movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm br br shame shame on the people who re wrote the characters and departed from jim henson's original heart centered socially conscious version it does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations
<START> i having both read and watched gone with the wind found it very difficult to not compare this movie with the original although i thought scarlett the novel was superb the movie didn't add up it was a completely different story of course there will never be another scarlett and rhett besides leigh and gable but the new actors did a fine job considering i loved the way the book and movie wrapped up the story of with the wind because after reading it i felt a surge of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers to wonder what happened scarlett finishes the story very well and alexandra ripley did great on the book i just wish the movie followed the story more although it is great in itself
<START> this documentary was my first introduction to peak oil theory a fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct i had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon it literally took my breath away this movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the american way of life is dependent on the abundance of cheap oil a term used throughout the film a lot of the topics are plain common sense and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them but you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does the interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting i don't think this film is meant to scare people it's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead and maybe to encourage you to think twice about to work and leaving your lights on all day long br br after watching this film i was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same great documentary everyone should see it
<START> they give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase the main characters are involved in one constant stand off where they threaten each other every five minutes or less and i'd like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the a garcia bit it's like some local cop walking charlie manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee get real
<START> as someone who loves baseball history especially the early 20th century in which cobb was a main figure along with a ton of colorful characters i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film well it wasn't a baseball film which was disappointing no it was just a account of being with cobb in the later years while the two collaborated on a book even at that this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it br br granted cobb was anything but a nice guy an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you and he was viscous intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight he was so hated his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title one year nonetheless this an over the top portrayal of the man it makes him into something almost cartoon like br br watching and listening to an old man rant rave and profane for two hours is entertainment no it isn't some day i'd love to see a real biopic of cobb showing him in his days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy so be it but the way they did it here with just a bitter blasphemous old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch
