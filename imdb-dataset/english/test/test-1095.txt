<START> spoilers every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends whether the nazi banning of certain leaflets or the televised chinese alternative of square governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time in 1925 though celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905 the russian communist government supported the creation of this film battleship a major piece of cinematic history it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day br br set aboard the battleship the crew are unhappy in miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food they are angry at their upper class now though after the rotten food enough is enough led by aleksandr the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom br br as far as propaganda goes battleship is perfect presenting a positive light on the first unsuccessful communist mutiny the film was a useful soviet tool eighty years after the films release though and the ussr has disappeared completely off the map the amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema br br written and directed by sergei eisenstein the film is surprisingly a joy to watch it is true that it is far from what we would nowadays consider 'entertainment' but the film is a beautiful piece of art br br whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of odessa everything about this film is perfectly made the music is powerful and dramatic the lighting is flawless even the acting whilst slightly overdone is perfect for the piece basically there is no way to fault this film's end product br br it's impossible to know how the russian people received this film upon it's release praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires as a piece of art though it is magnificent beautiful from start to finish it is far from an easy watch but it is well worth the effort
<START> this stan laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the valentino film blood and sand if you've seen blood and sand then you'll probably appreciate this film and laugh at a few of the scenes that mock the valentino film however if you have not see that movie and just watch this film you'll probably not be very impressed though i really liked the title cards us the word bull was used repeatedly in very funny ways br br stanly plays a bullfighter who seems pretty dim witted and wins only because the bulls seem to lazy and non aggressive even the bull at the end of the film who has supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bull br br not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still a cute and harmless film
<START> i saw this film when it came out let me see now this guy who had earlier down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act to ski down the world's highest peak well and here comes the spoiler what happens see after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top and a life is lost in the bargain he gets on his skis manages to make it down a very very short way at which point his parachute opens and that's that and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle the guy goes ahead and releases it spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got another spoiler oh yes one of the is killed by falling into a the narrator who is quoting the daredevil skier casually remarks that according to the religion since this man's body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest is it worth it the narrator muses yes he answers because it served the purpose of letting this clown ski down everest i can't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid this is one to miss at all costs
<START> was written by and starred vivian schilling it also starred joe estevez gregg thomsen and robert as the angel of death br br the story begins with introduction to played by joe estevez we quickly learn what role will be in this movie br br next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival aptly named in this film the battle of the classes is omni present throughout the film the girls come from a wealthy class and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn't really clear or pertinent to the story br br at we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isn't encouraged to date natalie makes an appearance as well with apparently his boss the angel of death here character points out who is to die and who's souls are to be taken it's revealed as well that will have a character conflict regarding natalie and how he deals with her because of someone in his past br br meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to and zach convinces her to ride home with them during the ride home takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds br br the rest of the story surrounds the collecting the souls of the dead passengers and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live the class and character conflicts lay in the story but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved br br there's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama there's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring it's not really acceptable and it would've been nice had this been dealt with differently somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience br br the story and acting are decent the soundtrack is ok and even the production values are good br br robert in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death joe estevez does ok however sometimes his role acting a bit flat vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes br br this may sound odd but this movie definitely could've benefited from some pointless nudity vivian teases us a bit but that wasn't enough br br in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie the results it's worth watching just don't expect a perfect production br br 3 10
<START> more of a near miss than a flop mr stars as alex heir apparent to and later king of a small european nation who falls in love with a willing american actress and entertainer lana turner but due to machinations by the sly prime minister of alex as king nicely played by cedric hardwicke the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in palm springs where their love is director don hartman who also scripts is not able to fully utilize his talent for snappy dialogue because of tentative english usage and the requisite rewriting coupled with less than total rapport in evidence between the two stars results in a somewhat raggedy tone to the screenplay exacerbated by the studio's unkind cutting of many scenes leading to a confusing ending the overpowering dominates his scenes with turner but both performers score with good work while marjorie main is impressive with her patter effects as written with debbie reynolds placed on track by louis b mayer for singin' in the rain as a result of her sprightly performance here only barry sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cutting prettily filmed largely in pebble beach california and other county environs the film is endowed with iron strong operatic basso in una as well as with original songs by harold arlen and dorothy fields with douglas shearer splendidly handling the sound recording and notice must be made of the fine set decorations by edwin willis and the effective costume designs by walter
<START> sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it i thought the hair make up and characters were poor 2 dimensional types the story is doubtful especially since all of the main characters are dead or nearly dead i think it's not well acted either what was up with that hair on the main guy in the turtles it looked glued on badly and the sideburns looked like they were going to fall off at any moment it didn't feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bands and people i laughed all the way through it frank zappa looked stupid so did mama cass and so did the beatles they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous also the other band people like jim morrison donovan also took a big hit at looking stupid too kind of terrible if this is how you remember these people it's a poor history lesson on music it's fictional the way it was made
<START> this neo film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century american films that all seem to involve corrupt characters fast cars a ribbon of highway and of course plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course the actors are the best reason to see black day blue night there is the late great j t walsh swing blade pleasantville red rock west the last seduction and many more who did many neo films noirs see also breakdown then there is michele forbes of the tv series star trek the next generation and homicide in a supporting role there is even the late who also appeared on a star trek episode titled the naked now a spoiler of sorts a clue really only the most innocent survive but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this and you probably won't guess who is innocent before the final reel
<START> this show is awesome i love all the actors it has great story lines and characters it is the perfect drama james caan and josh have great dialogue they both can be really funny i miss vanessa on general hospital but she's great on here james is great he can be hilarious molly sims plays a dimwit very well the writing is awesome they keep up an excellent pace the show can really leave you hanging which is one of my favorite elements of a show i cannot wait until the new season starts this show makes it to the top ten of all my shows i hope this show stays on for a really long time if people know what good is it will i never want the show to end ever
<START> kinda boring kinda gross kinda unsettling this wasn't horrible but not too good there's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life though props to this scene not much happens and the movie just feels sort of scummy i was happy when it ended and don't believe anything about this being a true story very surprised this is averaging around 6
<START> this movie should go down in the annals of as one of the worst of all time i will stop short of saying it's the worst movie ever only because i have yet to see every movie ever made i cannot make such lofty claims until then the story is stale the acting is horrible at best the special effects are no more than a couple of lbs of dry ice and a fan somebody must have been related to someone to get this movie made mr busey mailed this one in the dog is well trained and cute making it the only redeeming quality in this never should have made it movie two hours and 3 of my life i will never get back
<START> most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life there is about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments our actress are treated like pieces of ass and seem to be perfectly happy with their position the lead characters these sons of are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them the story steps all over itself and when it finally gets to the final battle its no more than a volleyball match that doesn't last long enough to make up with this trashed script raped from the o c
<START> ray is interesting in parts and technically it's very well made but ray is often sluggish and forgets some important details about ray's life all the movie shows us is parts where he's in his prime and most successful which is good it's just i wanted to see some bits about his older life too jamie fox mimics ray charles to a t at times it's absolutely uncanny i have to say jamie is the reason i got through this movie the 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd it's more interesting it has more oomph and it's nowhere near as sluggish as the 2nd i wasn't a big fan of ray charles to begin with to be honest so i really didn't have any expectations for the film what so ever ray's biggest problem had to be the over length this could've been cut very easily with more relevant scenes other then the ones they used i found the early part of ray's life when he was just starting to get successful the most interesting he was humble back then and somewhat a gentleman and while the film may have over exaggerated his actions he got a bit too full of himself for me to care br br performance jamie fox gives a performance for the ages as ray he looks like ray talks like ray acts like ray he even sings like ray this is much more then an impression i truly believed he was ray charles he was the heart of the film and without his presence this film would've been a complete and utter bore br br bottom line ray is interesting at times dreadfully dull at others when all was said and done i was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times just because it's a film doesen't mean it's automatically oscar worthy jamie fox deserved his oscar but the movie is above average at best worth a watch but if i were you i'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level br br 7 10
<START> the movie starts out with three people on a play it by ear holiday who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go on to a little lighter activity a fishing tour br br you pick up some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to increase the suspense later during the movie as you recall what was told earlier on br br the action in the movie is well timed and not over done suspense is built through the what ifs the unknown and the sometimes gut wrenching decisions the characters make in the movie br br i found myself wondering what i would do if i was in the same boat no pun intended br br the film quality was really good and the effects where realistic believable and not over the top or cartoon looking and out of place the way you sometimes get with cgi br br as a horror movie buff i watch just about every horror movie i can get my hands on in just about every genre and this is one of the best crocodile horror movies if not the best i have seen br br watch this movie and you will not be disappointed
<START> this movie stinks imdb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey the acting is either wooden or over the top the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular and the monster scenes were mediocre at best even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie i want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole
<START> on this quagmire of mediocrity you are so much better than this br br simply put frostbite is worthless bad acting and i use that term loosely minimalist plot sophomoric humor and lackluster there's not even a sufficient display of feminine to spark the prurient interest of socially inept but red blooded males br br top gun had spectacular flight sequences to goggle at days of thunder had heart pounding racing action even point break had scenes to its credit frostbite has none of these it's not worth your time my time traci time carmen nicole's time nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something worthwhile had it not been wasted on this fodder for the recycling center br br the world will be a better place when we forget that frostbite ever existed
