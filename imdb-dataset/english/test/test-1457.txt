<START> after the turning point of night must fall robert montgomery for the most time came into his finest films and performances here comes mr jordan they were expendable the lady in the lake ride the pink horse the saxon charm june bride even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable rage in heaven mr and mrs smith but montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work in 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance he played collier lang an egotistical movie star who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend br br apparently my view of this film is a minority view most of the views given are favorable about it i thought it was a dull witless script with ann groupie heroine not very appealing as a character she admires montgomery as a star and this helps when he is called in to assist the authorities but after awhile i found there was no chemistry between them the script was also devoid of much fun although montgomery and roland winters did try the only thing i recall to this day as a joke point was that taylor holmes is the wealthy father of blyth and he is an admirer of winston churchill so he always dresses up as churchill and we see him wearing a floppy broad hat smoking a large cigar and painting holmes' bald head helps in the disguise that was the most memorable joke from this film not much of a real memory br br montgomery went into early television and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures his last contact with the movies was his direction of the gallant hours about admiral william bull halsey starring his friend jimmy cagney it is a far better film than this for his overall film and television career i will give this mediocre film a 4 that strikes me as generous
<START> this don siegel clint eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the wayside in 1971 and what a pity a fascinating character study with some great women for squint to deal with geraldine page was one of our supreme actresses and she's perfectly cast young jo ann harris is a flirty minx and elizabeth hartman who died too young is undeniably repressed br br a 7 out of 10 best performance c eastwood released the same year as dirty harry this did no business beside getting some good reviews seek this out unless you're only into explosion films very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you
<START> this is probably the only female ninja movie ever made it's great as a b film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch this movie is just so deliciously 80's you'll never see another film like it check it out for some 80's retro fun
<START> if there's one thing i've learnt from watching george romero's creepshow it's that if you stumble upon an mysterious old crate that someone has obviously gone to a lot of effort to hide just leave well alone there's probably something nasty inside br br obviously professor gordon crowley robert englund's character in brooks monster isn't a romero fan 'cos he busts open the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard only to ancient demon that possesses his body initially causing him to eat and vomit rather a lot br br when the demon eventually erupts from body during chemistry class and begins to transform the students into hellish flesh tearing beasts it's up to plumber jack brooks trevor matthews to try and stop the foul creatures armed only with a length of pipe and fuelled by a lifelong hatred of all things monstrous br br the dvd packaging for jon low budget monster flick promises one hell of a fun ride offering cheesy thrills and spills of the kind one might expect from your average 80s creature feature toothy critters rubber monster suits gruesome gore and absolutely no cgi Âand for the last 15 minutes that's exactly what viewers get non stop splattery effects a silly tentacled jabba style demon thingy and mucho macho monster mashing br br it's a shame then that the rest of the film's running massive 70 minutes or mostly spent following jack as he goes about his boring everyday business plumbing visiting his shrink going to chemistry class and upsetting his girlfriend if you think you might enjoy a film that focuses primarily on coping with childhood trauma and anger management buying spare boiler from a hardware shop and the chemical properties of sodium then this is the film for you but if it's a massive dose of monster mayhem you're after then i'd advise looking elsewhere
<START> henri georges clouzot's film is quiet an example of the french transition cinema a film between the realism of the postwar cinema and the full of magic and symbolism nouvelle vague with some spots of the american classic films but not imitating it the director tales us a story about love crime and the importance of points of view we can find great actors too suzy is impeccable br br is interesting too how we can find aspects of this film nowadays quai des inheritance is palpable in woody allen tradition plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment the naive ending is also typical in steven spielberg's good ending films and finally i would like to point out the deja sensation during the photography session between jenny lamour suzy and dora simone in which the first one confess that she thinks her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her that scene is exactly the one between natalie portman and julia roberts in closer mike nichols 2004
<START> a very potent drama of small town south dealing with an innocent black man's murder of local ne'er do wll striking cinematography and good narrative via flashback take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer a still powerful story that predates the sidney poitier films of racial prejudice porter hall has a great role as the murdered man's father trivia this was actually filmed in home town of oxford miss with many of the residents used as extras
<START> i saw this film in the movie theater i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense it is a woodward film about one of second city's native sons br br everyone knew about johns history everyone knew how he died some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy br br but hey the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect br br this movie well forget the idea of poor michael who is a really great actor being in a really astonishingly bad film and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man br br forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of belushi's work and all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie br br screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob work kinda saying okay we are about to mess with belushi now lets go after woodward too they also decided to take the premise of it's a wonderful life and turn it into it's a horrible life on crack br br is he a guardian angel or the devil is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie it is one of those movies after it is over you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go what the hell was that in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic but for good reason br br a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of or throw out snappy one liners to the screen a cult film is never good and most people would never watch them in any serious context br br if you want to watch some classic bad late 80's fair stoned rent wired if you want to know about john belushi you can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie
<START> it is 1969 phoebe camilla belle is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister faith cameron diaz faith is the doer the truth seeker the fixer of all the wrongs in the world then one day phoebe and her mother gail blythe danner receive word that faith is dead faith has killed herself both phoebe and gail are overwhelmed by this news and although saddened gail mourns phoebe can't let it go phoebe decides to go to europe and find out what happened br br it is now 1977 phoebe jordana brewster is 18 and decides to go to europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth when alive faith was inseparable from a man she called wolf christopher eccleston though wolf claimed not to know anything about faith's last days phoebe convinces him to tell her everything within days wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins phoebe on her pilgrimage to portugal br br in the end wolf is able to tell of faith's decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide although angry phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was br br i liked this movie i'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the red army and i was 10 in 1969 this story was familiar ground for me i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft br br the story is simple but probably occurred several times in real life during that period camilla belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her jordana brewster slid easily into the role of the older phoebe blythe danner was the ever supportive mother a role she is all too familiar with on american tv unfortunately i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with cameron diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly though at times her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel of all the characters it was christopher eccleston's wolf that made the most growth when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie we can see he is a worldly man he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices in the end he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to grow up deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death eccleston's wolf is the most real of all the characters br br i recommend this movie it was enjoyable and thought provoking the invisible circus is rated tv ma but there is very little cursing sex or violence in it the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating
<START> doctor who is amazing it is everyones of it must be the boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around br br billie piper was extraordinary as rose tyler she was so emotional and made rose so real br br david tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch br br but now billie has left and rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on off boyfriend mickey and her mother and father he died when rose was a baby but this pete tyler is from the parallel universe it will be very strange with martha being the new companion as i have only ever seen it with rose apart from the runaway bride with catherine tate br br better be good br br but nobody can beat rose
<START> i won't go to a generalization and say it's the best love story of all time as some have said that's fine people feel very deeply about this film you either love it i believe or you simply hate it i don't want to say the best of all because that is simply too for me to make a statement like that however i feel very passionately about the english patient as well as millions of other people do br br the awards say it all br br i don't agree with critics on many levels however the ones that picked this one i couldn't agree more br br 9 oscars br br 41 wins br br 37 other nominations makes this love story on the top of the bunch br br from the director anthony the story that bursts onto the screen and as mr from t v s seinfeld said elaine i simply can't take my eyes off of it in this instance i don't agree with response but the story builds and takes the right time needed to make it's case beautifully the cinematography john won multiple awards as well as it ought too i have not really paid much attention to juliette binoche until now well not entirely true i loved her performance in sabrina lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship next to harrison ford but this was simply an incredibly differing character for her and as deeply talented as she is she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way she was just what this film was looking for i'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress ralph fiennes was also spectacular in portraying count de i had a new respect for his ability after seeing this one what can you say except see this picture again
<START> this show is the single greatest thing to come out of america since the simpsons not only does it have thousands of new ideas but it's actually controversial see the jewish joke season 1 episode 1 and isn't scared to tick people off however the great minds at fox have canceled it along with greg the bunny and futurama so make sure you buy the season 1 box set while you still can it'll be the best money you ever spend it's definitely a show that gets better the more you watch it as at first the constant flashbacks can get a little annoying and don't always seem to fit the story properly however after a couple of episodes you realise how brilliant it is and how well it compares to any other show currently on air at the moment
<START> i still can't describe what to feel when i received this by the site such a rare movie so little spoken and known is difficult to find even to fans but the contrast past and present is devastating now i hold a dvd of the movie with the finest quality possible as i did in atlantis the other rare movie i bought by the internet i saw this one at home with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off and marveled at the experience i didn't know what to expect wickedly i always searched some kind of disappointment when i saw a film by luc i never had seen before but it never came this movie was no exception from the start i understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future and so it happened this won several prizes including the highest prize in a film festival of my country which makes me proud and it shows that this movie is many bigger things this may be the most original after the war movie i have ever seen beating mad max in originality and artistic feel there is not a problem with this movie its cinematography is genius as well the perfomances of the actors i am also proud to say that finally i saw all the movies of my favorite director and have a copy of almost all of them joan of arc is still waiting for me to buy the dvd this movie is most of all a work of style and dedication which makes clear why luc is a director of my choice good taste beautiful framing excellent use of music i also marveled at eric first feature length score and the promise of great achievements did well to bet in its boy genius the man who would later change the face of france's and europe's relation between movies and their public let's hope starts working in a new directorial project i will be the first to cheer it until then i recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money i loved the atmosphere of the movie which by its black and white cinematography suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust this movie works by the sheer magic of movies showing in pictures what we can't explain by words and i'm with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it good choice a great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed
<START> i highly recommend this movie to everyone my son and i read the book first and then saw the movie while the book was better in my opinion the movie was still great my son and i agree that while we like the book version the best we liked the ending of the movie better than the book ending the scenery is just tremendous and the soundtrack is a must have the fact that jimmy buffett has a small role and provides music is an added plus luke wilson does a decent job in his role of officer and is pretty much what i had mentally imagined would look like when i read the book i'm surprised that this didn't do better in the theaters and i'll be waiting for the dvd to come out
<START> in the line of fire is one of the best thrillers i have seen it builds and builds to a great climax this film really draws you in your heart is beating and you are out of breath from the action the cast turns in strong particularly clint eastwood and john malkovich this film is expertly directed by suspense master wolfgang petersen thrillers don't get much better this don't miss it
<START> this this coming of age dramedy set in chicago in the early 60's we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives the two central characters are leroy preach jackson turman and his best friend richard morris hilton jacobs both of these boys have promising futures preach is a great writer but a lazy student and has just received a college scholarship for basketball when they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls they're skipping school riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends br br things go wrong when preach and make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car the police pursue them and they are arrested but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher snl's garrett morris they are released but the two hoods are not and vow to get revenge on preach and thinking they blamed the whole thing on them br br this movie is very episodic but it still works because thats what life is a series of episodes some funny some sad some romantic some bizarre the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic and the situations are all believable and relatable like preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight or dealing with a bratty younger sibling but even when a situation isn't personally relatable like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie the sequence is still hilarious br br high' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'what's ' which aired on abc from 1976 1979 even though the show is most famous for the character rerun he is not in this film nor is there any character remotely like him the humor of that show was very broad but still funny the humor of high' is truer to life and thus more entertaining br br additionally the soundtrack is wonderful classic songs from that period by diana ross the supremes the temptations martha the and smokey robinson play throughout the film adding to the fun youthful exuberant tone of the film
