<START> the antiwar musical hair is my number one cult movie i do not know how many time i have seen this film in the movie theaters and on vhs or how many times i have listened the cd with the stunning soundtrack and now this masterpiece has been finally released on dvd in brazil br br the pacifist and touching story is still amazing a hymn of freedom friendship and liberty of choices and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war i do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's i do not recall who won the oscar in 1979 but treat williams and john savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances beverly d'angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper class teenager i have seen hair probably more than twelve times and my eyes always get wet while berger walks to the airplane singing that's me that's me that's me and i start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery i believe this is one of the most beautiful sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history my wife my daughter and my son also love this film therefore i can guarantee that hair is timeless and recommended for any audience my vote is ten br br title brazil hair
<START> i don't know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set as it is in the middle of the war macy has returned from the war his neighbor asks hey is it true you got a fritz over there and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses hence the name and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid anti semitism and macy and dern could wrapped up in it funny how neither is jewish in this film but the accusation is made also it is historically accurate as the labor union democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of america and god macy is continually pestered to come to the meeting his presence brings unexpected results br br applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast in 2005 has undergone a complete reversal with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their supporting the republican party and viewing organized labor as part of left wing america br br a great picture to watch if you care to see the friendly timid and meek macy played beautifully by him get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40's in nyc br br a tough emotionally charged film
<START> this film sucks it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random good gore but little plot sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon i figured that she had pms it sure seemed that way the dubbing in this film is horrible one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio i knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the us i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film some good characters but not many not worth wasting one's time
<START> barely came trough the whole movie acting is bad dialogs are even worse felt kinda 4 watching it but it was named the same as one of my favorite games so i struggled trough they even screwed up the sound at certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud that i had to turn the volume down it would be great if this was a competition about who can screw up more br br oh and ps i don't know what's this guy uwe capable of creating i certainly don't think this movie is bad just because he's the director i checked the list of his work and this is his first and probably the last creation that i've seen br br over out
<START> since the characters begin with unknown identities they not identified by name so you start with handsome james caviezel waking up in a warehouse he finds out the place is locked up tight don't ask the windows are made with security glass and it's impossible to get out four other awakening men make it a quintet mr caviezel in his jean jacket barry pepper in a ranger shirt greg kinnear with a broken nose joe pantoliano as a chair bound man and jeremy sisto shot and handcuffed man oh manÂ br br these five men have collective amnesia they think that three of them are kidnappers and two are victims but they don't know who is which or which is who the is due to a pipe leak don't ask it happens meanwhile on the outside lead lawman david selby as parker sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men's wives bridget moynahan as eliza coles frantically waits but criminal gang leader peter stormare in boots is also on his way to the scene br br like the dvd synopsis says as secrets are revealed and clues unraveled the five men must race against time to figure out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive this story reads a lot better than it looks on film unfortunately when the secrets are finally revealed and memories become clear there is no longer much interest in what has happened simply director simon brand has a great premise with matthew idea but they light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick br br unknown 11 1 06 simon brand james caviezel barry pepper greg kinnear david selby
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in my life if you're looking for a nice theatrical effect skip it and watch something else br br but if you're looking for camp value this is it here's my advice gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it
<START> the director seems like a good solid man his parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with they strayed from each other they loved each other they misunderstood each other and the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of long island br br there are few interesting choices in this documentary the music is banal the filming uninspired and the story is the same story that has played out on every birch street in every town in america i don't mean to sound too harsh seldom has a sweeter more well intentioned documentary been made the director is the kind of man with whom you'd want to be friends you just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive
<START> i attempted to watch this and was highly disappointed don't expect intelligent and insightful humor ala amy's brother david amidst this dreck it is the polar opposite but if you're into poop fart and boner jokes you'll be in seventh heaven this is bathroom humor aimed i assume at those who've had several which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as the best television writing ever i assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high end comedy the characters overact the shock factor is set to 10 and the laughs are set to zero unless of course you seek juvenile low brow humor br br i made it through 40 minutes praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment but alas it just got worse and worse and beware of amy's ever present and hammy overbite expression it will set your eyes rolling it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the sedaris family br br to those who loved it i'm sorry this is my opinion it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review
<START> i loathe despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison it's nothing but a campy frightening and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that oh so nasty time the 70's a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer br br the animation is sickeningly dated not least of all with it's tacky missing frames and characters with huge bulbous heads this film is an eye sore from the knowing snide nod to the parents with the gay sea horse and it's camp hand motions and kenneth williams esque voice to the overtly unsubtly druggy anthem high this film im sad to say is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me br br this ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an r rated certificate so disturbing it is in it's contents
<START> my father has worked with top secret information in the dia before and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me when i was a kid i would always ask him what would happen if he gave away secrets and he recommended this movie br br in the movie it really puts 2 almost completely different friends in a tangle they never really knew what the outcome would really be the snowman really cracked me up because the movie portrayed him as just some drug pusher that did not know what he was arguing about and in the movie it seemed like he got the worst of everything the falcon chris is just a guy that wanted to express his feelings on u s government in a very radical view br br for movie lovers this is a must see
<START> if this is not heavily featured on every list of what not to watch it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence which as long as that remains so is the acceptable alternative i'm not kidding you this is a bad movie joseph meeker returns from the dead with various vague undefined supernatural powers the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new increasingly comical looking and ridiculous and never scary or creepy in general when this goes for the latter of those it winds up just being bizarre and attempts at the former just don't work period outfits and stereotypes archetypes and he is portrayed by david keith whom i respect in well at least daredevil doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent which could also have to do with script and often over the top performance a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is and what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks cinematography oh dear framing coverage effective use of angle that one could be attributed some to editing too perhaps please guys stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of as far as the technical side goes this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than film but why stop there the plot is just poor the basic idea's been done and it's been done so much better than this the crow would be one the way it's told is gimmicky and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks it still doesn't satisfy pacing is about non existent the lead is distinctly unlikeable and there's more personality in a barn door not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden kelly and thomas ian nicholas what in the name of all that is good and just pun intended are you doing in this you were already funny before this on the drew carey show nicholas well i haven't seen you in anything preceding american pie but if nothing else you were funny later on and in those productions the amusement was intentional dialog is the less said the better language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid the violence is shoddily done and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy characters don't get me started why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting at times utterly illogical events the more you think about this the worse it gets it's not even passable as a bad horror flick or a b movie it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet and go further still it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is and don't say i didn't warn ya 1 10
<START> if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it this film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to i wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy it is a low budget movie with amateur actors it looks like it was filmed for a film contest the acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a hee haw script writer my family laughed at it a grade zzzzzzzzzzzzz all the way you won't be scared by this one here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film when the guy gets his toe stomped by ric white's stupid portrayal of the reverend james johnston walking cane the guys reactions are like if he had an amputation with no pain killer watch the dvd extras after you watch the movie when you see ric white and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck don't get fooled like we did and buy this failure
<START> i went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining the only thing i enjoyed about it was when robin williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill and the end when he seems to get killed glenn close was obnoxious and she obviously did not seem old enough to be mother a mother like would have had her kids taken away by the department of children and families br br robin williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me he has two roles he can play funny person or sad tragic good hearted victim see the fisher king good morning vietnam and all of his so called dramatic roles it is always the same performance put them all together into one long mini series glenn close is always a cold fish remember fatal attraction would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single did you feel any sparks between her and michael douglas have you ever seen glenn close warm up any screen john lithgow had the only interesting role this was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick abnormal dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound
<START> the 2002 version of the time machine is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects br br what a lousy uninspired bland story with no imagination why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci fi classic are today's movie audiences too hip for the h g wells writing largely as is the 1960 george pal version told a much more endearing story even with clunky low budget effects beach party looking and that looked like smurfs on steroids br br the 2002 version must have h g wells turning in his grave br br 1 the idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci fi clichÃ© this totally distracts from the love affair with mara what happened to that made the 1960 version so endearing this sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour if guy character was so brilliant either he or his buddy einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma Â not have it dawn on him 800 000 yrs in the future Â from a no less doh what's wrong with time traveling just for fun adventure curiosity as embodied in the 1960 version br br 2 only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it the george pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of though a 4th dimension br br 3 the director goes out of his way to make character look geeky a worn out old stereotype of scientists in the 1960 version rod taylor was a little nerdy too at least around but managed to be swashbuckling playful and charming br br 4 among the key themes of the 60's version abandoned in the remake is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is pointless and doesn't do much for science literacy for over 4 billion years the moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker yes science fiction needs artistic license but this is just plain dumb and meaningless br br 5 destroying the time machine is stupid too apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing blowing up the machine to kill is sort of a cop out ex disappointingly pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends a key part of the wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back br br 6 having running around in the daytime totally ruins h g wells' wonderfully spooky ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night a true cinematic opportunity lost also wells depicted the as frail and childlike these guys in the movie looked like they could take on if they weren't such big baby wusses br br 7 the one smart Â kind of a bleached out star wars evil emperor had potential but is so lame and aloof he tells pearce to take his machine and go home boy what a dramatic high point in the book the steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and fight to keep it br br 8 the goof ball hologram at the n y public library is too much it makes light of the idea of human cannibalism the 1960 version simply had the talking rings that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind derailed evolution is serious stuff br br its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script save the cost of a ticket popcorn and go rent the dvd when it comes out soon no doubt at least you can fast forward thought the dull parts just like our time traveler
<START> e elias begotten is a one of a kind surreal depiction of the mankind's treatment of religion there are a couple of different ways you can interpret things but the plot itself is simple a god himself and out of his corpse springs mother earth mother earth then the god's corpse post mortem and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed following this she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers presumably in infancy but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth this all takes place in the first 15 30 minutes and after that the rest of the film consists of robed figures dragging the messiah who is incessantly quivering or seizing across a desert landscape the robed figures pause only to the messiah then continue to drag him around br br there are a couple of ways to interpret this depending on your level of optimism and your world view it can easily be interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that christian deities can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance its own selfish goals or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro christian allegory in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted christ's message around so much that it's original purity and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are inappropriately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence to war to totalitarianism br br the visuals of this film are phenomenal and you will not see anything like it period if you can watch the original vhs release i recommend it i'm not sure if the visuals are changed on the dvd but i have seen clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects are seriously diminished on the vhs version achieved total contrast meaning there basically aren't any mid tones except for some grain in some of the shots other than that this film offers the rare opportunity to see pure white and pure black and the result is stunning hallucinatory and quite unsettling this film makes film noir look positively washed out and mediocre the shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls un chien andalou without completely aping it for an effect that has been called a filmic test br br that being said the film can certainly try a viewer's patience and commitment there isn't any dialogue for starters the only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets chirping peppered occasionally with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities and an droning synthesizer texture personally i find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the instrumental nin remixes from the downward spiral era more abstract noise experimental music like f ck buttons and odd it also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal basically any music with extreme textures and or hypnotic rhythms that's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film it is prime for postmodern re like projecting it during a performance of avant garde music or composing avant garde music to accompany it br br once the messiah figure is born there really isn't much change for the rest of the film meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being drug around the desert and beaten it looks bleakly beautiful but there isn't really anything new unfolding it helps to cement the filmmakers intentions of communicating that for thousands of years now people have been using christ's name and image for personal benefits but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span basically if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense look elsewhere if you are looking for a unique film experience and you aren't particularly fond of mainstream hollywood cinema this could be your quivering messiah
