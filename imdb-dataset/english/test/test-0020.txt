<START> nurse charlotte beale the lovely rosie has arrived to dr clinic for the insane prepared for a new job what she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after stephens is attacked by axe wielding maniacal judge oliver w cameron in a running gag anytime he confronts a situation out of his control he retreats to repeating his name that doctor is geraldine masters annabelle who isn't sure about whether beale is a proper fit for their establishment after a long discussion about the position which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about being sent a letter by stephens getting a job at the clinic with masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position but the good doctor may not be who she seems br br the assortment of loonies includes sam bill mcgee a simple minded child man who was last victim of lobotomy jennifer warren a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at masters' heel like a puppy danny jessie kirby a trouble making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed harriet camilla carr allyson betty chandler a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees sergeant hugh your typical case of soldier who hasn't escaped the madness of war br br the film shows masters' unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into question and not to mention the fact that oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping dr stephens with an axe and what exactly happened to dr stephens ah ha br br tacky 70's drive in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema i'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature you just never know what the hell might happen especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended some consider the low budget a liability but in the case of this film i think it enhances the experience with the cheap photography and weak production values being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location it seems creepier and i felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in
<START> one of the finest movies i have viewed good script original plot of a man who is haunted about jfk's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold november day in 1963 thirty years later another anti social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president the secret service agent loses his partner along the way to the crazed gunmen who schemes lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission br br the movie accompanies with a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between russo and eastwood which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work is great sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played but how many could acted with such craftiness and intellect that he displayed in the movie br br needless to say i thought this was a great movie everytime it's on television i have to watch it and i own it on dvd i'm a big eastwood fan this only boosted his already fabulous career and best role to date br br
<START> i saw this at my in laws' house one night when it popped up on tv and my mother in law said it was one of her favorite movies well she can have it br br look i can enjoy a chick flick now and then as long as it's good but this one's extra sappy unrealistic and just plain predictable despite some decent performances from rock hudson and jane wyman it's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her oh well they say love is blind br br the neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag too and how often did we need otto kruger repeating the title it happened not once not twice but three times
<START> along the history of cinema there's been a few films that deceived the viewer such as hitchcock's stage fright alejandro abre los ojos david fincher's the game and this one absent to begin with i don't like this kind of films i feel like somebody is trying to pull my leg br br furthermore after seeing this film one doesn't know what happened is such a confusing film kubrick's the shining may be a better or a worse movie but definitely is more honest than this load of pretentious and dubious situations br br technically is fine nice photography fair performance and so on but the script is so poor i wonder what did the producers see to carry on and shoot this crap br br and this film remarks the 3 guys that wrote the script and are lost in cinema trying to make a masterpiece or trying to do something to fulfill their stomachs awaiting for more personal projects
<START> took a very good book and completely butchered it nothing was as it should have been some of the best parts of the book were missing including the major point of the whole book simply the worst adaptation of a stephen king novel ever this movie made the mini series for it look good
<START> i had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival herzog introduced the film and did an hour long q a afterward br br this is a brilliantly done documentary herzog explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes camouflage the truth instead he scripts some scenes and ad libs some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outline br br little dieter unlike timothy is a real person that you fall in love with you cheer for him you feel the anguish that he feels you admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after he was taken into captivity by the viet cong you are disappointed to hear afterward that dieter passed on not too long ago br br as in most herzog films the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music especially a scene of battle taken from archives of the viet nam war but fitting the story line of dieter br br the core of the film has dieter return to the hellish jungle where he was a pow and he re enacts his journey with some locals harrowing for us to watch i can't imagine what he felt as he was bound again br br one of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the viet nam war it should serve as a lesson to us all
<START> norman final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings Â bringing his accident prone milquetoast up to date this being a product of the swinging sixties the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star's typical slapstick and sentimentality with mild sexuality and even milder satire the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager sally geeson who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either sarah atkinson appears as friend who warns norman of her fickle character br br the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard maltin's bomb rating would have it and if anything is interesting for its treatment of mid life crisis being in many ways similar to hoffman 1970 and 10 1979 Â both of which incidentally i've only just watched towards the end norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track
<START> well as you can see i got to this party quite late but have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments i found this site by happen chance when i was looking for other marine corps films so let me start by telling you that i played a marine boot in the movie pvt and was stationed at san diego at the time jack webb and his crew selected 15 permanent personnel of which some of us had the speaking parts and another 15 marines that had just completed boot camp that made up the platoon and the marines who portrayed the various dis to the best of my recollection the capt and pvt owens don were not in the marines we spent about three weeks up in hollywood studio city film lot ca shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with and then they completed the other shots after we left br br so as i ramble along here let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous entries as best i can cuff daddy was commenting about the ability of our platoon to yell yes sir without moving and etc yes we did the yelling for the sound guys and it was while shooting the scene as you fellow marines remember when the di or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it you had already taken your breath of air enabling you to yell at the top of your lungs the proper response that is how it was done br br commented about walking through the same building at paris island however as i mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in studio city ca they were built from photos taken at paris island and from on site trips and marine advisers from paris island sorry you were in the real buildings not the sets br br brought up many good points but about the incident with the platoon at paris island at the time all that jack webb said to us was the movie came about because of the accident and the marine corps didn't want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the marines that died that night although the marine corps would provide any marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a marine di does what he does br br as mentioned by a few of you i also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been cleaned up to much and obviously isn't how it goes down in real life back in the 50's that is how it had to be done br br one story i would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us marines and the movie crew and between the movie crew and jack webb from the start by custom the marines replied yes sir to anybody that moved going into the second week it was getting more common to hear yes sir coming from all directions on stage someone would bark out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a catwalk above the set a reply of yes sir would sound out to all of this at one of our informal gatherings jack webb stated if i had known that i would have gotten this much respect from this crew i would have brought you guys up here years ago there was a lt brought up from san diego to play the role of the di from the other platoon and the one jack webb fights with but during one shooting he was up to take number 32 and still webb kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didn't show any lack of patience with him the next day they used the paris island adviser who was a di sgt from paris island and he worked out fine br br at the time i was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the still camera man to get some pointer from him and as it turned out he would give me still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used those film strips i cut up and made slides out of them after the movie came out in vhs tape the di b w 106 min my kids and the grand kids have a blast when they try to se who can find me the most times on the screen
<START> i almost stopped watching hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines one exception for this is ramgopal verma movies this is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast this is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories the adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good you should watch this movie for nana patekar based on the life of mumbai cop this movie deals in a more realistic way the film delves into the life of the common man which he has apart from being an encounter specialist i rate this as one of the best movie of the year
<START> big and we mean plus sized big baddie sebastian cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights when sea faring sterling pop is killed how will haden put an end to terror in a texas town armed only with a harpoon br br first off this isn't a b western there are no singing cowboys no daredevil stunts no interesting action sequences it's just an independent movie you know the ones that use unimportant actors to say important things and cover the general low budget of the goings on with interesting camera angles br br second this movie to avoid compromises one expects that would cause the elimination of important statements about justice in america and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl is really low budget the main problem that causes is that the acting is really really bad sterling haden is decent enough in tough roles but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west sebastian cabot tries to do a sydney greenstreet as very bloated it's not a bad idea but cabot does not have the acting chops for it the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul johnny has the best role in the film he does nothing with it br br third the script really isn't all that gets some digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town and the people when up against real oppression tend to back down this is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 high noon bad day at black rock devil's doorway are all westerns that deal with the evils of western society with an eye to the evils of 50s america in certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them br br so given all the negatives why does this movie get a 4 mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie the relationship between and his girl is um fascinating and while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them just when one is ready to pass out from indy movie boredom will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack br br if you don't like or westerns give this one a miss otherwise try it you might like it more than i did
<START> yeah i know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place it's hilarious br br if you want some accuracy this is not a movie to rely on it starts with the flight from sÃ£o paulo to rio aboard a 747 this will never happen on the 400 km flight smaller planes such as 737 or a shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour the drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known drivers when faced to tourists not that it would be a local habit as i myself got ripped off in very serious places such as switzerland the girls yes all topless that's something an outsider will never understand brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100 of their incredible bodies at the samba schools parades and wear almost non existent bikinis at beach but never go topless a handful beaches across the whole country will allow it all carefully secluded and out of town oh the indoor decoration the amazing wallpaper maybe in disneyworld apart from that it is very entertaining and yes demi moore is absolutely splendid
<START> i truly love horror films try to give every one i see as much credit or sometimes more as possible but this is really pushing the ticket most of the cast were very like able but hardly any of them could act at all but then again think about the writing dialogue of this mess some good make up but absolutely ridiculous special fx all in all i give it 3 out of 10 am having second thoughts about that
<START> paul muni and bette davis overact monstrously while lacklustre studio hack archie mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives its bittersweet ending by condoning segregationist attitudes heavy handed and poorly constructed the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never recovers from as mr muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent fashion br br johnny ramirez is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and grit attains a law degree from a store front night school in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only ineptitude and is quickly made to look the fool by his well heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends he be disbarred devastated by the setback an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by the owner charlie eugene palette who likes his style the owner cuts him in on the place but problems arise with mrs davis who also wants a piece of johnny she kills charlie implicates johnny and slowly goes mad before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from different tribes savage and it will never work when she flees to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood that its best to stay with your own br br in addition to this appalling denouement has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story unfair as his plight might be muni's ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni her lady macbeth mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era margaret lindsay as muni's american dream is cold remote and flat br br bad as is and it is very it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes the rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction
<START> it's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen it never lags it never slows down it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot that along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie aamir and salman are outrageous even raveena and karishma are funny in this movie paresh rawal and shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy but viju and the wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad guy intentions if you want to laugh and enjoy a movie watch this movie do it with family or friends you will not regret it most indian movies tire me out by the end cause they are 3 hours long this movie is just as long but i wish there was more when it ends cause it's an amazing flick
<START> i wish i was first exposed to this in a movie theater when it was first released as some of the commentors had been it really is a treasure to be fair i have not seen any other version of goodbye mr chips and neither do i want to to me this stands as a perfect version i first saw it on tcm years ago and never forgot it i had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday although i had recorded it from tcm days earlier there were portions of the movie in which both of us were teary eyed it really is a moving movie br br and shouldn't that be what movies are all about br br the music is beautiful the film was shot wonderfully the acting is top notch and the story is delicate and timeless br br one of my favorite movies of all time
