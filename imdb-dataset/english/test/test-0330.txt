<START> i'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie i'm not counting super bug budget no storyline batman's either br br a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the the black scorpion can be added to that collection br br if you've seen the then get this movie it's basically a copy of that heroine it even stars the same guy in both movies br br if you haven't then let me explain a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance she laces up the black outfit a sexy skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan and goes out to kick some booty br br it's a fun action packed movie mind you you may not wish the kids to see it without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene has in it which in my opinion was a bonus alright give it an extra star grin
<START> if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical or torah portrayal of the events in exodus you will be disappointed by this movie in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the bible have been created for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father in law instead of a shepherd priest who gave moses excellent advise god is largely removed from the movie and instead viewers are given the impression that moses had to figure things out for himself nothing could be further from the truth br br this movie is a typical humanistic twist on biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on moses for trying to understand what god wants and what he should do those who know the book of exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie but outright glaring changes to events most importantly they will see a near total absence of god's dialog with moses which determines everything moses does after the burning bush far from being alone as portrayed in the movie moses is guided by god with detailed and direct communication br br even hallmark apparently can't acknowledge god's direct role and without his spoken words to moses many events make no sense to compensate hallmark has actually changed some things for instance after the golden calf god plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live hallmark creates a civil war instead and the israelites pick sides then slaughter each other moses side wins of course br br there may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers but believers should stay away the twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their bible read exodus for yourself there is no substitute
<START> plodding maybe that should have been the title bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace all the characters are single dimension with the exception of one unfortunately that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this clichÃ© ridden two hour drag having grown up in the seventies this film is seriously lacking in detail atmosphere and authenticity surprisingly this was produced by kelsey grammar someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script cameron richardson is about the only element that lights up this film robin music is also a welcomed addition
<START> best fan boy movie i've ever watched save free enterprise br br in some ways it reminded me of an early kevin smith film br br if you do any kind of role playing this movie will likely have you laughing often at its insatiable fun don't expect a big budget here the acting is also questionable at times but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create the script is truly humorous with a lot of witty moments worth experiencing br br the bard that always gets killed had me rolling the sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too but in the end it was just a great movie showcasing some better moments in the lives of a few geeks having a great time with role playing br br if you are bored and ever got into role playing this will do nicely for a distraction a real unexpected treat
<START> did a great job nice concept well executed and tightly produced came across as a very sincere story as a fan of curb your enthusiasm where jeff was pretty much the straight guy role i was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal br br much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy which i really liked rather than being slapstick or over explained and there were some nice little surprises and twists the convenience store vignettes were a delight br br when i say it is a wonderful small film i don't mean budget or quality it is simple intimate and hand crafted it tells a highly believable everyday story relax and go see it let it wash over you and you will feel good for having done so
<START> my kids loved this movie we watched it every chance we got it was fun a fun movie we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again even after all these years they remember it that amy jo johnson was a very cute girl all my boys had crushes on her they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with as you can tell i am rambling a bit to fill lines lol but seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching disney please give us a dvd or replay
<START> this movie blew me away i have only seen two episodes of the show never saw the first movie but went to a pre screening where johnny knoxville himself introduced the movie telling us to off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half ' he was right as a movie this would probably rate a 2 given it has zero plot no structure besides randomness and very little production value however that isn't the point everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through not only were some of the stunts creative see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best or worst depending on how you want to look at it but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise these guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews and probably can't even be published here involving lots of things below the belt however almost 3 4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical even if morally but remember statement and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on tv so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into some stuff is disgusting but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all as a person who thought jackass the tv show was an over hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain the amount of fun i had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in it's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the borat movie comes out with this movie you may think you know what you're getting but these guys are a few steps ahead of you i guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch so enjoy and don't worry you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home
<START> fame is one of the best movies i've seen about the performing arts the music and the acting are excellent the screenplay and set design are also excellent my favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the canteen i can see this movie any number of times and never get bored i give it 8 1 2 on 10
<START> as a former tv editor i can say this is as authentic as it gets it even led to letterman's producer thought to be a source resigning eventually in real life letterman was outraged ok so one goofy thing is it has him throwing at a tire swing on his estate total fabrication but the main information is hilariously true from the silly bidding war for letterman once he decided to leave nbc to leno's problems with an agent who was not ready for big time but who he let run the show almost to a disastrous exit out of his famed loyalty if any of you kids don't grasp the idea of why letterman is jealous to this day see this tape
<START> satisfying fantasy with ships sailing thru clouds with cannons evil plotters strange landscapes manipulations of time great sets void of reality maybe like never ending story or some merlin stuff if you like that you'll love it christine taylor is beautiful sword fighting is phoney music is delightful good wins out they kiss all is well and the cook is pleased
<START> d o a is a non thrilling thriller from directors rocky morton and annabel br br the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence br br are for example someone is shot near a window we then see from outside br br the building what looks like that person jumped i laughed my head off when this happened this movie tries hard but ultimately fails only watch this movie br br when you have no other choice br br my critique br br rating r br br rating reasons violence and language br br there was no rating reason available due to its age
<START> this is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times i'll go so far as to put it up there with ray and the aviator it is the story of a young bi racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing miss rachael aka nanny you will fall in love with nanny a woman who gives all of herself to those around her s brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same if i were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles i'd have to mention everyone in the entire cast br br the music in this film perfectly blends with the story almost dictates the way it goes and what's more this film is actually entertaining it won't bore you at all not even for a minute br br i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart very entertaining quality film
<START> i must admit that this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i thought dennis hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of if this is supposed to be funny then i gotta look around for a new sense of humor if you're thinking of buying this movie you'd better think again
<START> this was bad enough i really hope that there is no sequel maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility but no it really isn't br br there is really not at all special about this movie well the special effect were fairly good but nothing to write home about br br there were some hot babes in her especially elina madison and alexandra ford but nothing to see folks pg 13 definitely not an r that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual br br tame scare fare
<START> patsy kensit and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of art gallery related murders but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous the serial killer suddenly isn't important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife who's basically just a co worker of hers is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect tunnel vision is a really dull implausible and tension free aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sex thrillers like fatal attraction disclosure and basic instinct the characters are extremely one dimensional and pretty much every good cop bad cop clichÃ© is described in the script the struggling position of police women in a corps full of men the shoot first ask questions later mentality alcohol problems through stress etc etcÂ even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag yawn kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine the end twist is more or less interesting not at all original mind you but by then you stopped caring for the characters a long time already the scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ludicrously fake and clive directing is completely uninspired what a total waste of timeÂ
