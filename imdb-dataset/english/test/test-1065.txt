<START> i saw this film many years ago and absolutely hated it i could not wait for it to end and would have walked out but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder you know what i have never forgotten this film and more i would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years how many movies have i wept over and laughed over in the then forgotten as soon as i hit the street like you see i can't even think of one rarer are films like death in venice that enter your consciousness and work sea changes the french like to say film is an art and movies like this one prove they are right i give it 10 stars up from the 3 i gave it the night i saw it
<START> what's up with this movie does mr lyne and his writers think that a sado masochistic fling between two screwed up yuppies can carry a feature length movie maybe if it had some comedic elements which is doesn't at least intentionally or there were some additional dramatic elements which there are not or maybe if it was hardcore no it's simply the history of the affair a chronology of a bunch of r rated trysts ho hum who cares nine Â½ weeks deserves every razzie nomination it got it's a loser br br and by the way what's up with roger ebert and his rave review where was his head back in 1986
<START> the elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence after watching this documentary one can't help but take a step back and rethink their view on the existence of everything there is a large cast of scientists mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory it is continually brought into question as untested and possibly dead wrong the closest to proselytizing that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to sub atomic particles has never made an incorrect prediction not so with string theory no one is willing to say on camera that string theory is the truth and in so doing the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject
<START> back when i was working person i remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis i was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed i was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his i swear but i was thinking of this guy as i watched john malkovich and clint eastwood in their battle of wits br br in the line of fire casts clint eastwood as a veteran secret service agent who was on the job in dallas as a young man when john f kennedy was assassinated he's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles he's gotten back on the white house detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the secret service it's eastwood and partner dylan mcdermott who draw the case br br but the assassin is no ordinary crank case he's a professional at his job trained by and used by the central intelligence agency john malkovich earned a deserved academy award nomination for best supporting actor he lost that year to tommy lee jones for the fugitive and i'm not sure but that i thought malkovich was better br br oddly enough malkovich might have been better off but he saw eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal he calls eastwood throughout the film and taunts him and after a while what malkovich says and does causes clint to get real personal br br the presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations a guy like malkovich a professional with a real or imagined grudge is the most dangerous kind of foe br br others to note in the cast are fred dalton thompson as the white house chief of staff and would be president in real life rene russo as another agent who falls for the eastwood masculine charm john mahoney as the secret service head gary cole as the white house head secret service guy gregory alan williams as another agent and jim curley and sally hughes as the president and first lady br br but when malkovich is on he owns in the line of fire the climax with him and eastwood is unforgettable
<START> i saw this movie in santa monica on aug 23 and it has stayed with me i want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of harry's enigmatic eccentric life and also for showing the flaws and failings of nilsson the man thanks for showing the good and bad the ups and downs and for uncovering that amazing bbc footage the film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of music really well placed throughout the film i recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries especially if you are interested in harry nilsson or the music scene of the early 70's some reviewer at the ain't it cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the santa barbara film festival and i believe it the film is informative funny sad touching and full of awesome music it succeeds on all levels really really good
<START> after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent the boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void br br a scene where the two boys' dominate the of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all the only character that was worth watching was played by the castle's stephen curry his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs br br a word for this flic is boring save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it
<START> this film was one of the worst films i have ever seen this movie drags on and on and i almost turned it off but i gave it a shot i wasnt expecting anything great but i was expecting more than this good thing i work at a video store and saw this for free because i would'nt spend one dime on this movie i gave this movie a 2 only because i have seen worse if i were you i would stay away from this very far away
<START> this film had me spellbound this evening thanks to fox movie classics for showing it uninterrupted john voight this cast of little known black actresses and most of all the children made this a worthy way to spend a sunday evening how wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor as well as paul excellent portrayal of mad billy i can't see why anyone would say that hume cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent who would they have chosen the shrill character actor charles lane although his career is laudable an actor such as lane would have cheapened the role cronyn was an excellent choice for the part i will count this film as a true treasure to hold in memory
<START> this film simply has no redeeming features the story is incomprehensible and the script is gross sadistic and stupid the sex scenes are a joke as is the inevitable car chase the music is awful the acting is limited largely to growling and smirking a half star dud shame on directv for putting it on pay per view in a theater people might well have thrown soda at the screen
<START> before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all time greatest comedy team he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies many of which were parodies of major hollywood features most of laurel's films are only mildly funny and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is parodying fortunately and lampoons a movie which is still well known 'blood and starring rudolph valentino 'blood and was released only nine weeks before this parody giving you some idea of how quickly broncho billy's movies were ground out edited and distributed br br various sources including imdb state that stan laurel's character in this film is named with a final 'o' i've screened a print of and with the original titles in hobo type font so i report that laurel's role is actually cried vaseline with an 'e' but i agree that is funnier laurel copies the elaborate sideburns which valentino wore in 'blood and he should've made them longer and there's a parody of dressing scene from that movie which made female movie goers swoon in 1922 a named carmen in the original film is parodied here as caramel a girl i'd like to sink my teeth into br br this movie like the original apparently takes place in spain yet there's a prohibition gag laurel uses a distinctive hat tipping gesture here which could have become a trademark for him like hardy's distinctive necktie but i've never spotted it in any other laurel film there's some amusing dialogue vaseline tells the other to a bull for me ' when vaseline becomes a successful a lackey tells him 'the bull is without sir' which is funny but i was disappointed that laurel didn't reply what ' br br there's one funny moment here which almost certainly wasn't planned when vaseline shows up for the bullfighter auditions laurel into the and before you can say he tosses a bull over the fence where it lands with a thump near the other the bull is obviously a fake but the gag is funny anyway and aye there's a title card with a joke about 'throwing the the serendipitous moment occurs when laurel repeats the gag and vaseline slings a second bull over the fence this one lands on its butt and balances upright for just an instant before toppling very funny if somebody planned that gag in this quickie comedy i salute the unknown and the tech man who rigged the bull to land in that position more likely it happened by luck and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it in br br during the silent era whenever hollywood made a big budget feature film which was set anyplace where the people don't speak english it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local lingo then dissolve to a shot of the same text in english i was surprised that this low budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here we see a notice board outside the with a message in spanish then it dissolves to the same text in english unfortunately the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wasted br br the actresses in this movie are attractive including broncho billy's wife leona anderson and stan laurel's common law wife mae the latter briefly does a pretty dance mae had danced in stan's vaudeville act i was surprised to spot charlie chaplin's half brother wheeler in a brief role since chaplin had nothing to do with this movie in and laurel gives a funny performance that's quite unlike his later familiar stanley character but this film is much less funny than his brilliant work with oliver hardy my rating just 3 out of 10 trivia note twenty three years later in stan laurel's very last american film 'the 1945 he again played a spanish bullfighter with his spanish voice post dubbed coincidentally that film used stock footage from 'blood and not movie but the tyrone power remake and is funnier than 'the but not much
<START> imaginative quick paced satirical americans do but the brits do and they love to poke fun at themselves ahem unattractive teeth large lips nose common or snobby obsession with the inside jokes for the older folk in the audience lots of action for the kiddies subtle use of devices from other classic films watch for 'back to the future' jones ' and more also a nifty film gromit is a quiet but resourceful sidekick add brilliant voice work by bonham carter and fiennes is it true the best acting these days is being done in animation enjoy i saw it with the grandkids fun time for all
<START> i wish there was a category to place this in other than horror it simply isn't granted it has it's horrific moments however i don't feel that makes it a horror film i will give that this movie could have been better a million little things could have been changed to make it better br br that having been said i love this movie i'm often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say things aren't always what they seem sometimes 'evil' isn't br br barker was at a con i went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing it was very interesting many things he wished to put in the movie couldn't be and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost this was a chunk that helped shed light on boone and his girlfriend as well as some other details br br i know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the in the background however i always felt that gave the movie a more 'real' fleshed out feel i have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics because of this the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story a much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live br br despite all of the flaws this movie might have i believe it has a lot to offer the 'monsters' are wonderful very imaginative while the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines whenever i watch it i find something new keep and eye on chest toward the end at one point decker stabs him and shortly after boone falls on a card table he ends up with a card stuck to his chest this card stays there for a while even after lori pulls the knife out it stays there until boone casually removes it i love that that was a lovely little detail i thought br br basically what i want to say is that if you are looking for a horror movie don't watch this if you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up this is the movie for you this is a movie about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear
<START> the film starts well enough it is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father the young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard then we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug addled student researching the supernatural living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead she has no real friends was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no one else can see so yep life is grand things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mum's sister who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead hmm i wonder who the police's main suspect will be this is quickly followed by more deaths all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing could she be the culprit or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature clue if you think the former you've picked up the wrong movie from blockbuster go back and get the correct one short sighted gimp br br as i said i was all ready to fast forward to the good parts safe in the knowledge that i wasn't missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler but the first ten minutes grabbed me and i decided to give it a chance i was quite pleasantly surprised it certainly wasn't a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which i looked forward to finding the solution to alas 45 minutes in i realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library doing nothing we then get a cheap scare followed by quarter of an hour of about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend things only got worse from there as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another followed by an ending so anti climatic it's like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead pathetic br br if it was bad all the way through it would have been far easier to swallow the fact that it starts at a and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing it is heartbreaking how can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic i don't know and i don't particularly care i'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay then 5 minutes finishing the rest you tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here 3 10
<START> i have to ask myself do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it how can something so awful score this high my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids anything with an r in it until we were old enough i only remember two films that had them saying yech when they got home this one and catch 22 br br the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital rambling narratives and a pack of inner city people who look like rejects from a 1970s norman lear sitcom staging a protest the worst part is the murder mystery a crazy old guy doing god's work by killing doctors and others when he confesses scott and his girlfriend show little emotion they only care about him getting out of there where he will be safe and happy a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away oh my what a fun movie br br this movie didn't make me think chuckle or have any other feeling other than it must get better but it never does people wonder why it was a failure no wonder here i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good yech
<START> what a terrible movie this was i made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end the plot is nothing special and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot and or something that could said in a shorter amount of time the camera work is shaky and grainy it seemed mr milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn't flow the murder scenes were nothing special incredibly and laughably fake barely any gore as the title suggests this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie if that what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing and camera work usually i can make it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later bloodthirsty butchers however i can't i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this what i wouldn't do to gain it back take my suggestion and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep terrible
