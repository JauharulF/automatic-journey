<START> end of days starts off pretty well arnie plays a down and out cop a very similar character to riggs in lethal weapon and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment br br sadly it fails to deliver arnie is as good as we we have come to expect but as for gabriel byrne i expect him to chose his roles more carefully than this cast as the devil this is probably the weakest portrayal of the lord of darkness ever br br this movie gets a little too daft for me and the end sequence aside from being very weak is visually one of the worst i've seen in recent years cgi is have been better than this since the early nineties br br quite simply not good enough 4 10 watch it if you have too but don't expect too much cause it won't deliver
<START> the toxic avenger part ii starts with the startling revelation that after the toxic john who was apparently fired during production replaced with ron had rid his home town tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live this meant that toxie had no use as a superhero anymore now suffers from depression a feeling of utter uselessness just like directors lloyd kaufman michael herz should feel like after producing this toxie now works as a concierge at the centre for the blind' it's not long before trouble rears it's ugly head though an evil chemical producing company called apocalypse inc plans to take over tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of toxie after the evil chairman's rick collins first plan fails he bribes psychiatrist erika to tell him to go to japan see his father leaving his girlfriend claire phoebe his mother jessica dublin his home behind toxie heads for tokyo japan once there toxie sets about finding his father a woman named masami helps him in his quest meanwhile back in tromaville apocalypse inc move in for the kill without toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves toxie eventually finds big mac whom he has been lead to believe is his father however big mac is all part of apocalypse inc plans to destroy toxie once for all br br produced directed by lloyd kaufman michael herz this follow up to the successful the toxic avenger 1985 basically proves the first film was a complete fluke a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy outrageous violence so bad it's good film making the toxic avenger part ii is a load of crap in comparison the script by by kaufman phil gay terry with a load of 'additional material' credits does not contain one single funny moment during it's entire 102 uncut director's cut duration the visual gags are terrible toxie walking through tokyo with a wig glasses to blend in for instance or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it as he cooks toxie throws in a load of spaghetti a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a woman's nose sticks an antenna in her head a microphone in her mouth to which a japanese radio announcer talks into a bit where a japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish a bit where toxie grabs a swordfish head uses it as a weapon or the embarrassingly bad overacting stupid idiotic facial expressions a guy who literary has a fish for a head gets turned literary into sushi the awful comedy music sound effects the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing memorable the bad taste gags aren't there this time round the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing it just feels like a real step back from the original lets not forget this is troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing there are a few gory fights some serious gore violence at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version i saw crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood smashed faces intestines roses poked in someones eyes thorns wrapped around their throat ripped off ears severed arms a very graphic gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces unfortunately the special effects by aren't particularly convincing come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes the acting is of embarrassing proportions as i've already mentioned action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end a few unexciting lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart comedy wise this is very unfunny in fact the toxic avenger part ii sucks on all levels really to top it all off it's atrociously made as well most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner continuity is none existent cinematography is basic point shoot the special effects are anything but one or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain simple do yourself a favour watch the original again instead
<START> this 8 minute gem is not only timeless but it is a cartoon milestone it is third cartoon and one of his best ones too it is a cartoon milestone because it was the first one with sound and my goodness even after 70 years it is ever so good and gives real additional weight to the narrative the black and white animation is excellent and the character features are convincing enough the music is wonderful i love the soundtrack it does add to the fun the cartoon has no matter how thin the story sometimes is and the cartoon is funny so many memorable moments like the cow's teeth being used as an xylophone and its udder as a bagpipe the characters are also engaging mickey and minnie two landmark disney characters are well voiced by walt disney and pete serves well as the villain of the piece all in all steamboat willie is just a timeless gem that everybody should see at least once 10 10 bethany cox
<START> i completely understand why this movie was made silence of the lambs was an incredible film a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump factor br br what i don't understand is why this movie was made and why anthony hopkins agreed to reprise his role as hannibal the cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film br br there's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could but for those of you who prefer to waste your money don't read on the film is absolutely horrible it's so bad that the transition from jodie foster to julianne moore becomes a non issue br br the only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film because up until that point it's quite an interesting thriller the between moore and hopkins is comparable to hopkins and foster and the performances by the other characters are pretty good but literally at the two hour mark the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy d grade horror flick it's sick and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time and threw together an ending in one day of filming br br initial buzz over the thomas harris' book's unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director ridley scott to order a re write and honestly having seen the film and read the book's finale i don't know which is worse br br please don't waste your money or time on this film unless you're prepared to leave exactly at the two hour point because that's the only way you'll feel satisfied about the saga of clarice starling and hannibal lecter continuing the mystery that made the first film and the wait for this one so great
<START> ok who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all slit their throats this film was absolute and utter filth what the heck was up with the weird old bags eyes seriously was she on some sort of horrible drug and then she like just thought she could control people she was running around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what do i have a booger hanging out of my nose what are you staring at are you like the sea witch or something all and all though i thought the graphics were top notch old chap for that alone i would give it a ten but just cover your ears when you are watching it the pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall off who knows you might even get a knot in your small intestine you better watch out fools
<START> i have always liked this film and i'm glad it's available finally on dvd so more viewers can see what i have been telling them all these years story is about a high school virgin named gary lawrence who works at a pizza place as a delivery boy and he hangs out with his friends david joe and rick steve gary notices karen diane franklin who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love that night at a party he see's rick with karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but doesn't tell anyone of his true feelings br br spoiler alert br br rick asks gary if he can borrow his grandmothers vacant home but gary makes up an excuse so that rick can't get karen alone but one night rick brags to gary that he nailed her at the football field and gary becomes enraged a few days later in the school library gary see's rick and karen arguing and he asks karen what is wrong she tells him that she's pregnant and that rick has dumped her gary helps her by taking her to his grandmothers home and paying for her abortion finally gary tells karen how he really feels about her and she seems receptive to his feelings but later at her birthday party he walks in on karen and rick together again gary drives off without the girl this film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is no matter how nice you are you don't necessarily get the girl br br this film was directed by boaz davidson who would go on to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things right with this movie first he made sure that there was plenty of gratuitous nudity so that this was marketable to the young males that usually go to these films secondly he had the film end with young gary without karen and i think the males in the audience can relate to being screwed over no matter how hard you try and win a girls heart yes this film is silly and exploitive but it is funny and sexy actress louisa moritz almost steals the film as the sexy carmela moritz was always a popular b level actress and you might remember her in one flew over the cuckoo's nest like fast times at ridgemont high this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is going on in the story but at the heart of this film is two very good performances by and franklin there is nudity required by franklin but she still conveys the sorrow of a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time she's always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film but this is still story and you can't help but feel for this guy when the film ends it's his performance that stays with you it's a solid job of acting that makes this more than just a teen sex comedy even with the silly scenarios of teens trying to have sex this film still manages to achieve what it wants underrated comedy hits the bullseye
<START> the creative team behind evan almighty really should have been able to make a better film starring one of america's favourite and helmed by ace ventura pet detective director tom shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides hell even steve oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious barnyard and attains a writing credit here has done better work the fact of the matter is that evan almighty isn't the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's bruce almighty that picture had jim carrey in the lead and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material i've heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else but the actor declined he saw no other places for his character to venture thus shadyac moved over to carell who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business and so it's him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres the story see's evan baxter steve carell having been elected as a congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so evan can find success with his job his wife lauren graham and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards evan who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes however things start to go belly up fairly fast god morgan freeman appears to evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an ark initially ignoring the encounter evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow politician john goodman anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie ace ventura liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures but all of those projects have one thing in and thats jim carrey's presence shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without carrey at the helm he's worked with robin williams eddie murphy and now steve carell but still only carrey seems to meld successfully with shadyac carell after the disappointing box office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again and with carrey now doing more serious projects shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast carell himself is fairly dull here whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie despite being quite amusing deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot i expect after bruce box office draw it was universal studios themselves but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud and thats exactly the case with evan almighty lauren graham isn't any great shakes as evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece indeed the most consistent source of laughter is evan's secretary wanda sykes and creep co worker jonah hill both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project writing has been worse barnyard but also better ace ventura when nature calls than his work on this production his script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough the film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than evan whole 95 minute run with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture i don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question there's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile a line that evan almighty is always on the wrong side off maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy
<START> stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier and of course the experiments went terribly wrong burdening us with a half man half mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he's upset lance henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project but he returns bringing the whole family with him when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree mind ripper certainly is a watchable horror movie but it's very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame clichÃ© you can think off including the estranged father rebellious teenage son sub plot yawn the characters are like wooden puppets the dumbest things are being said and done and there's a completely pointless dream sequence coming from the monster there's a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert locations are effectively eerie lance henriksen is adequate as always even though this is yet another inferior production he stars and giovanni ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in for some reason this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as the hills have eyes part 3 is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert is it because wes craven was once again involved as a producer this time or maybe it's because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael berryman in the 1977 original who knows who cares wes craven probably financed this project because his son co wrote the script and it's always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are not recommended
<START> after i couldn't ignore the hype about the show i started watching season one and it struck me as really good and i was hooked for about 5 episodes then it started to spiral downwards why first ethan is scripted to act as a complete idiot confirming that very obviously by spewing out semi random stuff in great expectations of it somehow becoming the next best joke br br jaime pressly's got stunning looks but if she thinks stretching lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange grimaces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious she's way off track maybe she thought her character would be too flat faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy but made a flood of colors overkill of spices and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes ears and intellect br br i really really wanted to love this show like i said the premise is great comes from the same shelf as the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain and jason lee is doing a pretty good job here along with some of the other actors but there is no way no how i would get in' and forget that this is just a show because pressly's and surreal extreme characters abruptly wake me when they show up it's worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn't a 70 something part series and if they didn't get that much screen time
<START> 'toy soldiers' is the story of five misfits boys most being sean astin wil wheaton and kieth coogan attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the american government imprisons the leader's father lou jr plays the headmaster of the school a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline br br 'toy soldiers' is a funny and pretty cool action and certainly the better of hostage crisis at school movies i think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast but also the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should trapped inside the boarding school and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school they're actually pretty clever about it too br br i was surprised that it was a pretty good movie it keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that astin and jr give good performances br br i too agree that this is an underrated action movie
<START> now let me see if i have this correct a lunatic serial killer is going around murdering estate agents okay what's wrong with that scenario i can live with that br br what next a slasher with tax inspectors butchered traffic wardens sliced to death are we supposed to feel any sympathy for empty headed and shallow money obsessed property people er no br br sadly joking aside it's just not a very well made film with poor acting and crude effects the climatic scene is particularly silly you can almost see the director shouting 'action' to the stuntman as he falls through the glass of the window br br as another reviewer quite rightly said after starring in 'the fog ' this was the nadir of adrienne barbeau's career therefore i was happy to see that she had it by becoming the voice of catwoman in the batman animated series while watching the extras on the live action catwoman film nb not quite the awful film it's made out to be by the way br br this however is a bad film think a poor episode of 'kojak' or 'streets of san francisco ' and you will get an idea of what is on offer here
<START> this review contains a spoiler br br the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts he falls for the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the people's hero at the end of the film this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality good for kids under 14 the military errors in this film is comical i remember during my three years in the military us privates were not required to salute or call nco's sir the film does this in various spots the colonel's hair is way too long on the ears the master moustache was against military protocol in length on the post the colonel was the only officer around not one other officer was shown walking around the post you had idiot ninjas swords against troops with m rather poorly made br br folks this filmed reeked michael dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous avoid this film
<START> i have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things br br 1 what i'll call the stupid victim syndrome if you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun shoot him please if you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back shoot him please br br 2 when you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun your first instinct is to squeeze this is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you don't put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire ask any hunter or infantryman if you are electrocuted your muscles should also contract making you squeeze your finger br br 3 it's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people one of them a doctor not noticing that you aren't dead even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier br br 4 technically the killer did kill one of his victims the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote if you poison someone that is murder br br 5 what was adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn yes the doctor needed to be there but what was adam's crime maybe i just missed something br br other than those things i would have given this movie a higher grade the plot was pretty good and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive i can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor's part the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick the cinematography and soundtrack were very good but the ending seemed contrived and just didn't work for me thank goodness i didn't have to pay to see this or i would have demanded a refund
<START> a bit too much machismo for me the cast was beautiful lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes the locale was beautiful with skies and water it just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building could attract so many beautiful vulnerable women only in the mediterranean i guess certainly in no world i am familiar with the macho men were really obnoxious and i found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long the screenplay cinematography directing etc was set up to deliver a class b film the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts it was aesthetically nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film
<START> i saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header alongside dorm daze and going greek obviously we weren't going for quality but for air headed entertainment and gross out gags generally we got what we came for but wild roomies really stood out for being awful br br first impression first the cover the norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly crazy roomies in the background brings up pictures of drunken semi naked teenagers doing bunches of funny stuff stuff doesn't it the crazy roomies on the cover were not even featured in the picture and the funny stuff you assume they'll be doing absent as well br br this movie was labeled comedy which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny relationship drama would be more accurate br br put shortly the movie is about a young couple inheriting a swanky house in la and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet these roommates eventually put both the young couple's patience and relationship to the test because they're so wild problem is they're not and here lies the problem of this movie the protagonist couple are so anal retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy you'll find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies halfway through the movie add mediocre acting lame dialogue and boring direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseen br br see something else
