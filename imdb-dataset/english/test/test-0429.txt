<START> pharaoh's army defies formula instead of selling out for cliches and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best i've ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you like this film try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film wicked spring as well br br pharaoh simply tells the true story of a small expedition team of union men who ride into a confederate farm to take provisions but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men tensions and relationships are made and broken nothing happens the way hollywood would write it this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional but often doesn't feel like you're watching a movie more along the lines of hearing a story br br the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role he transforms but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to patricia clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in she shares an interesting chemistry with cooper's character and where she's the more severe of the characters is still as easy to identify with the rest of the cast is quite capable and fill their roles in well br br the art design and the set are wonderful and personally i love the cinematography it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin like tint but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting they seem to have used natural lighting but whatever they used works beautifully everything looks like it belongs where it is it feels period something i find rare in american period films the actors act 19th century not like 20th century people in old clothes br br above all this film is very personal i think that as an indie it can afford it the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is it doesn't fail in getting it's point across and it gets it's point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days it's brave it relies on it's characters a fantastic script human emotion and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasn't all cgi big stars and hoop skirts
<START> i've never understood this type of spoof movies you get some serious semi serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart jokes and such we've seen it many many times and it's never really been funny it's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand in my opinion this seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre though i honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of spy hard or hot shots this movie as is clearly understood simply from the title concentrates on making childish fun of pulp fiction that's the main reason i decided to watch it as i found that film to be overly indulgent of tarantino's sick mind and powerfully overrated i had hoped for one or two good jokes making fun of the overly violent and pointless type of movie that pulp fiction was in every aspect in my anything but humble opinion i was sorely disappointed the plot is pretty much a rip off of tarantino's film with a few scenes spoofing other often better films in the same childish and humorless fashion the pacing is poor and often you'll sit there being able to guess the outcome of every scene predicting every joke often thinking of a better one at the spot bored out of your mind the acting is bad the characters are clichÃ©s and stereotypes and are intentionally paper thin in order to make fun of the characters they're based on problem is it doesn't work it just makes the movie that much harder to sit through the humor is juvenile and lame the only positive thing i can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like the film is an awful waste of the actual real actors involved possibly slightly entertaining to fans of the typical spoof movies of the same kind i recommend this only to people who truly loathed pulp fiction or fans of the zucker parody films everyone else avoid 1 10
<START> i haven't reviewed on imdb before but this documentary is so overrated that i felt compelled to vent i wouldn't have even finished watching if i hadn't been a guest at someone's house the film was poor on many levels first video footage was contrived the more i watched the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction br br second the others in the film with the exception of parents and the airline pilot were just as contrived and corny as he was god they seemed artificial br br third mission to protect the bears doesn't even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence i believe that really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates his efforts were misguided sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help br br fourth the film's entertainment value wasn't half that of other wildlife films such as march of the penguins and winged migration the filmmakers in my opinion did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching br br as a person who loves alaska bears and other wildlife i would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our hopefully their efforts will be less people centered
<START> breaker breaker has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master talk about juggling two disparate careers he gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother michael and then when the young man doesn't show up chuck goes looking for him br br what young has got himself into is a speed trap run by judge george murdock who comes from the roy bean school of jurisprudence of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble the call goes out over the cb for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy this speed trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal br br chuck's of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one he's got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the academy won't be looking at this gobbler george murdock is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe br br this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris
<START> possible spoilers br br i thought pitch black to be quite enjoyable with some nice effects i liked the larger beasts although they aren't a patch on the aliens from the alien series it had quite a good atmosphere which i felt vin diesel helped contribute toward br br one thing which kind of stumped me was how it if the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain br br i liked the fact that fry died at the end it reminded me of the new hollywood films of the 1970s with the main heroine not making it to the end
<START> alright so not every australian movie is all that good yes maybe there have actually been very few with much merit take away however is an absolute bomb qualifying as one of the worst movies i've ever seen i wanted to like it i figured i'd give it a fair go i've even met one of the screen writers dave o'neil so i feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review but the plot is fairly thin i won't bother relating it read the synopsis which i can forgive there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes unfortunately take jokes cover its plot up like a 2 prostitute's skirt probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue take away goes down like a week old dim sim you might understand that joke if you see the film but the joke's not worth it
<START> okay people i have to agree with almost everyone else's reviews here the characters are stupid they're all stereotypical and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny br br don't even get me started on jamie lynn's role as zoey zoey is a pretty popular tan blonde young teen who everyone just loves she has a rebellious great personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is most annoying of all her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious omg br br take for example the first episode the moment she steps onto the huge campus everyone seems to love her the boys want to ask her out the girls want to be her friend etc thinking she's all that the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention she is the so called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team confident and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face oh boo hoo br br my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show lauren or something who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoey br br and zoey doesn't even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and doesn't show the least bit regret in doing so br br zoey is always the best br br desiging professional t shirts and which become a big hit br br coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson br br flawless grades br br taking the blame for stuff that wasn't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy br br coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv the list goes on and on br br ugh she has no acting talent she's always the perfect person she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and ugh can't stand her br br not only that but everyone in the show always has great clothes even the nerd her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty freaking decent br br no one cares if everyone at loves you zoey and would do anything for you even if it meant giving their right arm br br but regardless of these cardboard characters the plots are creative not everyday things they're interesting and amusing the humor is usually good natured and fun but the characters are so paper flat that it's hard to enjoy it br br this show would be really good if dan put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted because they are so typical so boring that's it's lame and stupid br br point no one's the least bit overweight everyone has stylish clothes zoey is the definition of mary sue the story lines are well thought out and the humor is laughable but again i want to emphasize that the characters taint the show watch the show if you must but don't say i didn't warn you if your eyes start to bleed
<START> this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm we had never seen the film even though we have seen most of the films of barbara stanwyck this comedy made us laugh so much that at times we had to restrain ourselves in order to hear the dialog br br this is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations especially around christmas it would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go the movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a dvd or a vhs tape br br christmas in connecticut was directed with great panache by peter godfrey based on a story by aileen hamilton br br the best thing in the movie is the pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan barbara stanwyck always played strong willed women obviously this was a change of pace for her in this film as well as lady eve ms stanwyck displays a knack for comedy she and mr morgan who played in a lot of musical comedies make a winning combination br br there are no weak performances in the film sydney greenstreet an actor notorious for playing is a delight to watch as the rich and fat alexander yardley the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it reginald gardiner an accomplished english actor adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals br br s z is another source of continuous mirth he plays the hungarian chef felix who has a hard time with his own version of the english language also una o'connor makes a perfect norah the housekeeper in the sloan perfect connecticut farm br br in reading other comments in this forum it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people after all color was not widely used in the 40s and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because what would be accomplished in them br br this film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at christmas time because total merriment is assured watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see christmas in connecticut every year
<START> the lone ranger tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason that is until the lone ranger discovers from a conversation with the indian chief that each man possessed a medallion the five given by to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold can the lone ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the before the hooded raiders get their hands on it is there really a lost city of gold somewhere upon native land br br watching this i kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed really familiar until eventually i realized i had seen this exact same movie when i was but a little kid suddenly the memories flooded back and i remembered having quite a fun time as a child enjoying this one with a bunch of my friends as an adult though the plot is somewhat predictable but you know this while not quite in the same league as the 1956 film remains a lot of fun to watch clayton moore is perfect as the lone ranger and jay as tonto steals a lot of this movie as he's probably in more action scenes than even the lone ranger there's some very familiar faces on hand here including douglas kennedy as ross brady of the hooded raiders gang charles watts as a bigoted sheriff and ralph moody as a kindly padre
<START> for the first time in reviewing films i found myself immediately uninterested in this story i don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters but it felt bland overused and completely unoriginal within the first thirty minutes i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story i felt as if i had seen this structure before and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me after thinking that it may just be my mood i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning but the same feeling persisted i just didn't care that is not a good sign the characters were bland when i say bland i literally mean that by watching them develop you will never have any flavor hit your palate the story seemed recycled nearly to the point of plagiarism now i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story but she added nothing fresh to the perspective the casting was horrid the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them nor the characters and the stories were vague and sloppy you knew nothing about anyone or anything and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters we instead found ourselves with drugs minor sex and money pushed into our faces these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time yet somehow could not be creatively captured by wayne br br what immediately pulled me away from this story it was mainly the characters i have seen most of brad work and honestly he needs to redefine himself director larry clark has defined him and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character within the first twenty minutes of screen time i was bored i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why it was spectacular nor impressive just repetitive he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role instead of just blandly playing this random socialite without a strong character the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film while i am on the subject Â nobody showcased the best of their abilities what is going on with dominique swain outside of lolita i don't believe she has really emerged as an actress and following up with roles such as cat storm doesn't help bijou phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting she was lost rambling here and there and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act melanie griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project br br my biggest problem outside of the acting was the pacing of this film nothing and this is hard for me to say but nothing gelled together there were so many sub stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed the robberies the teenage angst and woe the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is the random kids in the hall guy and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together with this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape family structures were never defined characters were never given any emotion and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers wayne did not complete the task at hand br br while i hate to put the entire burden on the director with this film i am left with little choice with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any good behind tart this was a film i had heard nothing about and after viewing it i can see why all wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film tart it is hard for me to say this but wayne ruined this film while i don't believe there was much to fully take from the story any remaining elements of excitement were drained as wayne took the helm while most of the time you can credit some of the story perhaps strong acting or even the music in tart you can credit nothing from the opening sequence until the end i felt like i was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal no consistency no strength br br overall this film is a waste of your time if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society you will not find it in this film while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show the final product seems like it was edited on an etch a sketch it was an embarrassing film to sit through and encourage nobody to pick it up wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life avoid at all costs br br grade out of
<START> while i thought this was a good film about jfk jr it was a little hard to follow the timeline it jumped around quite a bit without ever mentioning what year they were in otherwise not great acting and not really a great film but it was nice to learn a little more about who jfk jr was
<START> i went through the highs i went through the lows cried laughed puked my ever loving guts out but through it all i was made whole i became a better person for having sat through this experience in self imposed degradation it's not every day we can say that we have lived through the worst and come out the other side with something closely resembling our sanity whole and intact friends neighbors unite and be as one now go out and find this film and languish in its place it high on the and kiss its polystyrene box take it to bed take it out with you when you go shopping or have blind dates with strange people they will appreciate you all the better for your sublime and uniquely schizophrenic slant on cinema and then they will throw their beverage of choice in your face but you will have the last laugh i ran for governor with this little beauty under my belt and you can too it is a treat worth having again and again
<START> on a routine mission in iraq a group of delta soldiers recover a computer hard drive from an training camp detailing the location of weapons specialist dr walsh after witnessing the termination of his top secret weapons development program dr walsh finds an alternative funding source and sets up a new research facility deep in the notorious forest in where he is developing weapons and selling them to rebels the team of deltas is sent on a black ops mission to retrieve the doctor and his technology before the russians find him and his lab what the delta team soon discover is that the doctors latest weapons is a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to develop a taste for human flesh i found this movie to be much better than what i was expecting there is lots of action and lots of blood its more or less what you would expect from a creature feature the acting isn't great but its passable i have certainly seen worse overall its an enjoyable movie for what it is a good popcorn movie
<START> it's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and i agree br br if mom and daughter were really that sharp witted they should be queen and princess of the universe not kicking around in some little town br br i've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts i flip the channel br br i watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed for the better i'd hoped but nope same old we're so clever with our references to pop culture that i nearly barfed br br long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be up and getting sick of the regurgitated that never stops
<START> this is probably wayne's poorest movie at least the poorest in which he had a starring role it's just incredibly bad the editing is especially awful it really appears that the editor if there was one literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together the opening has to be seen to be believed john wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned i know there are b films but are there h films if so this one's an example and i say this as a devoted fan
