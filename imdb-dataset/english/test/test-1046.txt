<START> this movie was a waste of the celluloid it was printed on it is a disastrous scene much like a particularly gruesome train wreck br br watching this is like trying to explain the meaning of life the main plot point is that the character played by steve guttenberg is a party animal who's not supposed to gamble because that would violate his parole the kids he befriends refuse to play with him as coach for a while because he gambles but a few minutes later after they've won the championship a large sum of money saves their shelter and where did they get the money gambling add this to the creepy scenes at the funeral home why exactly are there bedrooms in a funeral home and the useless peripheral character
<START> i caught this little gem totally by accident back in 1980 or i was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci fi movies the theatre was packed full and with no warning they showed a bunch of sci fi short spoofs to get us in the mood most were somewhat amusing but this came on and within seconds the audience was in hysterics the biggest laugh came when they showed princess having huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head she looks at the camera gives a grim smile and nods that made it even funnier you gotta see played by what looks like a muppet it was extremely silly and stupid but i couldn't stop laughing most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter also if you know star wars pretty well it's even funnier they deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue this really works with an audience a definite 10
<START> that distinction has to go to the dungeon of harrow at least ed wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious star power of bela vampira tor johnson and lyle talbot the dungeon of harrow has no redeeming qualities whatsoever what could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony perhaps in the style of the island of dr moreau or mysterious island is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity the special effects which took place in someone's bathtub further doom this film to the dung heap even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a victorian interpretation of the bible the fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat fallon and his lady cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the castle de sade doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty it is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film no wonder talent begets talent lack of talent begets oblivion which is where this film should find its deplorable end
<START> i watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was deceived i am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to dvd horror movies once in a blue moon 1 will be ok it started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was ok because i like storms and it set a nice mood then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner encountering bizarre people the rest got weird and then got confusing i did watch it til the end but was even more confused when it ended so badly i had higher hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for tv
<START> punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema shot in the southern br br california desert using his patent faux documentary style br br creates a film like no other he follows two groups of prisoners one br br pre sentenced the other post sentenced throughout the picture after br br they're tried by a military tribunal they have the choice of either br br serving out a prison sentence or they can participate in punishment br br park a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but the br br clothes on their backs whilst being hunted down by local law br br enforcement officers who use the park as a live action training br br ground i can't say enough about this movie sometimes it feels as if br br you're watching a real documentary this is one of peter most br br accessible films i advise you to look out for it you wont regret it br br highly recommended br br a br br
<START> an object lesson in how to make a bad movie which masquerades as horror without going in too close i would imagine this is the results of a bunch of film school students all adding bits to the story and then actually acting in it its like a film workshop of some kind and its a film badly in need of an editor in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes the director of this garbage probably had more money than sense consider the number of submitted scripts or even unreleased films which would have benefited from this the so called granny who was killing people in some pretty stupid ways looked like christopher lloyd in back to the future or maybe the musicians johnny winter edgar winter it starts off with 20 minutes of crass boring nonsense spouted out by the students something about paranoia giving this rubbish 1 is because it can't get any less it has not one single redeeming feature and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy fooling about she has to actually taste the red stuff before she knows its not tomato ketchup its an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
<START> for years i've been a big fan of park's work and old boy is one of my all times favorite br br with lots of expectation i rented this movie only to find the worst movie i've watched in awhile it's not a proper horror movie there's no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame that i didn't know whether to laugh or cry br br i introduced my younger brother to chan wook park and what a disappointment he got from this for me an idol has fallen br br if you loved movies like old boy the mr lady vengeance or even his short films on three extremes don't waste your time the film's not worth it
<START> i knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going but when i saw the beginning credits i said oh my god bruce walter koenig from star trek gil gerard from buck rogers and he's almost unrecognizable then i saw john callahan who used to star on my favorite soap all my childen put on a few pounds but he can still act then there was veronica hamill too bad i didn't sick around to see her in the film i bailed out 20 minutes into he film it was that bad never did see william katt from perry mason and the american hero br br all these stars and one lousy film i hope hey got their paycheck br br bad bad bad
<START> not having seen the 1936 version of this story i cannot offer any comparison there i can however state that stephen sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius only sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter if anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is they should see this and dr strangelove as well when mrs lovett goes from having the worst pies in london to a booming business with high acclaim we aren't talking soylent green but the ingredients are similar particularly brilliant is the song where mrs lovett pitches her idea to mr todd even in the introductory number the line they went to their maker impeccably shaved gives a great indication of the premise the drama and the comedy to come outstanding
<START> first let me make it clear that i'm a big fan of bad sci fi especially when it involves gigantic city stomping monsters but this one is so fantastically lame that i can't even like it for being bad they apparently didn't shave enough money off the budget by skimping on the props the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized novelty pencil available at spencer's gifts for about fifteen bucks they also decided not to outlay for concept or plot the monster does look okay in my opinion but it doesn't have enough interaction with the backgrounds i e not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre the general rule of giant monster movies is if you don't have a lot of fake looking buildings to smash then you'd better have another fake looking monster to wrestle with this movie has neither i can't make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending but suffice to say the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it just don't hold water not even as well as most of these movies skip it
<START> i consider this a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward a vietnam survivor tells his harrowing tale and some of the story is on location reviewers sometimes even claim that herzog's presence in the film is minimal but how wrong they are we know that all documentaries are to some extent and this one has herzog's subtle hand all over it most notably in the stunning music the unbelievably expert selection of archival footage and the management of cascading images the evocative power of this film is astounding starting with its title the opening title card from the book of revelation and the initial voice over this is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder not a simple commodity that is gulped down with one's favorite beverage on the way to the evening news this is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime
<START> don't torture a duckling is one of fulci's earlier and honestly in terms of story line better films and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for this is still a very unique and enjoyable film br br the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force a small time reporter a beautiful and rich ex drug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protÃ©gÃ© a mentally handicapped and a deaf mute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed br br don't torture a duckling is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both it is more of an old fashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci's later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallo murder mystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulci's non splatter films but don't despair don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting but if that type of material doesn't bother you then definitely give this one a look 8 5 10
<START> the old man mouse in this cartoon would have you believe that all men are created equally evil so if we have to kill men in order to stop hitler we are just as bad as hitler was killing the jews well i don't buy it mr mouse but i guess it paints a pretty picture and makes a cute cartoon but it wasn't the reality then and it ain't reality now
<START> the story is disjointed and poorly written we are given threads and a possible hook in act one only to see it vanish had the writer bothered reading his work carefully it wold have been apparent that character's initial problem and meeting with the 'bad' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem br br the problem goes nowhere the relationship goes nowhere and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships no one digs anyone and no one is appealing the writing and directing is laughable you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement there is none the writer director is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie from simple errors such as ' they took ' in japan in 2007 to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism this movie is an insult you cannot make them much worse br br and by on the talent list the producers thought they'd have some success he is hardly acting asia certainly is and the result is some heroin chic panto br br give it a big miss
<START> primary plot primary direction poor interpretation
