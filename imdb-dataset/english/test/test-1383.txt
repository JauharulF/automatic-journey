<START> if you are a fan of slap stick that has terrible writing awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you br br there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks in a brief synopsis people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars and yes they are all apparently super heroes as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80 mph survive numerous car crashes and endless instances of outright cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics br br if you are a teen or dont want to think for a movie this one is for you not one actor outside of lovitz is believeable at all lovitz saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit br br 2 10 save yourself the 2 hours of pain and 4
<START> yes it is a bit cheesy but it's suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorites there are some excellent actors in the film and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters it's interesting to see david soul in a 'bad guy' role i thought he was quite believable and rather chilling as the ever more paranoid co robert conrad is a long time favorite i think he brings his character to life very well and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his i've watched movies or tv br br i watch this movie every so often but our tape a vhs tv copy i got is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after but i'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version i'll keep hoping
<START> i found this little gem as an extra feature on my dvd of vampyr der des allen grey and didn't expect all that much from it it looked like it might be an interesting little short though so i turned it on br br i am so glad that i did it was really incredible despite having been made more than 70 years ago the animation was in my view better than some of that done today with all the computer effects and experience available now br br the story is quite simple a newly put together toy dog hears its owner's laments about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find her one in the process it runs into a underworld with all sort of nefarious creatures and toys overseen by none other than the devil himself who all want the dog's orange for themselves as well br br this film precedes but reminds me a lot of mad monster party 1969 jules bass a movie which i have always really enjoyed and to a lesser extent some of tim burton's animated works the nightmare before christmas 1993 henry selick and corpse bride 2005 tim burton fans of any of these movies will i am sure also love the mascot br br overall an incredible piece of short animation which is well worth watching
<START> i can't believe i actually bought this movie it sucks where i live mexican movies mexican movies are never advertised or even available you can't find them in the regular rental places so i had to buy it i really like mexican movies they bring me closer to my roots and my people and they are way different that what your normally used to but this one was soo predictable your could guess what was going to happen i'ts not a horrible movie it just wasn't worth what i paid for it jaja but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah u should watch it but if you love mexican movies and love theater itself then don't watch it it'll be painful lol
<START> do yourself a favor and stay away from this film minus 50 billion out of 10 if you want hard boiled action don t rent it if you want a good independent film look elsewhere br br i never thought i d see burt reynolds in such a crappy movie it has the thinnest plot line ever van damm flicks should win an academy compared to this one br br rob lowe once again prove why he is not the hottest actor in the world even hasselhoff would have made a better drug addict than him i do not want to bore you with more facts about this crappy movie except to say that you are better off renting anything by hulk hogan or dolph this should prove my point if you get my drift br br
<START> hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble don't they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day
<START> well it is about 1 000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets black men are still calling each other brothers and getting high stoned fighting etc common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they're from baywatch share close quarters with the captian and crew crippled people still require wheelchairs to move no fancy cures implants or robotic legs dracula still looks and acts gay need i go on in short this move was shot on a typical sci fi set low budget props actors and no real special effects to speak of the beginning the middle and the ending was pathetic i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for
<START> while this is horribly dated i must insist please no remake frankly it just won't help as there's nothing which could be added or changed to make this cinematically better br br the novel upon which this is based was atmospheric well written truly spooky work but on film it just doesn't translate most of king's written masterpieces fail to translate to film i'm not sure why this is but when you view this work if you view it you are likely to see just what i mean br br the book it's wonderful it's not a masterpiece but it's more than just entertaining br br the movie do something else you can thank me later br br it rates a 3 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> my grandad gave me this dvd with friends like these the front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it what a bloody mistake br br basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends br br the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a clone in his fridge and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm br br the dvd case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be or entertained the film should be rated 12 for slight scares and the swear word bloody br br all in all this film is utter shite don't go near it
<START> this short film doesn't get there cliche' and not very funny attempt at dark humor humor isn't funny enough to get you interested and the protagonist isn't likeable so you really don't care about what happens anyway producer spent some money on this flop and it shows in the production value which is the only saving grace
<START> well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times no happy endings super heroes or miracles here just down to earth fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism and what ifs kudos to percival and for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by percival films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there if every peace loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not thrive this movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists even with good intelligence even though the film is a bit propagandist against islam the use of a muslim police officer as a main character i believe it was entirely realistic there was meant to be shock value in the bombing incident as a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this they showed full nudity of women being post attack it didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought i e we are not in control of everything in a situation like this although this took place in london with the usual high level british acting it makes a statement for any part of the world great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions and this movie is very very worthy of viewing
<START> this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i have seen a lot of movies the unbelievable twist the movie makes going from an extremely bad alien lifeforms inhabit earth movie with sickening bad acting to a film that tries to spread an judgement day is at hand seek jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell message left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes even religious christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this i didn't know what to do with myself when i watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by 7 year olds simply disgusting i am not a christian nor very religious but if i had been i would no longer be afraid of hell rich has shown be something much much worse
<START> this is what confuses me about critics and their opinion i usually do take in what the critics say about a film on most occasions before i see a movie br br however i saw this one without knowing anything about it mainly because of the cast kevin spacey and don cheadle are two of the most acclaimed and in my opinion best actors alive and ryan gosling is on a fast escalating journey up there as well his reality and humanity which he exudes in most of his portrayals makes the audience truly believe in the character and whats happening to him he's really my favourite actor of my generation i've always found jena malone pretty cute ever since donnie darko and if she chooses to keep doing similar roles then heck i ain't complaining br br back to my point this movie really moved me i believed it the acting was top class as one would expect the actually movie left the audience with the ultimate aim of a good movie reflection and pondering which ensues after the final credits roll i think i must watch it again to decipher how this movie was critically mauled i know that their reviews must be taken with a pinch of salt at least i know now
<START> the kite runner is one of those modern epics that one is occasionally graced with spanning two continents multiple family generations and many decades this film touches on a myriad of items including friendship love loss and ultimately redemption br br it's prime mover is young amir a native afghan boy who often plays with the hired help mainly young hassan ahmad khan a boy who's family is supposedly inferior to the ruling afghans but the two form a bond of friendship based on education amir teaches hassan to read closeness in house and of course kite flying br br but bad times are on the way for the city of kabul the communists are invading and amir and hassan have separated due to an impossibly brutal act of prejudice by an afghan boy against hassan the two may never see each other again br br father races to get himself and his son out of afghanistan eventually finding their way to america here the two set up a gas station and live hand to mouth by selling at niche markets and as father gradually becomes ill a new revelation will strike to the heart of amir one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved kabul br br a study of friendship war and reconciliation the kite runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema the story is never inappropriately spoken in english whenever we're in a foreign country and only broken english whenever we're in america this was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism br br the acting was on par with the best you'll see too particular note must be made of who plays baba ailing father and strong patriarch also lead as the older amir is played well especially when returning to kabul to find it in ruin quite the contrast from when he'd left br br the cinematography of afghanistan during escape and ultimate return are nothing short of breathtaking with snow capped peaks that will cause your mouth to slacken i'm not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the film but wherever it was i want to go there and film it myself but it isn't the cinematography nor the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success it is a simple story told very well that makes it worth any movie watchers' while highly recommended
<START> something strange is happening in loch ness the water is crystal clear nor cold a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots what is this movie first i love reading stories about sea monsters in general when i saw this for sale i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws no it was terrible the story was pointless acting was 100 garbage the only up side was the cool mechanical they used it was full of inaccuracy wrong locations and bad everything not worth your while just leave it on the shelf or garbage can you found it on on second note this film was shot in not loch ness a major diss to fans
