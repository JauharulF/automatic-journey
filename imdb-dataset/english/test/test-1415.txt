<START> hitting the ground running the film begins with three murders in a row no plot no characters no motivation the second murder happens off screen and that victim's severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death this is a high point but the are obviously smart enough to lead with strength soon they're covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot by now this betacam production's horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe with the monumental and rather endearing plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction cop investigates meat cleaver guy slaughters repeat climaxing early with a memorable severed finger in the salad gag only how the hell did the fingers get in the salad and wasn't the blood cult's purpose to collect the appendages they severed when the gore stops making sense you know you're in trouble and without spoiling the big nonsensical twist ending just take my word for it the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode tube smashing impulse the basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life
<START> harrowing series about life in oz an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners there's gay sex rape torture mutilation killings humiliation tons of male nudity all in your face and going full force br br it also is easily one of the best written dramas ever put on tv and almost all the actors are just great since this was on cable there were no restrictions on what they could say or show there's plenty of racist comments flying in here but it's for all races in fact the white characters come off pretty badly especially the aryans and the black characters come off better the peace loving muslims the hispanics don't have a strong role and there are no asian prisoners at all all the prisoners seem to be back and willing to kill anyone at a moments notice but you still find yourself sympathizing with some of them even the guards counselors and doctors at the prison have serious issues br br i heartily recommend this but rent it don't buy it i have the whole collection and to be totally honest i don't think i ever want to see it again it's incredible tv but so grim dark and depressing guess i gotta sell it all online br br i give it a 10
<START> the movie has an excellent screenplay the situation is credible the action has pace first class direction and acting especially the 3 leading actors but the others as well including the mobster who does not seem to be a professional actor br br i wish the movie the director and the actors success
<START> when patricia newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder detective searches the city for her killer identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country for the case is closed or is it blood relatives is an overlooked masterpiece donald sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see donald pleasance in a small role as a child molester the conclusion is pretty disturbing still blood relatives is more of a mystery than a horror film so fans of gore will be disappointed a must see for fans of old fashioned mystery movies 9 out of 10
<START> man is this lousy it doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so keeping it brief rebecca is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio banderas in a wine store he of the ponytail and jail house when she cuts loose she really cuts loose other than this torrid affair she's having and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps she's a pretty cold fish her broke ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out she's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor dennis miller at bay and there's prisoner harry dean stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed br br all these people and perhaps more are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her somebody sends her dead flowers somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat the next time i see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot i'm going to puke so who's doing it guess no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending but maybe a hint will help childhood abuse br br the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself far more interesting than the movie what does childhood abuse mean do we mean sexual abuse physical both how about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon hard enough to break it that's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood sexual abuse that never happened to any of us as far as i know although i'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation in the samoan village i studied for two years there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl the girl's family beat hell out of him the boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village an exile that lasted two years by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone including the child by the way the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember dad's night time visits in any case since long term memory isn't really established until about that time experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma it's not there unless we put it there enough of the psychiatric lecture that will be fifteen cents br br you want trauma i'll give you trauma the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca character right from the beginning then when she has her first tryst with antonio banderas and donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest now that's traumatic it makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the california men's colony in san luis don't get me wrong i don't dislike antonio banderas it's just that i'm not in love with him there aren't enough nude shots of rebecca body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety br br here's an engaging way of surviving this movie instead of just sitting there puling try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and separating them from the ones shot in budapest it's a challenge really and may for all we know preserve your sanity
<START> if you've ever listened to any of the james lee burke books on tape or cd and the reader was will patton you may agree with me that will is the personification of dave r br br tommy lee jones is a native texan or so i've heard and no one portrays a texan better imho but he's not a cajun his delivery is all wrong i lived in the state for several years and i can still hear the strange patois that a louisiana accent contains doesn't have anything like that br br i thought marry was a good choice for but i missed seeing cletus who will be cast in this role the rock mickey rourke whoever he'll have to be big br br overall i thought the movie was only a 4 the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didn't have the normal interesting yet non linear continuity that the book typically has br br hopefully hollywood will try another jlb book last car to fields would be a good choice we'd get to see some of the best villains from jlb ever
<START> like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned we had good reason to do so the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu dark waters the grudge and a tale of two sisters by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003 the market seemed to be drying up leaving it open for mockery and derision despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead now don't get me wrong there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made the likes of and shutter to mention but two will stand as minor genre classics some day but the haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party and was time to take that success drunk tramp home to bed then along comes a film like the curse a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots yet throws the out the window whilst doing it what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all the film is a documentary about one of japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door yet there is no baby there apart from a middle aged woman and her son these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around but strange other coincidences start popping up a psychic young girl a mentally ill clairvoyant a pretty young actress who had a strange vision a lot of dead pigeons and a very sinister demon by the name of leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town br br to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit the film is shot in fashion and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night the comparison ends there really br br what is refreshing about is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences if you are expecting ghost ladies to pop out of the attic look elsewhere the film's strength lies in it's slow gradual build up of terror a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it the climax is pretty damned freaky but just when you think the film is over you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll and sweet holy f ck is it a killer in terms of acting it is mostly convincing you get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy tin foil covered clairvoyant but that soon dries up half way through the film the film also has a slightly feel than a lot of asian ghost horror as there is a violent streak to some of the events too br br overall is one to watch on your own late at night not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late then it is under your skin just let yourself go to this one completely and not a haired ghost lady in sight no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan let alone had an american remake lined up yet check this one out if you can essential viewing in my books
<START> roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low budget career spanning over 300 movies while few if any would call him great his films' obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding corman's mid '90s carnosaur trilogy br br credits are in quotes because raptor isn't a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the film's dinosaur induced death scenes haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dino's eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic e g two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts 2 and 3 where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors' lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in 1950's b films and it certainly doesn't make anything between the ripped off attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the spring loaded animal something is seriously wrong br br as it stands this is a despicable practice in two b grade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they haven't got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isn't much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa navel is that now i don't have to see any of the carnosaur movies
<START> y'know it's very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now dead br br anyways it's been a long time since i've watched anything muppet related but this stuff is pure gold i'm a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing it's not really high speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go br br kermit the frog is just an awesome character his voice and the expressions on his puppet face are fantastic but above all he points out why he's popular he can sing and make jokes too but more appropriately why he's so endearing he without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams in the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an uncommon theme in family movies br br it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less i think mel brook's part was just a bit overplayed do you some parts of the film are just kind of odd but it's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction br br moving right along br br polarisdib
<START> this is quite possible the worst movie ever made i know people talk about how horrible ed wood movies were plan 9 but this movie makes plan 9 look amazing br br chuck norris makes a cameo for what reason i have no idea perhaps to ruin his movie career aside from chuck norris the movie's cast consists of extras in daytime soaps and mike norris that's right chuck's son br br this director doesn't even have a resume and i have no idea where the plot or screenplay originated this must've been green lit by a horrible southern baptist minister that somehow had a 3rd cousin that owned a studio which i'm sure has since been shut down br br i don't really know what else to say about this movie i would like to give you a plot summary but i'm lost there is something about jesus and satan some eternal battle other than that there are indians and a bunch of freaky kids that don't know how to act they're just awkward and should not be on camera i don't know what was going on most of the time but i know the movie was a great laugh mike norris pushes his daughter on her bike into the street somehow but in the shot he's in the middle of the park so somehow she learns to ride her bike with speed equivalent to that of the flash and gets hit by a car or bus i don't know but she's dead this is actually the funniest scene in the movie i know that sounds sick but once you see mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror you'll understand it doesn't show the daughter getting hit or anything you just have to assume she got hit by some vehicle but the movie's not clear so maybe it was completely unrelated and she died from cancer anyway after that the movie gets really confusing and i have no idea what really happens i am a christian and i have no idea why this movie was made i don't see any value for this movie in a religious or non religious sector this is probably the first thing they show students in film making 101 this is what you don't want to do br br just see it you'll hate it and me for suggesting that you see it
<START> i was blown away when i saw the best years of our lives the acting script and master william wyler's direction winner of best director in 1946 is brilliant br br this film is about three wwii veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones but have to deal with the hardships of coming home from the war br br the first man al stephenson played by march in his oscar winning role comes home to find his wife millie played by myrna loy and children peggy and rob played by teresa wright and michael hall are more grown up and different than before he left for the war br br the second man fred derry played by dana andrews has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war he begins to find out that she is not the same br br homer parish played by harold russell in his oscar winning role has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and fiance' played by cathy o'donnell reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands br br all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes the stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together br br this film truly defines the meaning of a classic this unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see br br if i was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it br br out of 10 i would give the best years of our lives an 10 br br so next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you won't regret it br br no objectionable material a good family film
<START> royal rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn good the rumble itself is pretty uneventful filled with mid and a winner that really had no point in winning and why on earth did the young vs the islanders main event half the crowd left jessie ventura sounds bored through half the thing and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of hogan vs andre more interesting mcmahon and ventura don't have the chemistry of gorilla and jessie br br ricky steamboat vs ravishing rick rude heavily disappointing match with too many rest holds and too much of a sluggish pace sink this one when it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes it's too little too late steamboat wins by dq br br 2 1 2 5 br br next is up dino bravo attempting to set a new bench press record with ventura spotting him horrendous segment with no entertainment value what so ever ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment and even mcmahon admitted it was boring controversy or not i wasted enough time on this crap br br 0 5 br br wwf woman's tag team championship br br 2 out of 3 falls br br the glamour girls c w jimmy hart vs the jumping bomb angels this is the best match of the night no i'm not kidding very exciting stuff for woman's wrestling and you'll be hard pressed to find stuff this good now a days the jumping bomb angels were way over and the crowd went ape sh t for their title win br br 3 5 br br contract signing between hulk hogan and andre the giant hogan gets a decent pop but there a few noticeable for him probably because its in canada a bit too drawn out for my liking but it was necessary for the storyline it got it's point across and had some effective moments but a lot of the times i kept saying get on with it both sign and andre slams hogan's head on the table and pushes the table on him br br 2 1 2 5 br br royal rumble match very weak royal rumble probably due to awkward pacing and the true lack of star power i think vince was testing the waters with this one and it showed ventura seems uninterested and i don't blame him crowd clearly wanted roberts to win yelling ddt almost every 5 minutes he was in there and while duggan got a good pop i don't believe he was the winner they wanted and where did this take his career nowhere 1st ever royal rumble and he made an impressive showing it wasn't terrible but it was quite lackluster and it didn't have enough to make the show considering this was what the show was based on br br 2 1 2 5 br br hogan has an interview with craig standard interview but not with the same craziness and outrageous remarks he usually pulls br br 2 5 br br ted and andre get interviewed andre claims he will deliver the championship to mr dibiase short but effective br br 3 5 br br 2 out of 3 falls br br the islanders vs the young crowd is completely dead for this and half of them bolted for the it's quite dull and had no business being in the main event jessie and vince seem bored and argue about other things while the match is taking place islanders win due to taking advantage of injury br br 2 5 br br bottom line historically important i suppose but there is really nothing to see here this was just a starting cue for great things to come for the royal rumble and while you can see glimpses of potential here there is nothing on here going out of your way to see i usually recommend everything once for die hard wrestling fans and considering it's the 1st royal rumble event i suppose i have too but prepare to be bored a lot of the time br br 3 10
<START> a long overdue concert release rush in rio dvd is both compelling and disappointing this slick two disc set shows rush at their finest after 30 years of honing their unique sound it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever br br the concert features over two dozen songs a documentary and three songs that feature multi angle viewing packaged in a bi fold holder with sleeve and a small insert it's priced very well for the amount of material it contains br br i'm a rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period and this dvd comes through big with half of the show highlighting songs from that era i won't list the songs in case you want to be surprised if you attended the vapor trails tour then you'll know what they'll be playing br br playing in rio to their biggest crowd ever rush is a huge crowd pleaser here in fact that was one of the first things i noticed that was peculiar about this show throughout most of this two hour concert you hear and see the crowd actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music at first it's heartening to see the fans give rush a well deserved response but after several songs i was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd this is in no way a slam of the crowd of rio more power to them it's a critique of the final editing of the dvd br br which brings me to my second and main reason i hate it the video editing is terrible in my opinion save for the multi angle view bonus cuts the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos it's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it i count changing camera angles on average between every one and four seconds constantly after about three or four songs my head and eyes were ready for a break which is too bad because i would have liked to have sat through the whole show like i was able to at the concert last year maybe this fast cut editing is the latest craze for concert dvd's but i really think it's an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience as stated before i wouldn't mind it for a song or two but the whole visual aspect of this disc is hurried or rushed it's really ironic because all the previous concert clips i've seen of rush mainly from moving pictures are strictly straight filmed with little switching back and forth it's almost boring visually speaking this dvd has taken it to the other extreme i know a lot of dyed in the wool rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements but that's just my impression of it br br the bottom line if you're a rush fan you'll buy this dvd regardless of my review or any other i still would have bought it after i had read my review just don't get expect a normal concert who knows the things mentioned above might not bother you
<START> deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about the story line is ok cinematography is outstanding screenplay and acting are way below average i guess the blame is to the citizens of in india from where her original set was destroyed in 2000 this resulted in a totally different cast i just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original shabana azmi nandita das and aamir khan the current actors lisa ray who's just good for squirming in bombay dyeing bedsheets and john abraham are pathetic need basic lessons in acting seema biswas raghubir yadav and have saved the movie as much as they can the kid had done an outstanding job the editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from deepa great subject sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural india but falls short of the standards deepa set for herself in fire and earth watch it once when its on dvd don't bother paying 10 to see it well its out beats the average hindi movie any day
<START> this is an outstanding criminal thriller and with a great cast too spanish language cinema's best and most popular actors of the past couple of decades victoria abril and federico team up in one of the better spanish language crime thrillers of 2004 5 br br the film begins by focusing on thirty something ernesto ernesto alterio an elegant attractive and slick thief who learned from childhood friend and more recently from manco an old seasoned swindler manco introduces ernesto to federico federico an also elegant but more astute experienced methodical thief the best in his class br br only known weakness is pilar victoria abril his former mistress and partner she suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous rip off scheme to her former lover a crime in grand scale which will eventually require the help of ernesto manco and among others br br the script is full of twists and surprising reversals particularly towards the end of the film one criticism about the film i've heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end but i disagree the film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow in fact these are what make the film outstanding i highly recommend it
