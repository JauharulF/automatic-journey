<START> douglas sirk's inaugural women's picture weepy for universal based on a preachy dogmatic didactic novel by the intolerable lloyd c douglas author of that other beloved piece of crap the robe rock hudson in the role that catapulted him to stardom plays bob a drunken playboy worth untold millions who is more interested in chasing skirts and racing than in finishing his medical degree in the first scene he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake the accident nearly kills and thus he requires a rather mysterious machine to keep him alive meanwhile across town beloved surgeon dr phillips finally drops dead from a heart condition since the local hospital can maintain only one at a time phillips dies so that the louse may live when learns of this he tries to make apologetic overtures to phillips' family especially to the widow jane wyman coiffed and clothed in matronly hauteur but indeed anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits at like a brace of cobras one doctor on the hospital staff even calls it a total waste that the playboy lived instead of the christ like surgeon might have had something to say about that br br these early scenes are where you'll find the typical the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of middle class mid century america that one finds oneself rooting for the wastrel playboy to put whoopee cushions under the of these moral hypocrites but alas no the risible plot of the novel must proceed and soon finds himself getting converted by god in the guise of pipe puffing otto kruger an artist who claims that phillips made him a better man and even a better painter why don't we see any of this amazing art we learn that the intolerably ubiquitous dr phillips would often refuse payment for medical services rendered though who exactly qualified for these magnificent is never made clear this is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new outlook on life and an example of personal conduct kruger even tries to make it all sound very illicitly exciting once you start this thing there's no way out of it it's an obsession a magnificent obsession so tries it out by again the widow with apologetic overtures but he somehow causes her to get hit by a car she loses her eyesight apparently will have several more stations of the cross to trudge past before he can be accounted a decent fellow br br but sirk continues to sneak in his even as the movie grows more and more preachy the most obvious bit has to be the presence of agnes moorehead as the head hospital nurse and friend and unrequited lesbian lover note the disappointment on face when finally redeemed as a doctor shows up to save life near the end hudson's own homosexuality an open secret in hollywood at the time is also used to great ironic effect he and wyman dowdy and fifteen years older generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together which by the way are purposefully few presumably because any more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole enterprise one thing we feel certain of if rock hudson was obsessed by anything it certainly wasn't jane wyman it's a chronic case of tea and sympathy sirk seemed to enjoy tweaking everyone's noses by having this gay actor who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era coolly drift through these exquisitely colored women's pictures in fact the director worked with hudson 6 or 7 more times to best effect in the follow up to this film all that heaven allows which re teamed hudson with wyman but was also accompanied by a realistic plot in obsession meanwhile we must endure god kruger gazing down from an observation window onto and his medical team as they prepare to save life in tandem with a musical score of swelling vocals from a cheesy hollywood choir br br but to see why sirk is considered an auteur check out the scene wherein wyman explains to her grown daughter that she can in fact tell the difference from night and day the entire frame is blackened here the daughter is barely visible and face is faintly silhouetted against a faint light she goes on to say that she hates the night because i know that dawn will never come again a great chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than magnificent obsession br br 4 stars out of 10
<START> sam elliot is brilliant as a tough san francisco detective charlie fallon when his partner is killed while meeting with an informant fallon snaps beats the informant to death and dumps his body in a river the next day fallon is assigned a rookie partner and given the task of investigating the informants murder sam elliot does a good job of portraying a man who tortured by the guilt of his own murderous actions and grief over the death of his partner who may have been involved in police corruption
<START> visconti's death in venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made while watching we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius endlessly opulent death in venice surely is but in other important ways it's an unsatisfying film thomas mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von literary career and output of his imperious manner his layer upon layer of programmed self conscious behavior when appears and obsession arises it's evident that hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his gilded age trappings and carefully lived life in fact upon seeing the ' as mann sometimes calls him splits in two no 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14 year old boy then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as he would a work of art a work of art but no 2 emerges as a stalker who takes control of then replaces the rational no 1 like the original his sexual doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession and thus remains a far off ideal thomas mann has no mercy for this game every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist that venice is gripped by disease means nothing to except that his game now has higher stakes when he finally whispers beneath his breath 'i love you ' he knows that all is lost and the abyss awaits is any of this filmable perhaps and visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from but there are errors he and dirk bogarde create as sympathetic mann again did not pov dominates the film and we are expected to identify but nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within bogarde between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease but what's underneath reactive performance has no mann writes a character who is in his imagination doing the dance of the seven veils all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites yet unable unwilling to resist also visconti's screenplay creates a character not in the original alfred a friend of to dramatize mann's discussion of art and artists these scenes are badly written disasters and the actor who portrays alfred is difficult to watch also visconti's is a gilded age teutonic composer which i think works for the film and the symphonies of substitute for novels great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played so death in venice as visconti hands it to us is not the complete success it might have been but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied all students of film especially cinematography will want to take a look
<START> it is characteristic that this film is not better known it obviously lacks most elements that a successful theater film needs heroes villains conflict and resolution romantic love interest br br everything is topsy turvy here nothing works out as it should everyone is clumsy sad angry hurt and hungry and nobody has a solution for anything in short it is war and it is hell for everybody involved people try to do best but interests allegiances and so called duty interfere the picture transports us back in time to the civil war with an intensity seldom seen in today's cinema straightforward honest images of an intense beauty the actors are very well cast for the story and they make the characters come truly alive in front of our eyes br br a silver dollar in a heap of nickels
<START> hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers br br this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene br br fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmosphere br br watch any episode of csi instead it's to the point and far more exciting
<START> alexander nevsky is rightfully held up as a cinematic masterpiece it has however aged very badly people decide not to mention this and talk about the great battles and the great music the sound effects may have been good then but apart from the foreboding organ all the sounds are risible i may be shot by film buffs for this but i'm sure the modern viewer of alexander nevsky will agree that the blatant propaganda and the appalling music to detract from the film i gave this film 10 10 because it is undeniably a master piece it does have its great bits however the costumes of the teutonic knights are superb and the battle scenes are fairly good for the time it is however a master piece that is showing it's age
<START> i haven't seen this funny of a show on fox in a long time and the wait was worth it the kids in the show have something that i can relate to on every episode and even my dad will sit down and watch it it is a show not for all ages that doesn't dumb down for kids it is like still standing but to the next level the stuff that everyone says is stuff that everyone says and actions that everyone does it says stuff that we all think but in a well rounded way of presentation the first time i saw the show i could not believe that it was on fox and that it was allowed to stay on the air after a few episodes from hilary's boyfriend choices to kenny's boyfriend choices it is well worth the watch
<START> i watched this show until my puberty but still i found it to reflex many situations that worry us when we're teenagers although it was a family oriented show until the mid 90's it focused more on the young adults and their situations br br that's why i loved step by step i mean it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it's kind it delivered expectations br br let's be honest this wasn't an extremely funny show no but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier br br there was an extremely good charm between patrick duffy and susan sommers duffy rocked sommers was tender and actually funny i was in love with stacy because she was extremely sexy loved her legs and witty but sasha mitchell stole the show with his cody character he was the man back in the day oh the memories nowadays this show wasn't been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that's why it should be kept in the vault of memories that's it only memories br br thank you step by step for making my puberty funnier
<START> i could almost wish this movie had not been made stan laurel was dying and it shows in his face even more angular and gaunt than usual a poor script and inept supporting cast
<START> 1960's kid show with ex vaudevillians playing handy men for hire as you can expect they are a disaster at everything they do over the course of the 11 minute episodes leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15 minute time slot they do things like set up a fence between warring neighbors help a magician on stage and deal with a found trunk and wallet br br growing up i had never run across this show which appears to have been shot in new york i thought i had run heard of or seen a most of the children's shows from the period either through having watched them as a kid or viewed them at nostalgia conventions until alpha video released it on dvd i had been completely unaware if its existence br br the show plays like the three stooges mixed with abbott and costello as done by people aping the routines indeed one of the pair claims to have created the legendary slowly i turned routine that abbott and costello perfected its not bad but its really not good either since everything seems watered down the timing is often off though that maybe due to bad direction and the jokes were recycled years before the show first ran odds are you've seen it all before on the plus side its the type of thing that would be perfect to introduce very young kids to the magic of vaudeville style comedy however its going to be trying for parents to sit through even with the short episodes br br for nostalgia junkies only everyone else should look to seeing an abbott and costello or three stooges original
<START> i first saw this movie back in the early 90's and instantly fell in love with it richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie saturday the 14th in 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983 i think they work quite well together this movie made me laugh on several occasions it also has a young molly ringwald who would later go on in the late 1980's to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candles it is fun watching her a little younger although not seen by many people i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie but when i first came it i was glad i did i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy lastly i would like to say its not available on dvd so i picked up a vhs copy on ebay so if your interested you probably can find one on there it might be in the 20 30 dollar range but i got mind for 12 bucks i wish they would eventually release this on dvd
<START> as a big fan of brian yuzna and the majority of the movies he's been involved in i guessed i'd enjoy progeny i didn't although in ways it has it's moments however if you're expecting something of the calibre of society or beyond reanimator you could be in for a shock in a way this is similar to society being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrific supernatural underbelly but that's where it ends br br i'm not covering for yuzna when i say that the fault doesn't really lie with him as bad direction is bad direction but the direction is sound what trips the movie up is both script and acting stuart gordon reanimator dagon has written an intelligent script but one that doesn't really work with yuzna's style of direction leaving him paused on actors delivering lengthy dialogue when really he wants to throw that camera around and get down with his bad self this matter makes the movie awkward enough as it is but there's worse br br if the movie had been made with great actors the movie would have probably held it's own unfortunately this is very far from the case the acting is wooden shockingly so even for a low budget b feature the inexplicably successful and renowned arnold vosloo wrecks every damn line with near pinpoint precision handing in one of the worst performances i've seen in a long while the man manages to turn every line of well considered dialogue into the kind of ham line you'll be throwing drunkenly at mates next time you're in the pub 'hey bob good god am i going mad what's come over me noooo ' in fact i may try that one myself next weekend the last minute addition of genre veteran and personal favourite brad dourif instead of enriching the film like it should almost seems to hand dourif the movie in a last ditch effort to stop vosloo from hamming but quite frankly dourif looks deeply uncomfortable possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting next to vosloo and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resuscitate the film br br if the acting was better this movie would have been okay hell it might have been pretty enjoyable but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film i found the alien torture rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant leaving a nasty taste in the mouth br br so if you really like sci fi and don't have a problem with bad acting pedestrian pacing and a really garish nasty rape scene progeny will probably be your cup of tea but since i do i'm probably never going to watch it again once was enough on the plus side this is the only sci fi movie yuzna ever bothered to make so he obviously wasn't really that pleased with it himself
<START> i've just seen this movie and it made me cry it's a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love and i think it's a good idea especially for the closed minded to watch this one i have come to love the short film genre after just having seen a couple because they have to make an impression on you so fast and i have to say that this one definitely sat it's mark it described some things that i haven't ever really thought about that way incest for one br br i have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending just once i would like to watch a gay themed movie without wanting to kill myself after wards they seem to pretty much always end in tragedy it was 'cute' though how that they had to be together even if it was in death br br i gave it eight stars and i recommend it too everyone cause i think it gives an 'inside look' in the world that this movie make you enter br br thanks for listening enjoy
<START> i watch the show every day and it is very entertaining it provides updates of tech news video games pretty much everything geek they are also the official broadcasters of and comiccon if you are a geek gamers or anything really you will enjoy this show they have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review 2006 it's the only place that i get my tech info kevin pereira and olivia munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game movie comic universe if you know those universes you will understand the jokes long story short is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about i'm watching it right now as i type this they are 'in' san diego covering the red bull air races sweet
<START> gere diane lane back again in another romantic love story they are an excellent team but somehow this film will not be among there best br br the director george wolfe using a screenplay by ann peacock john for nicholas sparks novel does a capable job this is yet another tale of 2 strangers meeting falling in love then they go on there way then when they are about to meet again start a life together br br spoiler but not really tragedy happens one of them dies br br how many times have we seen this already br br those who never saw tearjerkers like this will hopefully like it more than i did this story has about every clichÃ© there is br br the only reason this has the ratings i will give it is because of the fine acting excellent production the cast besides our 2 stars includes christopher meloni viola davis scott glenn they all give real good performances do the very best with the material they were given br br there is a good but not over done storm sequence the sex scenes are well done no nudity next to no foul language br br ratings out of 4 82 points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
