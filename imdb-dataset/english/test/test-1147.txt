<START> this is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the butcher who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature seul contre tous in this film it follows the early period of his life from 1965 1979 but focusing on the late seventies the first images are of a slaughter of a horse then the birth of a baby the butcher's daughter who we quickly see growing up each year the butcher played by philippe in both films is a man bitter with the world he hates many things his anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter the butcher then maims the wrong man and finds himself in prison br br this film follows the butcher's life to just after his release from prison then seul contre tous takes over from there i watched the films the wrong way about seul contre tous first try and watch this little film first if you can
<START> wow i just saw this movie on the sundance channel and it really is bizarre i may not be a film expert but it's probably the most bizarre film i as an average movie fan have seen br br whoever came up with with it had a great imagination i'm a bit of a fan of japanese dramas and there are often actors from dramas in movies for example the lead in ringu is a major j drama star but it looks like this is the first film for and portrayers i must say if they really are debuting here they do a pretty good job br br was a very sympathetic character i thought she was easy to relate with she was kind and good hearted perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attention seeking girls she was also pretty in a classic kind of way i hope she does more films but it's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans br br the ending was odd i'm not going to give anything away but the rest of the movie's bizarreness was kind of put to shame br br very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie i'd recommend it for japanese horror fans though i'll warn you it's a lot more bizarre than ringu br br nonetheless i'd give it a 7 5 out of 10 for originality imagination good characterization above average acting and just being plain intriguing
<START> as a movie the italian job is ok at best good not great acting br br nice visuals and pacing a mediocre plot but nothing bad enough br br to walk out on but as a car commercial for the new breed of mini br br coopers this film is spectacular br br spoilers br br ok it's a typical heist film with the odd twist the underwater safe cracking was nice if not improbable and the cast was fairly solid br br with the exception of a putrid wahlberg but when it all came br br down to it the real stars of this picture were the three mini br br coopers in all their high flying speed racing ramp jumping br br bullet taking gold lugging shiny new glory the audience i was br br sitting amongst actually and when theron's little br br red number first hit the screen strangely enough neither she nor br br wahlberg garnered the same reaction br br the film starts out promising mos def seth green donald br br sutherland edward norton and jason statham all begin as an br br interesting and humourous band of characters with the only real br br uninspired performance being that of the usually good mark br br wahlberg why he claims this is his best film i can't imagine his br br character is completely one note and he plays him so blandly it br br was as if mr rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting br br his body charlize is fine as sutherland's daughter though br br nothing magical seth green's character is perfect and the br br running jokes including a cameo by founder br br shawn fanning are hilarious he and some of mos def's early br br lines add some much needed sparks of humour unfortunately br br edward norton and donald sutherland don't get near enough br br screen time br br you can see most of the plot coming from a mile away and the br br dialogue is rife with bad one liners and give aways but i doubt the br br filmmakers were out to re invent the wheel here so taken as a br br typical action suspense flick it comes out alright worth seeing on br br cheap night i'd recommend br br 7 10 not worth it's weight in gold but makes for nice fillings
<START> i should have known better the clues were all over imdb com this flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record the cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of joe estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies etc suffice it to say i can't see any reason why anyone would want to see this awful amateurish attempt at film making turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies nuff said
<START> since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline i won't do it br br however i'd like to restate that interpretation is terrific as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film br br reading the previous comments i've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed in my honest opinion this is far from true br br there are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving ramÃ³n and wanting him to stay and understanding his desire to die most obvious of those are the family for instance sister in law never talks for or against euthanasia another such character is the social rights activist who in the last moment tells ramÃ³n to re think it all the scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die br br then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia brother is clearly against it as is his father there's only one thing worse than the death of son and it's having a son that wants to die other users have commented that the discussion between ramÃ³n and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that ramÃ³n is good and the priest is bad well no doubt the scene is comic but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed from my point of view the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince ramÃ³n to keep on living using arguments totally alien to thinking the priest's speech goes on the line of god gives and god takes we aren't the owners of our own lives they belong to god and so on the comedy arises from the fact that ramÃ³n is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense br br this film is the antithesis of it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his her own opinion and above anything else is a chant of freedom
<START> may contain spoilers br br clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just can't see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name br br anyhow where to begin the bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over the top characters and more inconsistencies than george w bush's college career i don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack were getting killed also one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film how do we know it's him like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs a great camp film but a very bad film overall
<START> tycoon will never be listed as one of john wayne's better post stagecoach film it's good in spots has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax but the plot leaves a lot to be desired br br what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right br br things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwicke's daughter laraine day after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin by convention in south america wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened br br what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another their petty cause some fatalities among wayne's crew br br but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness laraine day was married to leo the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed he was a constant presence on the set insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife nothing to it but he made his wife's life miserable br br not one of the duke's better efforts
<START> clyde borrows the premise of this short from buster keaton's seven chances recently tepidly remade as the bachelor in the original buster has 24 hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money in this version musical teacher prof shemp has only 7 hours after all it is a short this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines including the telephone booth scene with moe shemp reminiscent of laurel hardy's berth marks and the marx brothers famous scene in night at the opera here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine i'm not a huge stooges fan but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts
<START> this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo of course vicente is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don't think this is one of his greatest movies even if it's fine the screenplay plays with the introduction of as a character it's a nice touch but it's unbelievable the music is composed by jose national spanish prize in cinema i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio maria and others i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all
<START> it is difficult to imagine how the engaging dan brown novel angels and demons could misfire as badly as this film version here are ten reasons why the film was a failure due to the spoilers please do no read on unless you have already seen the film br br 1 in the film there was no love relationship between robert langdon and worse still there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors br br 2 the breathtaking locations in rome as described in the novel were not realized visually in the film i am aware that director ron howard encountered difficulties in filming on location but there are superior photographed depictions of rome on the history channel than in this film where the eternal city was presented in eternal stock film footage the great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film the magnificent sculpture of the ecstasy of st teresa was only momentarily glimpsed and the west relief in vatican square was not visible at all br br 3 the most tasteless choice made by the film maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved john paul ii in the novel the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope br br 4 one of the most colorful and important characters of the novel maximilian kohler director of was cut out of the screenplay br br 5 there were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise br br 6 there were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting this technique worked in the godfather films but ron howard is no gordon willis br br 7 the college of cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the speaking in a southern drawl this dude would have been more at home on a texas ranch than in the sistine chapel br br 8 the crucial relationship of the and the deceased pope was not defined in the film this relationship was central to the theme of science vs religion and the relevance of the to the plot against the church br br 9 in the novel the character of was an unforgettable villain in the film that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain br br 10 as a whole the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel br br in the novel langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the river in ron howard's film it was the movie itself that landed in the

<START> children of wax also shown as killing grounds is an interesting mixture of genres some might think the purity of the genre can be only for good but to me the eclectic is very entertaining it is also in it's story the mixture of thriller and the popular action as well as the combination of the historic masterpiece and the ethnic plea for tolerance this film is built with the starry presence of my favorite actor the perfect armand assante but it is also marked by the acting of a shooting star Â hal we have recently seen him in the tv series on hbo called sex children of wax is entertainment for the audience but the same time it has an everlasting moral for the ethnic tolerance this is a wise way to welfare discussion on the contemporary troubles of our days can be made with attractive means in this is very positive side of the film children of wax
<START> this is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game i have ever encountered every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't walk through the cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements but only to a slight degree also you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to get past the intro it's terrible i am afraid if i play this game any more i will end up breaking something this game sucks the graphics are good but nothing special the game play however is awful to say i hate this game would be a huge understatement i got it on sale but i want my 20 back what a waste
<START> first off just let me say that i live in south africa where rugby is our biggest sport by far and our national side the have won the rugby world cup twice so it's quite a big deal over here i've played all my life and i'm shocked at the poor attention to detail in this movie at first i thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of neal mcdonough nick ferris gary cole and sean astin for goodness sake but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport they basically mashed it together with your normal everyday american football movie br br my first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values of rugby but the discipline or should i say the total lack thereof during the games are contradictory to this in the final it looks more like an nfl game with penning being tackled of the ball numerous times in front of the referee that would've immediately led to a couple of red cards because foul play like that would never go unpunished in by a referee of that i can assure you you'd also not be able to find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over his team any coach would take a dump on a players head if he intentionally stiff arms an opposing player or double teams him like they did in the final red card and certain suspension full stop br br secondly it's absurd that a coach would take a brand new player who has played wing all of his life i gather move him to hooker which is a highly specialized position and say that it's for the good of the team what hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to be able to extremely well and preferably be able to throw the ball in at line out time which penning never does for some or other reason by moving a wing to hooker without any extensive long term training it would firstly lead to your team's demise at time secondly the poor kid would probably break his neck how is that good for the team i ask you finally the overall high emotional pitch of the movie is way too much because even though rugby is a great sport and it builds great friendships team spirit it rarely gets that out of hand corny i've seen true life football drama's with less emotion than this movie it turned out great but in this one sean's penning acting skills is dragged way too far and the movie attempts too force an emotional response out of the audience which ends up being boring and hard to watch at times br br hollywood have made some great sports movies over the years but next time they venture into a sport which has just recently picked up in the states they should try and do their homework maybe get some experts into the fray br br do it right or don't do it at all
