<START> this soft soft core sci fi b movie is what you'd have if you took an early fred olen ray film and took out the fun or conversely it's like an uwe boll 'movie' but without as much ineptitude a young nubile chain gang convict c c costigan agrees to pose as a space marshal in order to stop wacky kim dawson's plans of having everyone have sex with everyone else apparently that vile fiend anyone who went into this film looking for serious science fiction well you got what you deserved for not doing any homework on the film at all first of all when did kim dawson ever star in anything other than soft core skinamax level crap for that matter take a look at the resume's for costigan and the director before you take a hissy fit saying you expected something else don't get me wrong for a space action soft core titillation flick this film is still not good but if you expected something along the lines of contact i do not pity you br br my grade d br br where i saw it starz on demand available until december 8th 2005
<START> the movie which was directed by alfred hitchcock was brilliantly made it starts with a family of three a doctor james stewart his wife doris day who is a former stage singer and their young son my guess is about 10 years old who are traveling through for leisure on the bus the bump into a french government agent and they are a little too nice to him he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought he wants to carry this information out to someone so he goes to the only person he even slightly knows james stewart the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him his son would be killed stewart has to travel to london because that is where his son is and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be the movie is very suspenseful there are many twists and turns typical hitchcock movie also it has just the right amount of comic relief in addition to all of that it won an oscar for doris day's performance of que sara sara this movie is very good it is hard to find a problem about it i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans i give this movie an a only because it is a little bit predictable
<START> my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction well not liking either michael douglas or glenn close i would have to agree not for conventional reasons though br br this is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet br br yancy butler is a really enjoyable bad guy she is not the best of actresses in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film everyone else in it varies from pine to oak including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped pinocchio br br spoiler the ending goes a step or two too far complete with the clichÃ© not quite dead up with a roar still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the make up br br regardless it's a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat don't pay for it but if you're in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right
<START> it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues due to of and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth adding to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary br br to most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual testimonies and real life footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were 3 members of crickets and that buddy's music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddy's wife after his death criticism and or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we don't manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past that the documentary tells us br br personally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which allows film makers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations br br movie goers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a film maker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies
<START> it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on i did not like the film it's crappy br br there are orgies they have taboo sex gay sex bi sex oral sex rape anal sex masturbation brother sister sex brother brother sex sex on drugs sex without drugs sex sex sex seems to rule their world i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid the story is just dirty and shameful i wonder what made those people get up with this story and above all who cares br br the technical stuff didn't satisfy me as well the sound is poor so is the editing and the direction is absent the actors are admittedly fine but guess what it's their job their job is to act no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely see br br i gave it 2 10 because after all this thing had something that i can't put in words b movie charm camp fun nudity i don't know
<START> that separate good memorable movies from movies like this its not entertaining touching funny interesting and at times feels a little sub human the principals act like they are other worldly in the worse way when they are supposed to be relating to each other and the audience br br starts out conventionally enough rich kid gets new car for graduation but the dean says he can't have the car until after the ceremony goes joy riding nonetheless and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels wise asses the waitress girlfriend of the head yokel shockingly they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner they left three minutes earlier aren't all diners five feet from the gas station br br they told they have to pay the price in court so the only reason to get this 'fish out of water' to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to assist in the rebuilding of the diner worse than that the rich kid in staying with the family of the un rich kid in the room above the attic that 'room above the has rescued many a person in need of a bed br br rich kid inexplicably is treated well by the girlfriend who never mentions to him that he nearly killed her this does not bode well of course with her boyfriend and is never fully explained you don't know why sam leelee sobieski falls for kelley chris klein or why jasper josh hartnett allows it br br chris klein is tolerable leelee completely intolerable and josh does not register much of an impression the character with the most life is the judge that sentences kelley and jasper to help re build the diner she gets off at least one funny remark which is more than anyone else does everyone is so morose and humorless that you will feel a little sill if you even think of smiling while the movie is on br br the ending is one way to end the piece not the most original but at least it was over i don't enjoy trashing a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world might really love but since i am not one i have to the nicest thing i can say about this movie is that its not mean spirited and although it fails to compel its innocence and home spun corny dialogue comes from a nice place 4 10
<START> after missing out on this innumerable times on tcm uk i decided to check it out given its sci fi adventure camp pedigree i knew iâd be in for a thoroughly silly ride â but it was also astoundingly bad anyway perhaps appropriately given the characters involved the script rips off many sci fi titles then of recent vintage â soylent green 1973 zardoz 1974 run 1976 to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self same sets star wars 1977 alien 1979 and mad max 2 the road warrior 1981 br br the plot is simple but not exactly engaging from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place â so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical templar rulers also involved is a beautiful princess mary crosby daughter of bing in search of her father the deposed king by the way the cast includes another famous offspring anjelica huston daughter of john as one of the pirate band â thankfully the mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an oscar under her fatherâs guidance no less for honor 1985 since star wars had peter cushing as the the film makers opted to have a screen legend of their own â 78 year old john carradine whoâs seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene br br the most notable bits for all the wrong reasons are the alien using the toilet the castration machine the clumsy antics including karate style combat of the inevitable robot companions the goofy slave eunuch make up worn at one point by the heroes the recurring attacks by the whatever that is the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time warp crosby becomes pregnant gives birth and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds while leading man robert urich himself is replaced by john ford stalwart hank worden for this scene â incidentally the jump cuts adopted here intending to denote the rapid passage of time are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating
<START> this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life it is a complete waste of money and time i went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie said wow what a good movie someone actually walked out it was absolutely terrible it was disgusting and i hated every minute of it my friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with rick on the ceiling peeing she had had enough it was not funny at all believe me i went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it it was ridiculous i've seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst i mean a scene in the movie is with an old man making out with a dead person in a coffin i just can't make up these things
<START> with its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye kira this is re atonement br br this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2 poet dylan thomas his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales br br vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately
<START> oh how i laughed this has it all an asian white family a disabled asian boy everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the bbc br br what utter tribe this was a total insult to my eyes that viewed this rubbish for one episode and one episode only br br when you think of some of the quality the bbc has put out over the years fawlty towers for example and then this comes rolling in its a disgusting disgrace br br its all geared on political correctness and is devoid of any humour whatsoever br br this is straight from the bowels of hell but what would you expect from the ultra left wing i mean bbc
<START> night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80's demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies this movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie a definite welcome addition after the 80's were overrun by slasher flicks it was nice to see something a little different br br the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour hosted by angela about 40 minutes of boozing and eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens add some snazzy make up effects lots of gore and cool looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80's cheese fest that would be ranked as one of the best demon related films in many horror fans' lists br br firstly i loved the setting for this movie hull house is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge that's when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear this movie spawned 2 sequels the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come br br all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons that's definitely worth checking out
<START> this movie had very little good points the special effects and acting was horrible for sure but it was a movie made on a low budget so you dont expect much from it it does have some laughs i doubt they are intended though the scene where the old woman bends down and touches dung that was on the floor then puts it to her nose and goes in a really stupid raspy voice was priceless all in all if you have nothing else to watch and just want to laugh at a really crappy flick trying to cash in on the blair witch success then grab it other then that dont bother
<START> i'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome i guess it's not for everyone because it's basically kafka's the trial meets and butt head which is a pretty tough combination to swallow still i thought it was great if you're going to see it because you want a sequel to office space you're probably going to be disappointed but if you want to see one of the most brutal acid tongued and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat i just saw the 8pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater which means the film will probably be gone in a week that's really a shame because in its own way idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while but then again it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99 of the movie going audience so i guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it
<START> i have walked out of a coen movie before and not quite known how to feel the two best examples of that are the big lebowski and fargo lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that i had to like it on the other hand there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film still i liked the film and now own a copy of it fargo made me howl with hysterics sometimes i wasn't sure why i was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless i was there were many seemingly strange characters in fargo but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations that is why the man with the shovel or was it a broom was so side splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night and that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in i own a copy of this film too the coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall but if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true that is what is quite exceptional about o brother where art thou this is a film that is out there i mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film i reviewed the film shaft this past summer and in it i said that shaft was an okay film that i have seen a thousand times before but you can not say that about a coen brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one br br this film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians muses references to what i can only assume are historical figures riverside bank robberies violence towards animals singing flocks of religious fanatics kkk lynch mobs and so on there are obviously many references to homer's odyssey in here as well but i wouldn't know that because i have never read homer's odyssey or even knew one thing about it every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof like quality towards it makes the film that much better well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it i can tell you that it is still an entertaining film there were times when again as is usual for a coen film i wasn't sure why i was entertained or laughing but i was br br this is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates he has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape br br i like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are coen cronies it was nice to see goodman again it was nice to see hunter and especially turturro who seems to have a place in every coen film it's too bad they didn't find a place for steve buscemi but that is a different story all together but back to clooney the man just has charisma he is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies his work here is quite awesome and i really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character br br now after heaping all this praise on the film let me just say this as well i didn't really enjoy the film at first i found it to be quite tedious and a little boring there were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth but then the film began to grow on me it took a while but it did grow on me i don't think this is their best film but it is still a good one and i am giving it a 8 5 but the reason that i do recommend this film is for one reason only br br every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film most films have been recycled in some form or another not the coen's films they have not been recycled and if they have i don't know about it that is reason enough to see something that they put out originality counts for a lot in my books the are original and they are good and that is not common in todays cinema enjoy them while they are allowed to make films because you don't get vision like this in many films so when you do enjoy it
<START> actually i am not narrating the main plot in this comment but with just 2 3 sentences i can make it a spoiler ok here are these br br speed is just a 85 conversion of hollywood flick cellular into bollywood by using the software bhatt title has no match with the story only it goes in the thriller direction just that it doesn't deserve even a single star for its imitation imperfect casting poor standard and predictable story undoubtedly now i can say that bhatt is slowly vanishing away from his director status as no any matured audience will appreciate his recent works including this beside him too making his outlook as cartoon comic type who knows how long will he last in the film industry more sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a c grade movie but most supportive role was played by khan which was somewhat identical with chris evan's role as ryan in cellular with innocent face sanjay suri has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress that's why those who have already watched cellular i advise you never to waste your time again with this imitation sack
