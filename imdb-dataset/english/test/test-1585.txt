<START> the over riding problem with this film is that it can't possibly use bill murray to the best of his abilities simply because of the co star br br if this was a road movie with another comedic actor it might work even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue as it stands murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter essentially it means that murray is talking to himself and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce off br br kids would enjoy this movie simply because of the elephant but anyone wanting to watch bill murray's biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else
<START> i have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie and i understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about whether it be the story line animation dialogue and so forth and i believe the most simple way i can answer to this is that it's a movie for a much much younger age bracket an age bracket much younger than that of totoro my neighbor totoro br br being a miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site i expected the wonderful animation music composition complex story telling the great steady development of characters how the story intertwines with today's society etc etc etc of a typical miyazaki film that we grew up with and to tell you the truth i didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes with twenty minutes left in the movie that this movie is not for the deep thinkers and hard core ghibli but for the toddlers and and happy go lucky japanese people also i believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation straight up grass roots ghibli studios style br br the fact that a villain is not present really surprised me other than the father and maybe that crazy ass typhoon but other than that this movie is just plain fun to stimulate a young one's mind and to make happy good time feeling that's all br br the animation goes back to the old school mid 80s early 90s era of miyazaki's films where very specific detail wasn't a big focus unlike mononoke princess mononoke and the latter i admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when i first watched ghibli movies like totoro when i was a child the reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids and a lot of studio body language is very noticeable studio ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with it's wonderful animators but it probably won't take the ritual ghibli ist in awe br br the japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very very relative from what japanese kids and mothers would say and act the music if very hoppy and fluffy i guess you could say similar to totoro from beginning to end even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive br br in the end this movie is one of a kind just about every aspect of this movie is for children and i waited a whole 80 mins to realize that quite frankly i have never seen a movie told or shown it the way miyazaki did it's refreshing to see that studio ghibli can still tell a story for a wider and much different scale of audience and still keep that trademark ghibli impression
<START> the mountainous woods young happy campers a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure the ingredients are there for a horror delight and director co writer jeff does an adequate job at achieving it it's formulaic woodland horror but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story which is quite basic in a trimmed sense is effectively told in certain realism maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone astray but craftsmanship makes up for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tension moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad very ominously lingering score whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop cinematographers dean m and joel king do a striking job too there's plenty of style abound even with its minimal scope and the build up is slow grinding at times the pacing can become a stop and go affair it's not particularly violent but there's still a mean streak evident even if some of it happens of screen the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killer s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn there's a likable bunch of performances deborah benson makes for a strong dashing heroine gregg henry chris lemmon ralph seymour jamie rose mike and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries the final climax is rather twisted but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinkingÂ is that it br br a well etched backwoods slasher item which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm
<START> a beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire br br physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life br br the one time priest falls deeper in despair and depravity as things turns for worse he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanity br br the vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the twilight and underworld franchises but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire by putting simple things into perspective br br these vampires have reflections and no fangs but still feed and die the same making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts the priest primarily feeds to make himself better but when he meets his friends unfulfilled wife carnal instincts set in br br what makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time they are experiencing something they have never before forbidden passion which makes the scenario all that more sensual br br chan wook adds some much needed humour into the film but this is only realised in the final third of the movie we see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone and when she realises her own strength just puts the chair down and carry on hilarious br br and the final act wouldn't be out of place in a carry on film or even the three stooges as the couple fight for survival death respectively br br cgi is subtle and fantastic and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful you could be watching ballet br br the vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this but more importantly has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days it's violent but from the director in question i wouldn't expect anything different br br a really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography
<START> a really awful movie about a 30 meters long shark bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete a waist of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost even if u liked jaws which i averagely did don't see it even if you have interests in don't see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors corny plots during corny tv time do humanity a favor and do not i repeat do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci fi animal thriller still some people gave it a ten ranting don't know if they were serious or not but sincerely expect they weren't
<START> corey haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to take out a giant troll and osa hit man michael ironside with a 30 30 and homemade bombs which plays plausible considering haim oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend as well in this watchable yet disappointing adaption of a decent story corey haim is terrible of course but the movie's sheer momentum as well as ironside's imposing presence make this at least a modestly effective film still the plot is ridiculous and it would've been nicer if we could've seen a monster or at least more gore at least it's something different also it's fairly likely that this film will be the last teen movie for awhile to show a teenager making pipe bombs br br matt bronson 2 5
<START> this film brought a whole new meaning to that well worn phrase 'like watching paint because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a br br i was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of portugal which i have visited it is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black and white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty that was the only good thing the story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story br br a film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait well a wait is a wait i can wait for a number 15 bus on princes street in edinburgh i can spend hours on a remote railway station in the middle of nowhere on cold winter's sunday afternoon however a wait is boring and yes this wait was boring too br br so the leader goes off to america to with the film supplier who castigates him for not making the whole thing in colour after a number of arguments two blessed bullets ring out from wherever and the eagerly awaited end finally arrives and not before time br br yes i would see this film again if someone arms me with a couple of cans of colour film so that i can hurl them at the screen
<START> this is an enjoyable movie its very realistic to the wonderful world of music i've been there and done that it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect these amateur musicians weren't all that bad players cleavon character marshall tucker was played very well marshall was no saint himself here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there you don't bite the hands that feed you i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has claims he does not know any of the tunes he has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know not common but not unheard of either he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player its not a religion devotion is not enough on that level he is correct although i think the clarinet player could have handled the job he was practicing his butt off and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read very enjoyable movie
<START> i have watched two episodes so far i really like it even though i am no longer in college it makes me miss the wonderful college life i wish that i spent a little more time socializing i kind of identify myself with rusty when i was rushing a fraternity my big brother was not like at all i wish that i had a big brother like him so if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters then it is a pretty good show br br it is more realistic than american pie with less explicit sex jokes can we also call this a younger version of desperate wives some of the writers must be greeks themselves the story seems to reflect somewhat of the real fraternity and sorority life it was shot in high definition and they actually filmed outside instead of inside of studios so the picture quality is very good they could easily make this a good film unlike a movie which can only last a few hours i can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it free on tv weekly br br the casting is excellent the actors are about the right age and they are new and fresh so that makes them more real this show practically is about everyone there are asian and black frat boys and sorority girls in the show as well it is almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the fraternity had sex in first episode then tried to hook up again in the second episode i don't think that i have seen anything like this on tv before this show somehow reminded me about a warner tv show of teenagers called young americans which got canceled in early 2001 in that show a girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy and that guy thought that she was a male homosexual br br greek life can be fun but on the same time students have to study for exams etc by the time when people actually have some free time in their lives there is no fraternity of sorority for them to join any more i don't know how long this show will last sooner or later those people will have to graduate college too maybe they will find some new actors for another 4 years of fun college life
<START> bigfoot movies tend to be bad so i'm not inclined to watch them however there were some good commercials on the sci fi channel so i decided to watch a climbing expedition heads into the pacific northwest to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the expedition's leader played by lance and have brought a revolutionary dna detector that could be used to prove the existence and it actually generates some suspense at first the sasquatch is unseen but sees the mountain body heat like the alien in predator and i did wonder when it was going to strike the acting is passable as is the background music the dense wooded location is well used and when the creature is finally seen the costume is not bad though nothing great but as the film grinds on it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd most of the characters are unpleasant people rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity except for lance character so that it's impossible to care about what happens to them and their behavior become increasingly stupid one man shoots the creature not fatally then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark one female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch without getting her hair and make up messed up then the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the dna detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind a creature knows what threatens it obviously the instinct doesn't apply to these actors or they wouldn't have appeared in this movie and the ending is so stupid you'll want to kick the tv screen if it weren't for the script it would have been a decent horror film
<START> spoilers cash crop goes something like this down on their luck farmers grow pot to make ends meet dea agent blows into town farmers hide the pot dea agent leaves town end of story br br this flick features solid performances by some second tier actors mediocre direction and a so so screenplay but it ain't got no story and since the story is the foundation of every drama cash crop is an utter failure too boring to recommend
<START> i had to read i know why the caged birds sing in my english class and we watched the movie after finishing it after watching the movie i regret seeing it completely took away any of the impact the book had the scenes made no sense in their sequences the acting was horrible and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes instead i was outraged at how the movie ended almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to maya's growth as a person if you have read caged birds this movie will ruin the experience of the book so i warn you not to see it
<START> this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection hilarity truth fun talent and circumstance that make for magic br br from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best if i hadn't have known better i would have thought there was an elaborate script here br br what you get a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity br br peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately the rest of the cast is also phenomenal there are no small parts only small actors and everyone involved here should be patted on the back taken out to dinner and be considered for an oscar br br well done
