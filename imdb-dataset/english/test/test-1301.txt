<START> it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence in fact violence both disturbing and cartoonish is the last of oldboy 's deep flaws the characters are unidimensional underdeveloped primitive the intensity an obsession and a goal in itself with this director is served up with the cheapest of means let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth by the end of the movie it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of horror to continue to shock an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap opera revelations already served up in big bunches it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice cream for the same money be smart homer go for the ice cream
<START> there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will and it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated at the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system br br i saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968 my senior year in high school i went because i like science fiction and wanted to see a space movie remember this film was made before the first moon landing br br there we sat waiting for it to begin but surprise there was no cartoon no coming attractions the theater owner at the cooper theatre for some reason chose to play the star spangled banner with the lights still up so we all stood never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended then the theatre went completely dark and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible br br the overture ended and my seat began to vibrate as the blue screen with the mgm lion appeared along with the first deep bass notes and then my senses were overwhelmed hearing also for the first time in my life the ride had just begun br br i highly recommend you watch this opening this film in a dark room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect i felt in that theatre of course it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science fiction movie intermission came a good thing highly under rated and unused these days and we all looked at each other in wonder caught our breath and then the ride resumed wilder than before br br i saw it 7 more times within the next year always in a real full size theater like all theaters were before multiplexes i might have been high once but i didn't go to see it again and again because i was tripping i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art it was so damn beautiful the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence the sights unimagined and unimaginable the affection for hal turning to terror and of course wtf was kubrick really trying to get across to me years and years and many more viewings later i understand it as well i think as i ever will read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web you'll find explanations that's not my purpose in writing these comments br br what i hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of e g ballet suite or the blue danube savor it like you would a wonderful meal sip it like a fine wine look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that are there and then draw your own conclusions stanley kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you a human came from and where you're headed br br if that's too much work for your brain and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of kubrick's film then pardon my bluntness but your life is about as meaningful as that of a or a pre monolith ape if you want mindless escape this isn't for you br br but if you like sunsets thunderstorms harmonies in music mysteries and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life
<START> i don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll clichÃ© not used in this movie rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you say it to stupid young boys the filmmakers seemed to have read too much or motley crue stories i have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie if you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep just sleep because you must be fresh sober and clean in evenings after live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement then you have a bit time to have fun but its not any luxury or dream artistically this film was zero stupid characters and idiotic dialogs the ending of movie was funny main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band yeah what a moral real 90s
<START> when i first saw this movie i had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset being directed by first time director liev schrieber what i saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind based on the novel by jonathan safran foer everything is illuminated tells the story of a young jewish american collector masterfully played by elijah wood who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis in wwii he travels to germany and enlists in the help of a 20 something club hitting translator and his grandfather this results in a rigid search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for shot in some of the most beautiful countryside in the world everything is illuminated delivers tension between the translator and his grandfather and of the help that jonathan needs to find his quarry there is much religious matter as well as the grandfather refers to jonathan as the jew all in all this is a movie that deals with finding yourself and loving family i give this wonderful if not illuminated movie a 10 out of 10 arjun
<START> i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of '95 piranha back to back with joe dante's '78 original i did the same last week with the omen curiously enough watching the remake right after the '76 original really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons br br but this approach sort of backfired on the '95 piranha version it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture basically the '95 version is more or less the exact same film as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene by scene only steele's character and the military intervention were written out of it but the cinematography wasn't as good the acting was worse too especially alexandra paul playing heather menzies' character showed me again what a horrible actress she is bradford dillman from the '78 version had his charlton heston way of acting going which was amusing while in the '95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt so i didn't mind him really but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen return of the living dead parts 1 2 in a cameo john carl make up effects aren't as neat as rob the musical score had some ring to it but pino score was much more memorable in the original so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re watched the original as part of this double bill br br since scott p remake does follow dante's original i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through though it's lacking the wit dante's original had but what really made me not like version very much is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re used during the piranha attack scenes i never like it when filmmakers do this and i'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons i mean if you don't have the budget or imagination to come up with newly shot material then for pete's sake don't do a frickin' remake but roger corman produced this cheaper remake so i guess i shouldn't be all that surprised about the re use of footage br br if you do decide to watch piranha then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original you might enjoy this remake a little more then and oh yes that cool little stop motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film as to be expected but what's worse there also isn't any female nudity in this one the original really had quite some titty shots going for it and that blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans figures as this '95 version was made for tv
<START> this is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters br br i came across it while switching tv channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him i've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name and have never seen it in the rental stores br br james coburn and slim pickens were excellent in their roles and the rodeo footage was first rate while being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films
<START> my family two 40 somethings an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother saw this at a sneak preview on april 29th we all enjoyed the movie very much the story was a good one and knowing it was based on real life events made it that much more enjoyable luke wilson was a hoot pun intended to watch as was tim blake nelson and seeing neil flynn play something other than the mean janitor from scrubs was nice the kids in movie did well and i'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level the visuals were just lovely and the jimmy buffet music added to the florida feel ok maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults but hey who cares i can't compare it to the book i honestly hadn't heard of it until the movie came out br br it was just a nice movie and it had a good message plain and simple
<START> imdb lists this movie as a comedy i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isn't comedy tragedy maybe br br i won't say whether this is a good movie or not all i know is it is not a comedy i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of someones attachment to some ugly chair br br this movie is not what is advertised it's film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to make people think i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that i know or even that i don't know it's ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoever br br it made me think alright it made me think i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life back br br i'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to them br br i am not one of them
<START> mario from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk i had to go through midnight video who have a swedish branch i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only a title br br this film goes under many a k a's depending on when and where it is marketed i had previously purchased the bloodsucker leads the dance which you will find if you search on imdb under people and input krista nell the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice i smiled when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the in the subject film my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious krista nell br br there are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail extortion sleazy affairs with mothers a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit a by a client's motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by transvestites etc which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word sleaze but artistic sleaze the aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their wheres and personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places e g the scene of the dancing transvestite krista nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and i was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplay br br i love the political incorrectness shown in older films this is 30 years from its making e g smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office i would suggest 4 10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such
<START> 1 if you want to make a movie that deals with social realism it's quite important that the audience identify with the characters that are being portrayed 2 the audience can't identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with situations that are to obvious 3 if you got a bad actor then you can't build any character anyway even if you got nice actors their job will result ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious andalusian accent br br ignores those 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place his script is so predictable a woman comes out of prison she meets his old junkie boyfriend life's tough etc whatever the fact that the story is everything but original wouldn't be that bad if only weren't a complete incompetent writing and filming br br i wonder how long will they keep giving money from our taxes to make movies such as this one br br my rate 3 10
<START> when i first saw the ad for this i was like 'oh here we go he's done high school musical but he can't coast along on that so now he's making appearances on other disney shows' personally i love the suite life and i'm a big fan of ashely but for some reason i'm not too keen on zac although all my friends think he's the best thing since jesse mccartney but he really annoys me anyway i watched the show taking a break from english and was pleasantly surprised the performances were good all round especially from the regular characters on the suite life and zac wasn't as bad as i had anticipated all in all a pretty good show
<START> much better than it is generally given credit for this version of lost horizon not only had great music and beautiful scenery but also some stunning mountain photography a special edition laser disc was released some years ago which added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material extra music and lots of bonus material so why isn't this on dvd hard to figure the studios out sometimes certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than peter finch liv ullman george kennedy and sally kellerman but what do you want in a movie good acting or melodious pipes song and dance man bobby van is great fun michael york is a suitably tragic villain and seeing sir john gielgud decked out as chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen trust me you need to check this movie out if you can find it
<START> ok so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be or whether they're from a foreign country all that aside one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be the jokes are a good mix of slapstick a la bobcat goldthwait surreal bobcat under the inspired direction of steve holland and dry john cusack one of the most dry and funny actors in american cinema and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line ok except demi moore br br yes it's immature yes it's screw ball yes bobcat dresses up like godzilla and trashes a scale model of a seafood restaurant it's also funny as hell watch it
<START> does anybody know why this movie is called the couch trip i was just watching it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite dan aykroyd performance it even beats out his ghostbusters performance i had never heard of the movie before i seen it in a sears store i read the back and thought it sounded good so i bought and when i finally got a chance to watch it i thought it was better than what i had originally expected this movie rates as good as animal house and national lampoon's vacation in my mind i wish comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happens in it and the bad stuff that does happen are also funny parts if anyone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it email me at hotmail com
<START> in this silly symphony a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table the animation is fine where this short suffers is in a lack of humor perhaps i've just seen this dinner table adventure in one too many tom and jerry shorts even though this came first i just didn't find it that enjoyable
