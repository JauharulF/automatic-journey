<START> yeah i watched this mini series with my mom and dad as a kid it was one of the few mini series that my 9 year old mind actually could follow i recall it was very well done and didn't necessarily have the feel of the typical crap mini series it was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention i would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable it is still worth the time i haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet however i would imagine not they should play it on the history channel or something
<START> describing this film is a difficult task on the one hand it's an over the top vampire spookfest complete with cobwebs eerie music a hypnotic medallion and of course a coffin with a creaky lid br br on the other hand this is one of the silliest scripts this side of edward d wood jr produced by the same people who gave us the bloody vampire invasion of the vampires and this film's predecessor the modestly titled the vampire the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films br br as i mentioned this film is a sequel to the vampire which i have not seen but no matter it's real easy to imagine what happened dr enrique played by abel the brainiac salazar is befuddled when the well intentioned but misguided dr marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy count de i suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counts of some sort dr marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies and he hopes to use the vampire's corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of a normal reflection at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection we see the vampire's skeleton br br enrique is not pleased and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition this man was no vampire i'll admit that he liked to drink a little blood but that's all he states also confusing matters is the fragile martha a part time nurse and part time showgirl who happens to be object of affection martha narrowly escaped de clutches in the first film and apparently enrique has spent a great deal of time healing her mind and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real br br ok so if you were the scriptwriter for this film you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire right well how about the greedy con man who helped marion steal the coffin after getting a glimpse de body he sets his sights on the expensive looking brooch that the count is wearing and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren't looking but darn it he can't remove the brooch because of the stake so you guessed it de is on the loose again this time with the shady con as his human henchman br br ok so of course the vampire is after martha again and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe at first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all points bulletin out for a man who is dead but still alive br br you can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists one of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum is there any other kind in these types of films complete with a fully equipped torture chamber with real torture and execution equipment the movie has a very keen sense of style and not just in the campy cobwebs one effectively creepy sequence has de chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a german expressionist nightmare the cabinet of dr caligari seems to be an influence br br but the rest of the film is juvenile particularly in the film's climax the special effects are quite crude even for the year that this was made and the climactic fight with de in bat form is laughable enough but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray right at that very minute what an unfortunate coincidence to make matters worse he cuts away from the rope to scenes of enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat basically standing still and waving his arms around it's definitely an ed wood moment if ever there was one especially when martha seems to revive on her own and rises to her feet just as the blade slams down whew what a relief in terms of kookiness the vampire's coffin does not have the lunacy factor of the bloody vampire or invasion of the vampires but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to count for something haw haw
<START> this movie is just as bad as it gets if you like logic or the lack of it la national treasure and bad acting as well then it could be a movie for you br br otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer br br actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved ie actors special effects and so on they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent br br in a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product br br it is really lousy
<START> terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion you knew what to expect and ain't that just so typical unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots this show is still a breath of fresh air how lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family perpetually late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers and therein is the secret terry june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of today's strained plots with the 'de dysfunctional family made to look hip br br personally i vote the bridge to far episode as one of the best in a way terry's antics reminds me of basil fawlty both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing br br terry june comes highly recommended have your tea and biscuits ready
<START> i really really liked this one i know it's rampant with what are now clichÃ© plot lines and plenty of overacting but it was hell of a lot of fun br br in our quest for 70's and 80's horror cheese we come across many flicks that are so bad they're good we also have some that are so 'good' they suck and then we have some that are so bad they are just bad this is definitely so bad it's good br br some teens traveling come across an in the middle of nowhere a forgotten slice of roadside america and they decide to 'check it out ' they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it they pay dearly br br i would not normally give a movie like this a 9 but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970's ditzy scantily clad and fit these aren't the anorexic broads from today's horrible horror they look awesome in booty shorts br br i give it a 9 out of 10 kids
<START> i originally seen the flash gordon serial on pbs and thought it was fun and awesome i overlooked the special effects of the rocket ships with sparklers and the big dragon monster with lobster claws who cares this is 1936 and it was a serial so each week they would show a new chapter buster crabbe played flash gordon 3 times in all 3 serials then in 1939 he played buck rogers in 1933 he played tarzan the fearless he was a very busy actor beautiful jean rogers played sexy dale arden frank shannon as professor and charles middleton played the evil ming the merciless he makes darth vader look like a boyscout the serials were very close to the alex raymond comic strip space travel was just a pipe dream at the time not to mention ray guns and television this one stands out as the best serial ever the sequel flash gordon's trip to mars is 2 chapters longer the next flash gordon conquers the universe is only 12 chapters and then there's the natives of hawk men lion men shark men the feature version leaves out the shark men scenes for the full effect you must see the complete serial i heard george lucas was inspired by flash gordon when he did star wars flash gordon was from universal studios and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal movies like bride of frankenstein werewolf of london dracula's daughter etc even today flash gordon continues to delight people young and old 10 out of 10
<START> i'm watching this film as i write this it's about 45 minutes into the film and there's been so much back and forth and empty drama i don't quite see where it's going no facts just enough to leave you making assumptions the acting of main daughter is painful how did this ever get made not the best of lifetime films
<START> forgiving the is the best film i have seen in years the acting was fantastic especially mari blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of peggy lester she brought peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next door neighbor i also enjoyed robertson dean in the role of the father he is a true professional and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace the performances by the entire cast were very good excellent in fact but peggy's role as played by blackwell made the movie the cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive the only criticism i have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes which were overly drawn out repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character i would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness but spite of that slight flaw it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it
<START> the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century and a half before you'd think that with a title like miner's massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge but instead i got terrestrial twenty somethings fornicating and in one case defecating in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity
<START> the concorde is for now the last of the high drama high camp airport series at first glance in the tv guide or dvd cover you would simply think that the film your about to view is as thrilling as the previous think again what your treated to is 2 hours and 3 minutes worth of unintentional laughs courtesy of the worst script ever writing it was even penned by eric roth who brought the world gump well one things for sure the script is not oscar worthy it's razzie worthy the executives at universal in '79 done the right thing by marketing this as a 'comedy' apart from charo the film does have an impressive cast list it's certainly watchable to say the least
<START> most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat it's just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children can't stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this see a good movie br br 1 10 stars the lowest review i have ever given a movie
<START> this is a film by the director of the notorious in the realm of the senses a film so sexually and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while this film takes place initially in 1895 in japan and stars the very pretty yoshiyuki as the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind that man comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her though she soon is rather willing to be seduced soon they are having an affair and plot to kill husband to be together forever they do and throw him down a well however they didn't count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting and others in the village this film is visually very stunning the use of shadows highlighting this tale of murder for passion ms yoshiyuki who is still active as an actress is especially very good in her role its sexual at times but not like in the realm of the senses some of what ensues is up to our imagination i found this film to have a consistency of mood that makes it very watchable a little creepy but that goes with the territory i'd recommend this
<START> watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co starred the two of them other than that i can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence not that it isn't amusing in spots it certainly is but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted br br the thing that really got me was eddie murphy's character i can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs but i can't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield i mean can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy not the screen version just to get a day job br br anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer he's undercover and murphy is part of his backup so what does the showboating murphy do he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action br br so deniro's bust gets blown sky high but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro's case with all the tv cameras around br br eddie murphy's a funny guy i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies but he's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has br br i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film
<START> great job was very exciting and had great stunts a show that really rocked was a great job by all who worked on this one and especially the acting on bobbie phillips' part this would have been great on the big screen would like to see more of these movies of the week or perhaps a weekly series this was great entertainment and am glad i watched by far the best of the three keep up the good work upn and bobbie phillips i'll be looking for the next one
<START> this bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things i've ever seen on tv unlike me first the gimme the worlds foremost punk cover band the dan band really must be seen to be appreciated br br on paper the dan band is just a one joke act guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics if you listen to their dan band live cd that's all you'll get and it'll get old quick i only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the tv special but what's made dan finnerty a hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence this guy owns his audience for every second he's onstage and the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well as for the actual band they stay out of sight for the most part but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical lounge act backing band hopefully a dvd version will be released soon there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censoring adds a bit of unintentional humor it also removes the intentional humor br br if there is any sense in the world the vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build dan his own showroom faster br br re member my name fame
