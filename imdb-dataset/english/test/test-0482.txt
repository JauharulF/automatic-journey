<START> stars hayden br br there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot and this one is just a poor rehashing of it white girl moves to ethnic school doesn't fit in soon becomes accepted originality is nonexistent in this and neither are the laughs it uses so many old poorly executed jokes it's annoying i don't know why they think it's a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films but it isn't with that said the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses br br my rating out of pg 13 for language and sexual humor
<START> it's a super movie i only seen it once but it's very good if you like music like in and don't have problem with drugs it's fantastic movie it's only a little bit to short but when you watch the movie make sure your sound system is at 100 then you will love the music in the film and the funny things that a guy from the country comes never drink any alcohol and then he is under drugs in the biggest and love the music br br the only problem is that i want to buy it and i can't find it so if anyone knows where i could buy the movie pleas mail me br br greets me from holland br br pleas reply me
<START> this is without a doubt one of the most accomplished debut films for any director the movie is only 90 minutes long but manages to say just about everything about life and death not much action and dialogue is minimal but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on the performances by the leads are perfection and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes the movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience but this is one that everyone ought to see refreshingly unsentimental and honest this is on par with ozu's works br br scratch my title this one is perfect
<START> i have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one i really can't come up with one i think it's because most of the films that take on this topic war peace violence are in a fixed documentary style there are some terrific ones out there all of them better known than usa t m i'm sure but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means this dvd in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't it is philosophical maybe but it bypasses the information mode and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does it makes you feel but sometimes you don't even know why you are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling when you watch it notice how well it is put together it may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who look for a rare cinematic creation that respects you
<START> really is this necessary how can somebody make such a film disgusting seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant stunts all the time cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack not to mention the ending completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl br br steven seagal wants to be robin hood well at the beginning a fortune teller answers something nobody has asked seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future they must be kidding steven segal passes out after a car persecution and i know he can't act it was terrible nothing can save that film br br i lost 90 minutes of my life see you
<START> i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could find this awful lazy poorly written abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been great what a shame that all that acting talent the sets the props the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned br br there is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here like those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world casino royale where the stars are just mugging for each other and 'having a great time' which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothing br br i could have written a better who send up in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year 10 in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates it was better i look at it now and the gags are funnier steven moffat you are a no talent bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity makes me want to cry
<START> after seeing undisputed 2 i knew what to expect from isaac florentine br br the shepherd border patrol is a decent flick not van damme's best but definitely not his worst there is some bad acting from supporting cast but it makes sense br br the storyline and plot has all been done before so it's nothing new i mean this is van damme we don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we so lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fighting br br without giving anything away i thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of recent movies such as second in command in which the entire end fight is horrible with florentine behind the camera and if you've seen undisputed 2 he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it a few of the fights in the shepherd reminded me of older stuff which is what we all want to see the fights were good and i said hah awesome out loud a few times but i was hoping for just a bit more considering how good i thought undisputed 2 was br br something i found intriguing was daughter in the film i thought wow she's kinda hot come to find out its bianca van real life daughter i have never seen her before so that was a nice treat br br all in all this movie is not half bad yeah the story has been done before but at least jc was attempting to make a good movie next time though add more hand to hand combat i think he still has what it takes to do another big budget movie his acting has improved since he's been doing and he really is in great shape at 47 i don't know about you but i'm one of the ones who thinks that most of his are actually good with the exception of derailed all he needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape and make a martial arts movie and i think people would respond well even though he's not jet li this movie is definitely worth the rental
<START> many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us that is the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it it was winter here in australia 1992 when i had seen batman returns at the cinemas and it blew me away both me's i was supposed to belong to an ideal a standard but at the same time i was living another life tim burton was the first film maker to say its ok for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all after tim burton's batman interpretations many other dark comic book heroes and anti heroes flooded the cinemas comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive but what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes you snap somewhere in your psyche your young tender psychological make up breaks apart the only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona you make a promise your other self will be stronger harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal those criminals any criminal this is life seen through bruce wayne's eyes both pairs the world he sees is dark gloomy and cold although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by they don't rush out to get his autograph he is their saviour not the winner of a personality contest batman returns is about losers batman for yet another christmas remains the only lonely man beast in town bruce wayne never gets to arrest the vile max the penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of gotham and selina kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized and the hero doesn't get the girl or cat this movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong to have a home as expressed by bruce wayne and oswald cobblepot the film brings out a need in all of us to be heard respected and not ignored as desired by selina kyle oswald and of course bruce wayne but sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another we are told to be an ideal to behave to a certain standard that is until we finally snap only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see catwoman rise towards the night sky but come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women as for me i cant say that i will reach a point where i will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled but thats ok we all have a dark side batman returns is not only the best of the batman films it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling
<START> betty is as an in a production of verdi's macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident however in the grand tradition of the scottish play the production seems cursed with problems not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew unfortunately for betty the killer seems to have special plans for her br br this is one of several must see argento mad slasher flicks in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor i haven't measured it but i reckon around two thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans tracking or cranes the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller the imagery is wild and dizzying closeups of the heroine's eyes forced open with nails a swooping glide around an opera house from a point of view shots of the killer's brain squirming a bullet fired through a peephole a swallowed chain dug out of a victim's trachea conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director the movie isn't without some shortcomings though the cast are variable at best and are both a bit shaky and his dubbing in the english version is appalling even by italian standards although argento regular is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique the material is a nice three way mix of the phantom of the opera shakespeare and slasher flick scripted by argento and his usual collaborator franco with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what's actually going on full of all sorts of different music brian claudio bill wyman and of course verdi the scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the in for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera
<START> the movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age timid appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to rome and sing as a diva matthew objects but comes along he connects with the young girl again but this time matt is on cocaine his superb voice lovely impetuous mother is in the limelight she doesn't know how to handle matt's addiction the movie drags on in search of a plot clayburgh is in the wrong role and bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture the moon has great symbolism br br save your time i am perhaps overly generous with 4
<START> i loved this movie not as great as 50 first dates but it's definitely a especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends yes the plot was cute and maybe even unbelievable but what's so bad about a feel good movie drew as josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling with all the junk out there what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy without being embarrassed while watching with your kids drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part this is definitely one of her best roles
<START> is one of most political movies it takes stance strongly against modern day society's authority status in the life of the common man and how it has estranged men from the nature completely it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society br br smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland only to realize that the concept of a 'free country' isn't all that unambiguous in other words the society has the common man by the balls br br still the thing that makes so exceptional besides the visual and brilliance is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the 70's as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation is like an archetype of a classical finn in his and social since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes emotionally exceptionally moving
<START> i was living in ca in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane played an poor attempt of bonnie and clyde needless to say it never went over well maybe this is why it never made it to video even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie the movie was dull and pretty much pointless by the way dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down
<START> i thought this film was a poor effort by the british film council fell flat as hey come on tim robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context it's a good looking film but lacks punch when tim robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small migraine he looks uncomfortable and life less the part where he is screening suspect employees at sphinx is laughable if an investigator came to my factory the last thing i would do is tell him about my freckle fetish it's obviously over intellectual clumsy the city is as it is a convenient backdrop they obviously picked the most futuristic city they could shanghai as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner where the characters of the city often intersect the story slow as a wet week no chemistry real dramatic high points so so plot
<START> when i saw alien vs predator a few years ago i have to say as stupid as a sequel it was it was still somewhat enjoyable now there are unfortunately a shortage of good movies out in the theater lately so my boyfriend and i decided to just go ahead and see what aliens vs predator requiem was about so we saw it a couple nights ago and i have to say that there was absolutely nothing thrilling about this horror sequel it took a completely different turn from the first movie it's not a bad idea that they took alien and predator and put them in the up class suburbs but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing this was just an average and predictable horror sequel not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where i wasn't sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why so i couldn't really keep up with the story br br from what i've gathered of course the predator and the alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors they're just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not go ahead and take it out on some earthlings so they crash and alien is taking over the suburbia utopia but teenagers including a troubled couple who look like ken and barbie a female marine and her daughter among others are going to make sure to kick some space butt that is if the predator doesn't get there first because he is ticked off at the alien i guess for starting the party without him lol just kidding actually for killing some of his friends br br aliens vs predator requiem isn't the worst movie by any standards it's still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between alien and predator are so cool to watch like the first sequel of alien vs predator the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed i know it's horror but the original alien and predator films had characters that you cared about and wanted to win but it was a semi decent sequel that i would say is worth a look for some fun especially for ken and sake br br 4 10
