<START> after reading some of these reviews it is apparent that some have missed the point what is great about this film here comes the point what is incredible about this film what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing there is no preaching there is no preaching there is no preaching life goes on it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self these are just kids doing what kids do without consciousness we all went to school with kids like these we are being numbed by fiction movie tv news based reality invention br br dennis hopper the great girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie br br there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film amen br br
<START> i saw this film at the 2005 edinburgh international film festival br br this film had been compared in the program to sideways which i liked so i was quite looking forward to this movie i also liked garden state napoleon dynamite etc so i have had good recent experiences with slightly weird american indy films br br unfortunately i found that puffy chair does not compare favourably with any of these movies br br i was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing witty insightful or even mildly interesting to happen it didn't and the shaky video cam was making me sick so i left br br this is only the second film i have ever walked out from the first was showgirls which is slightly disappointing i probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the wobbly picture but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that i would be missing anything br br disappointing
<START> i've seen this movie at least 8 times and i still laugh every time the movie is about how an intelligent and motivated man against all odds can cheat the entire over self confident system br br this movie is for all people who like a funny movie br br the action and comedy is well mixed into a brilliant film that i hope to see on dvd soon br br
<START> i agree with all aforementioned comments this show was a delight to watch funny witty terrific acting and zany sets it's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor i would spend good hard earned cash money to see it again on dvd and as long as we're requesting smart series that never got a chance how about dvd releases of maximum bob another well written odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters and add to the list middle ages or frank's place there has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences
<START> there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesn't even hold up as made for cable porn in fact heaven's tears is completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a car the bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert films then on their second or third meeting get this he is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girl's sexual advances and yet all she has to say is i'm old enough i'm want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and he'd have lived a full life it's like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentary br br the cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girl's bed very fake looking as if it's on a stage and it's with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall the i am completed scene is just a close up of the girl's right side head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and it's the same shot for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazi's older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him she's ridiculous and silly so it doesn't matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and it's neither enlightening nor arousing
<START> i've always enjoyed frank sinatra's music and just recently i wrote a term paper about his life story i've been fascinated by the life and legend of ol' blue eyes however i've never seen any of his movies so i wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing well it was i was blown away by his performance in this movie he really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict frankie machine who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band br br otto preminger's direction is great as well i haven't seen any of his other movies i read his biography on the imdb he seems like one of those directors who was sorely misunderstood and people had conflicted thoughts about him seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult enthusiasts i haven't seen enough of his films to know for sure if he's really brilliant but now i'm curious i want to see more of his films because judging by his attempt with the man with the golden arm this guy has talent i also loved the music for this movie the score definitely contains the kind of music that i'll remember if i ever happen to hear it again that's when you know you have a great score br br the supporting performances are fine as well including darren mcgavin as the local drug pusher eleanor parker as frankie's wheelchair bound wife and kim novak as his lover br br it's interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse as opposed to modern attempts in films like trainspotting and requiem for a dream back in 1955 just mentioning the word drugs caused controversy and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very discreet level there's only one scene where frankie is actually getting heroin injected into his arm and they showed a close up of the reaction of his face rather than showing the needle graphically poking into his veins but it delivered its message without making it feel watered down in a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this you don't need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued br br the man with the golden arm is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out it really is an amazing piece of work br br my score 8 out of 10
<START> this film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to the everglades along with another couple and the family dog when they first get there they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week after with the old man three also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave after asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer they find the cabin after they settle in strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end adding a church group did not make the story any better then at the end the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun lame thats what this movie is
<START> this surrealistic absurdist movie is the first film i have seen of cult swedish director roy he is a veteran filmmaker who has made his living filming commercials directing only four feature films in the last forty years this background shows the film seems like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials there is no story interconnecting these vignettes though some characters appear in more than one vignette there is a theme throughout underneath them though the absurdity of modern life some of the film's mannerisms having the actors appear in light white makeup are more irritating than illuminating some of the skits amount to very little a man unsure in which queue to stand other skits are better though the best is the one about the rock chick dreaming that she goes on honeymoon with her rock guitarist bride on a house that turns on something akin to a train you have to watch it to get it a film worth seeing even if comparisons made by some film critics with such great filmmakers as keaton tati and seems overwrought lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story interconnecting the vignettes is fatal to this film's pretension of being a masterpiece
<START> i saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the dpp video nasty list and while i'm glad i saw it because it's now 'another video nasty down' on its own merits andy milligan's film really isn't worth bothering with there are of course far worse films on the infamous list but that doesn't make the pain of viewing this one any easier the film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget and that has translated into the script as blood rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema and doesn't do anything new with it basically the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will it's not long before they start getting picked off blah blah blah for most of the film nothing happens and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned they're so amateurish and silly that they're impossible to take seriously on any level it's a very good thing that this movie doesn't have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture it all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending which also succeeds in being a non event of epic proportions apparently this movie is still banned here in the uk but somehow i doubt it's because of its shock value basically blood rites isn't worth seeing and i personally can see no reason to recommend it unless of course you've made it your business to see everything on the video nasty list
<START> the fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact all its own if you dislike it so much don't watch it br br certain reviewers assert that you have to be dumb dim witted or plain old primitive to enjoy this show au contraire my friends i am not claiming that all the contestants are smart there are smart ones and there are dumb ones but i would argue that they probably have a higher average iq than the average reviewer on this website thats right i said it there is a lot to be said for the science of seducing girls i'm sorry but please withdraw all sticks out of your asses and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you br br those oblivious to social sciences and more specifically the science behind mating are clearly going to miss the boat completely br br one thing is clear the clubs aren't the only places to meet girls i personally think that the worthwhile women don't even go to clubs so that they won't fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show but what are men like these apart from the ones whose games stink they are the epitome of men they are men who meet women in the most difficult situations these are men who take ownership of their own sexuality these men don't beg for their girlfriends to not break up with them and these men don't say ok to the phrase let's just be friends br br sound familiar in fact these are the very guys you're afraid of when you take your special long term girlfriend to the club we all are these guys know what women like again only the ones who have game br br and even the ones who are bad they are worth a laugh br br if you have gone out to a club and actually interacted with the people around you you should find this show entertaining br br look i am at a loss for why there is so much hate for this show my best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs or threatens men who believe women are beautiful self less creatures who just want a nice guy to buy their attention br br i personally love this show it is pure entertainment and best of all its real it is a very perceptive take on the most recent state of sexual psychology sex roles have never been so different from before and this show provides a very real view of that br br i think it actually takes some intelligence to take away something positive from this show br br this show appeals to a certain target market and if you're outside of that then i guess you shouldn't tune in to the show we could say this about any other shows though couldn't we br br grow up br br
<START> if you're coming to this film to learn something about depression forget it you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject i understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck but the result is the most one dimensional character i've ever seen in a hollywood feature no small feat christina ricci as elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs viciously insulting someone bursting into tears or some combination of the three the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end there is not the slightest hint of what she might be like without depression not the faintest glimmer of any other aspects of her personality she just screams at one point her roommate tells her lizzie you're such a fun person to be around when you're not being depressed and my reaction was she is it seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples but this script is a lesson in incompetence it has no discernible structure or flow at all instead it consists of a series of awkwardly strung together scenes of lizzie screaming then ends character development no scenes of her everyday existence i e going to classes that might possibly be important details no screaming at maximum volume check it's not quite enough i'm afraid 1 10
<START> i recalled watching this program as a young boy in australia in the 60s and enjoyed it on dvd again as a 50 year old father of young kids although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a component of violence i am very happy to have my 6 and 8 year old kids watch this because the central characters are deep kind and honourable the japanese culture shines through the violence is not gory nobody glories in it and the program is beautiful to watch it does not promote nightmares but instead it shows much of the culture that must have primarily influenced the design of jedi knights in star wars br br the quality of the dvds does leave something to be desired video will not like this one it is strongly reminiscent of something held on 16mm film and projected onto the wall in some basement which it may well be the soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we have come to expect from home theatre however my kids noticed only that it was not in colour and i suspect they only noticed that because we had been talking recently about how old things are often like that the beauty of mt fuji is evident even in b w something about the 17th century setting makes the quality part of the atmosphere as if you peer into the past through some time window br br overall this program is better than most things on the air and a far better advertisement for japanese tv than pokemon but you may consider it of marginal value if you did not have the experience of seeing it back in the 60s my score of 8 10 takes its age into account
<START> ok the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem i e the story started out in life as material for buster keaton's silent classic 7 chances comedy or acting in any genre for that much is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before if it's not a totally original creation here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget short time span of a film they're handling things just fine regardless of what the credits say on their films real stooge philes know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation words spoken by emil sitka himself during a documentary about the boys here what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married is actually organized chaos every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action how many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i've seen in the last 35 years of watching tv the critics will always pooh pooh the stooges or laurel hardy and others but then again who ever remembers the critic's names or what they said simply watch laugh and enjoy
<START> i saw this movie one time at a kiddie matinÃ©e at the north park theater in san diego in 1959 when it was released and i was 11 it was one of three features that were shown that day br br i have not seen it since but have wanted to because i am a film buff and appreciate the terrible along with the great good and average films br br what i remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members consisting of children between 8 and 15 howled with laughter at the tree monster br br a triple bill at a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget but i can't remember the names of the other 2 films one did star george montgomery and david farrar br br update the other 2 films in this triple bill were much better they were 1959 with george montgomery and david farrar starring and the angry red planet 1959 with gerald mohr and naura hayden staring ms hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness also
<START> ho humm more of nothing if you are a long time rush fan you know what this video contains loathsome songs from the past the big 3 hits from the 80's and their last ditch efforts to remain contemporary they do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as dinosaurs unfortunately they fail at protecting themselves from embarrassment close ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys have been br br if you are have been following as much as you can stomach the band for a couple of decades from the 70's then you know there is no new material here same old same old 1 neil avoids the press 2 no real behind the scenes geddy looses his shoes give me a break even he thinks it's absurd 3 no new insights br br a better video would have been to show the crew setting up for 3 or 4 hours Â just let the camera run and stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds i understand the director wants to try to do something artsy but then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the viewer can choose we know what the band looks like Â let us see what we really want to see br br do yourself a big favor rent this movie first
