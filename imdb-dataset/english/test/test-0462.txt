<START> okay first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget with that in mind it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher but still br br after giving it a chance it still violated some basic film making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed a lot br br think blair witch in a car but really boring br br think you left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour then making your friends watch it br br the scariest part possible spoiler alert if spoiling here is possible was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again scary br br silliness aside this is a pretty good idea for a low budget lets go make a movie tonight film but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad and let's just say it wasn't really good there were just too many parts where nothing happened at first i thought that was the director's plan you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening but no br br i kept trying to find good things to say about it and i had plenty of time to think and i'll say the music was kinda cool and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really really long time but that's it the actors playing infected people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from mib chances are if for some strange reason you're going to watch this movie it's on dvd or tivo so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficult br br i hate to be so critical of something but at the same time i've watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff it might be decent maybe that'll be the director's cut
<START> direct to video is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless its a direct to video sequel to something that went direct to video in the first place despite this studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct to video sequels over the years to cult hits i don't think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time including the hitcher ii starship troopers 2 and cruel intentions 3 it's fitting that road house 2 was helmed by scott as he was also the man in charge of ruining the cruel intentions series like his entry in the cruel intentions trilogy takes elements that made the first road house a great guy flick and rehashes them with no success whatsoever this is no sequel this is a remake all the way various lines from the original are repeated plot points cut and pasted and scenes are replicated almost shot for shot from the first one the one thing that could not be duplicated were the amazing fight scenes which made road house what it was here we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour compare that with its predecessor's fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of earth vs the spider but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess it's not completely his fault as the screenplay is very very poorly written and clunky i don't care if something goes direct to video a good script is still required someone should keep that mind while continuously churning these low budget direct to dvd movies out skip it entirely 1 10
<START> what starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent unscary incompetently made stupid attempted horror films of recent years br br absolutely terrible it's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of fulci's gates of hell br br the worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump to be avoided
<START> well i set out with a few friends to see this movie we went an hour before the show started to get good seats so as you can probably imagine we where exited to see this movie but that excitement soon turned to horror this movie is a complete failure it just try's to hard to be funny that its sad the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it br br the only good acting in the whole movie was from stefan c schaefer who was great the plot was weak and even the funny scenes felt forced and unnatural considering that the main actors are some of best comedians it's well special br br i would not recommend this movie to any one because it try's to hard and never really delivers
<START> many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isn't realistic how can it not be considered realistic they feel that say the incest part isn't easy to relate to that it isn't common i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur many of them aren't going to come out and say it and mostly these are victims also many people are gay and are still in the closest because no matter how much they would like it to be they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned and tell me how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder i bet a lot and although pregnancy isn't from incest most of the time its still easy to relate to who can't relate to being an outcast or being bullied that happens all the time and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as marcus being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to so there are a lot of things to relate to more than the rest though no matter how popular you may get sometimes you feel invisible or alone not noticed or overlooked such as the suicide victim how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie i find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others but i would like to think of it as important it an interesting way of showing that suicide happens and to be aware it comes from the people that don't show their unhappy thoughts its very surprising the people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to but when you hear of suicide who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds br br the ending surprised me i wasn't expecting it to be the girl that until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes not even introduced the story even in its description says its about 6 teenage lives when in fact it was 7 my only real disappointment was that it wasn't one of the characters that we got to learn about it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick until i thought more it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise since thats what suicides are like plus who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other br br though this movie has some bad points most movies have a few but i would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this film
<START> somehow somewhere someplace you gotta see this film breath taking and incredible outstanding performances from highly gifted actors you think du soleil blows your mind wait till you see what these 2 women do most importantly the emotional journey and struggles jane weber faces are universal in theme to many women a superbly directed film which deals with the complexities of relationships and holding on until you're ready to let go this masterpiece will touch women and men alike ned far director writer and ridiculously talented weber star producer just had the guts to tell it honestly and sincerely this film will hit big see it however you can or you won't be in the loop when it becomes one of the most talked about films
<START> this is a hard movie to come by in the us but if you can find it and you're interested in the life and music of percy aldridge grainger you're in for a treat it's quite historically accurate richard grainger looks astoundingly like grainger at this period in time emily karen is quite a bit prettier than the real karen but that was an inaccuracy i was happy to discover i think what really struck me though was how well captured outrageous personality barbara hershey's rose was also a treasure if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period it is more than made up for in how well she captured rose's obsession with percy it's an easy film to recommend i should note that when she saw passion my wife had no particular affinity for or knowledge of grainger and his music but she was totally captivated by the film
<START> as a rule i try to find as much in films as i possibly can to enjoy them i made no exceptions with tart doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was but no effort no matter how great could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie br br it failed for a number of reasons firstly the cinematography was directionless and ineffective secondly the script reached depths of 'poor' that took it well and truly beyond the 'so bad it's good' category thirdly the acting left mind blowing amounts to be desired it was appalling it really was anyone who saw mischa barton seen here as the remarkably terrible grace a character so poorly invented and realised that ja ja binks doesn't seem so bad as devon in john lawn dogs will wonder what went wrong between then and now perhaps had she been given a character worth bothering with and a modicum of direction she at least might have given this film one redeeming feature alas such was not the case finally the film seemed to have no point whatsoever expressing nothing achieving nothing really i wonder why christina wayne bothered br br tart made a feeble attempt to be something and failed the result a film sadly so bad that it's just very very bad don't bother it really isn't worth it
<START> this is one of the periphery stories told by the animatrix that isn't directly relevant to the war stopping one glorifying plot of the films but trinity voiced by carrie does appear in it it features a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker named trinity we see his search which features other pis only one who he meets who has seemingly gone mad from his own experience trying to track trinity down eventually he makes contact with trinity who he assumes to be a man of course told in the narrative and something that firmly puts us in his own perspective despite what we already know on a hacker chat room and solves a riddle which forces him in a hurry to catch a train he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws it to him in a moment of ludicrousness so absurd it's hilarious br br he meets her on the train but the ruse is thereby revealed when agents attack the agents were using him to get to trinity and trinity was trying to free the pis sent after her which he doesn't know of course and which isn't explicitly stated in the animation itself something common to film noir titles which often hint at plenty of interesting back story subplots developments etc but don't show you more then the core story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue br br almost everything in this short is in black and white the music is reminiscent of film noir and the offbeat old fashioned yet dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist for a film noir title the trivia section of this title's entry on imdb also helpfully presents a few references this title makes to hardboiled literature something it also borrows heavily from a genre of mysteries for detectives gangsters etc who engage in challenging conflicts readily and often animated aptly by studio 4Â°c and directed by watanabe it is an enjoyable variant on the usual matrix story
<START> this has one of the more unusual plots i've seen in a horror film but it's based on good solid universal studios fare lots of monsters pretty heroine torch bearing villagers but my favorite part is larry talbot the wolf man searching for the cure for his lycanthropy after dying in the original wolf man he is resurrected and wanders through frankenstein meets the wolf man and house of frankenstein searching for a way to end his affliction i think first time viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interesting br br
<START> i wish hollywood would make more movies like the china syndrome because this one scores on every level br br it has an intelligent believable script it shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself but the money involved in it that causes danger and the movie also gives you a great behind the scenes look of how television is made br br it scores as a thriller the first time i saw it it kept me right on the edge of my seat and it scores as a character movie i really cared for the main characters jane fonda michael douglas wilford brimley and most of all jack lemmon are great
<START> michael radford the director of the merchant of venice makes a tremendous job in opening the play as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this thorny account of a horrible time in history the luscious production of the shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the venice of the xvi century br br this is a story of revenge prejudice and justice as imagined by william shakespeare having seen the play a few times we were not prepared about what to expect mr radford takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone also he has used a version of english that makes more sense rather than relying on the original text in fact the way shylock speaks in the film doesn't shock at all being he a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the venetian authorities and the catholic church br br al pacino tremendous portrayal of shylock shows a man that is vulnerable arrogant mean and totally human all at the same time mr pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality his own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be caving in on him at the end of the film we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule by everyone br br lynn collins as is a happy discovery having seen her in lighter fare she not only surprises but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera she shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend who risked his own well being in trying to help get hand br br jeremy irons plays antonio the man who seeks shylock for a bridge loan after all he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon antonio gets much more than he bargained for in agreeing with shylock to the terms of the loan antonio's best laid plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations mr irons gives a subtle performance br br joseph fiennes makes a good appearance as his good looks and his charm make an impression on who clearly sees a soul mate in this young venetian as she knows he is the one for her also in smaller roles kris marshall robinson charlie cox contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience br br ultimately it's mr triumph because of the vision he gives us of venice and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind
<START> this film is so bad it's hilarious i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy although i couldn't quite work out if they were actually taking the p ss or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent i notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious it's basically seems to be about a gang of who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine one scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads then showing each other 'get out of jail cards that they've made also check out vinnie jones' accent where the hell is he meant to be from oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these skinned b the guy who wrote and directed it a pee wee herman lookalike with a beard and an orange tan has for some reason cast himself in the lead role maybe this is part of the joke i don't know actually the more i think about it the more i'm sure this film is a p ss take it's produced by quentin tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh it is a total rip off of tarantino's style but just done really really badly it is very amusing though and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic either from being an amusing parody of the tarantino rodriguez style or something that is very very unintentionally funny has to be seen to be believed
<START> i looked forward to spending part of my independence day weekend watching a good film about jefferson this film was not it it was rather long drawn out dull and unbalanced too much time was spent exploring relationship with and not enough time was spent on his relationship with sally hemmings the lady who played sally thandie newton was absolutely awful her acting was so bad it was like watching an a1 airhead trying to recite shakespeare her constant whining voice grated the nerves nolte's accent made jefferson sound like an ignorant man rather than a genius relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery was also underdeveloped yet his eldest daughter's rebellion patsy is a key event late in the film the film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement on the positive side the costumes were quite beautiful and greta scacchi played the part of well if you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and or jefferson then watch it's much better than jefferson in paris
<START> a fantastic movie and very overlooked gary has never been more handsome and ingrid is more beautiful than in any other film if you don't believe just watch the movie every cast member is wonderful the love scenes between gary and ingrid will make your pulse race the story is great the script is oscar caliber don't miss this film
