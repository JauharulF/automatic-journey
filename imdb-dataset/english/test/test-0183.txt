<START> the 3rd in the series finds paul bronson turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy i don't know why this movie shoved me into it but somehow it did i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those punks every time he blew one of them away i felt good this movie does not take itself seriously but what if it did there is a good build up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage but as far as acting and plot go it just doesn't measure up if i lived in that neighborhood i would get out as fast as i could but it seems like the people are asking for trouble i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets but there is a limit here folks i had to give it a 4 sure there are good blow 'em away scenes but that's about it at that time bronson was 64 i'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson bronson takes the place of a or stallone in this movie this movie gives you a sense of rejoice the common man can save the neighborhood save the day to sum it up this is far from being the original death wish but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up
<START> what that was it the town sheriff john agar blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin did i just write that did i just see that br br with by the wildcats night fright is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967 the heyday of the gorilla was well over and anyone other than ray corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4 0 rating on the imdb but sadly this one never should have stood a chance of seeing the light of day oops there's another quirk you can never tell if it's day or night in the story since they seem interchangeable with one another br br i'll give you this though a couple of the early malt shop scenes looked like they could have gone on the air as coke commercials thinking about it now those were probably the best looking and best lit scenes of the picture coca cola must have paid for them had they seen the completed movie they might have been better served to prevent it's release
<START> it's important to keep in mind the real meaning of the phrase inspired by a true story when watching pride it's sort of like you could save up to 50 which can quite literally be translated to you can't save more than 50 it all sounds great until you realize that the lower part of up to is zero similarly inspired by a true story means that someone heard a story and it made them think of this one the only certainty is that the real story and the one you're about to see are not the same thing br br there is a real jim ellis that began coaching the swim team at the philadelphia department of recreation in the early 1970s but i have a feeling that the real jim ellis must not have been able to conceal some feelings of disappointment at the way the movie turned out clearly it takes wild liberties with the story of his life and i just picture him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so much different than the man they know br br at any rate one thing that he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by terrence howard one of our finest actors who starred alongside bernie mac who despite the lack of an original and powerful story still gives a heartfelt and moving performance br br the movie takes place in 1970s philadelphia a time and place where racism was the norm not the exception and the educated and professional jim ellis who is also an accomplished swimmer is having trouble finding a worthwhile teaching position until finally relegated to a falling apart recreation center which he is assigned the task of cleaning up before its demolition we can certainly understand his feeling of br br when we first meet the maintenance man bernie mac he is a disillusioned who sits in his office surrounded by piles of junk that touch the ceiling and watching daytime tv on an old dusty television set needless to say when jim shows up to start cleaning the place up and clearing it out is not exactly friendly with him he knew his rec center was being closed and all his anger about that transferred quite smoothly onto jim br br given his past as a college swimmer jim takes a special interest in the pool which he cleans and fills and brings to top shape a group of black teenagers who play basketball just outside the rec center take interest in the pool when their basketball rim is taken away and the heat remains stifling and soon the group have a developing swim team on their hands which they enter into a citywide swim meet to call them underdogs of course would be something of an understatement they're unorganized unprofessional insufficiently trained and have no idea how to behave at a swim meet br br that doesn't matter of course the movie is your standard underdog sports story so the first athletic outing is totally unimportant as anything other than a learning experience a catalyst to drive their much harder and much more focused training that will lead up to the final athletic outing the one that matters by now the only thing a sports movie has going for it is that the protagonist s do not have to win at the film's climax we only have to understand the meaning and significance of their effort br br sadly the movie has all of the character development of an old seagal movie the good guys are the good guys because they're just supposed to be and the bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who laugh and and make racist jokes at our team oh and there's one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while in the middle of a race i didn't know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that but you get the idea of how deep the character development is br br we understand that this is the group of kids that jim ellis turned from kids hanging out on the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers but other than that we don't really get to know anything about who they are br br but the biggest problem is that the only real statements that the movie makes are that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad both of these are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary racism was so much more powerful in america in the 1970s that it feels like an enormous loss that the movie dealt directly with that issue but didn't really say anything about it it's sort of a feel good movie but when it's over and you realize how much it should have said is much bigger than what it said the feel good sensation turns into a sad disappointment
<START> this is one of the bleakest the most harrowing of bergman's films i've seen i also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to the human souls br br the couple of musicians who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as farmers find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would have ordinarily been impossible for them even imagine as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war they betray their souls their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day liv and max von sydow are brilliant as usual as lost confused and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war br br 9 5 10
<START> first of all i know almost nothing about rugby so although i found the rugby aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and i think i would have enjoyed it just as much the fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me br br what made this movie great is the story itself based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the highland rugby club coach is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have someone who cares more about the person than the sport even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years the more i have learned about the coach and team the more i like this movie and its message br br i have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first but then i researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10 fact and 90 fiction with the 10 of facts being greatly exaggerated not so with forever strong it may seem too good to be true but that's what's so amazing about it if it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more instead the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person br br don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics i have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews these are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate in fact i would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because i almost always disagree with their opinions br br go see this movie and post your review positive or negative currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive here and on rotten tomatoes and similar sites and i am interested to see if this trend continues thanks
<START> luther the geek 1990 is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by troma's standards it's about a freak who bites the heads off chickens and kills people by biting their necks out and he actually thinks he's a chicken himself luther gets released from prison after 25 yrs because he's been a model prisoner and deserves another chance in life which is very hard to believe after you see how he acts and treats people throughout the movie br br after killing an elderly lady in a supermarket car park he manages to sneak into a womans car and proceeds to torture her her daughter and the daughters boyfriend at their family home in the country br br then we get treated to a long winded and boring movie with awful acting all the way through before a useless cop turns up to try and kill luther once and for all oh and the film has a ridiculous and laughable ending too i love low budget horror movies and i think the toxic avenger is an all time classic but i'm afraid luther the geek is just boring illogical and dull not much in the way of gore too just afew bloody neck and thats about it 3 10
<START> spoiler alert wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this film first of all we think it is hilarious that the producer in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent what the hell was that anyway romanian and how is it that in denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures note the scottish camp director and who does the shopping for the bog creatures their pants looked like they were purchased at banana republic very nicely dressed for being 1200 years old this one was worse than scarecrow slayer we didn't think that was even possible we basically fast forwarded through 75 of the movie looking for any gore death scary moments none found do rent the dvd just to watch the 2 hour behind the scenes of bog creatures featurette who are these people are they serious and the filmmakers are like 60 years old i think this is their holy grail and that's pathetic enough in and of itself br br best line from the movie hands down not bad for a girl who never even went to graduate school my blind grandma who has alzheimers could make a better movie
<START> what really stood out to me about this movie was how little the plot made sense so many characters were randomly introduced it was like how i imagine tommy the room would be re envisioned for the disney channel set we had the wise elderly couple who kept on hanging out where jane worked telling the same story about how soda brought them together or jane's mom stepmom random crying woman who would all show up at random times br br aaron carter's acting is definitely the highlight of this film i actually looked forward to every scene he appeared in the editing is painfully bad with scene cuts that make no sense the jane character is really irritating mooning about and moping about j d mcqueen the scenes with the music awards are more depressing than anything else and the ending of this movie is surreal
<START> perry mason the case of the glass coffin finds raymond burr defending david copperfield rick blaine like magician peter from a murder charge involving one of his assistants a trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of nancy comes a tumbling out br br nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her first in a moment of drunken weakness got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past br br billy moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in home town a little more action than usual for ken he almost gets himself killed br br one big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics the medical report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that could not possibly have done the deed the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer br br when you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual but you'll also see how the investigating officer james got it wrong from the start it kind of spoils this particular mason film
<START> what we have here the standard disney direct to dvd sequel where i would expect cots are cut in all areas resulting in an okay animated movie that falls well short of the original that is not to say that this is a terrible movie it is just that it is a very mediocre movie full of the preachy messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and being nice to one another and unless done subtly which it is not here can quickly become grating for adults the film has a very thin plot line with trying to win the approval of his father and ending up finding the true meaning of wealth and success this has it's comedy moments but is really nor enough to carry a full length film
<START> this film could cure sleep disorders thats how bad it is the story dragged and the bad guy is not that scary you will not even see this one on tbs reruns this film made me wonder about chuck film choices he work on a real dog with this one

<START> i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful br br awfully long even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life br br awfully boring the parts they included were long winded and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained br br awfully inaccurate the side to this film was a joke and last time i checked khan wasn't exactly a nice guy br br awfully acted i found several of the characters hard to believe they were very two dimensional and lacked and kind of depth br br a saving grace of the film was the cinematography that is why i gave this film a 2 star rating rather than the bare minimum however if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead br br all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss
<START> look i've practically lost all hope in nickelodeon after watching their newest hit the naked brothers band show and is no exception if you haven't noticed is now the 1 hit tween sitcom on television right now after hearing this i decided to watch a few episodes myself to see what the hype was about i have one word to describe this show in general effortless i cannot believe that dan schneider would go this low and make something this crappy it's horrible let me give you the details br br the cast starts out with a girl by the name of carly played by miranda cosgrove carly unfortunately throughout the episodes doesn't really have a personality so to speak of i guess she's supposed to be the average girl in the show because a lot of people have an army veteran for a dad an artist for a brother and a popular teen web show taped and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment and to say the most about miranda her acting is pathetic she sounds like a 3 year old girl with tourette's syndrome on a sugar high half the time br br next we have sam puckett good god where do they get these names played by mccurdy sam is the co host of web show wait a minute if sam hosts the show with carly shouldn't the show be called and sam i bet sam feels like she's been ripped off sam is supposed to be the bully in the cast yeah because every girl bully wears girly skin tight shirts and pants with blonde hair she also i think is supposed to be a tomboy too i would find this a little funny but it's her clichÃ© puns that ruin it the give me a bucket of fried chicken pun is overused way too much give this girl a script and give her a coffee because don't get me wrong acting is okay but throughout half the episodes she looks like she's about ready to fall asleep br br next we have freddie benson played by nathan freddie is the technical producer for carly and sam's show there's not much to say about freddie other than the fact that he's a techno geek and has a crush on carly which never works out here we go again with the clichÃ©s does it not stop nathan's acting is also okay but seems to get excessive sometimes he's too boring br br lastly and my most favorite we have spencer played by jerry trainor let me make this perfectly clear if it weren't for him this dirt cluster of a show would be mud spencer is the one who keeps the show alive spencer is the older brother of carly if you had a little 5 year old who was both on a caffeine high and constipated you would have this character summed up spencer also earns money from being an artist hmmm i wonder you would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures yeah i just love sarcasm his art is pretty much utter crap i mean what kind of sculpture name is merry what that's about as much creativity as a hillary clinton speech on drugs it's stupid br br the plot settings and morals are effortless bags of poop these shows are now telling kids that stealing lying and being an asshole to your parents is a good thing if these are the kinds of awful crappy shows that they're throwing at kids these days then i don't want to take part in watching any of them this is biggest piece of crap i've ever watched on tv bar none nickelodeon i'm through with you end of story 1 10
<START> there are no no redeeming qualities to this film they didn't check a single fact not one about anything i feel sorry for larry miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue br br the adults are all idiotic the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality the music is honestly cheesy the plot is beyond belief br br i you want to see something good with your family see anything else take some time and check for in your attic my ten year old is mocking this film as we watch it he's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching
