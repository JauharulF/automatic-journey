<START> i saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie i do not understand why it is called a monster movie the movie is a drama i was expecting a lot of destruction but what did i get most of the movie was relationship problems and people thinking that a woman was a loony because she saw a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason the action started a few minutes toward the end since the woman was killed isn't that murder couldn't they have done anything else besides murder her if you watch this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie don't watch it it is not a monster movie it is a drama
<START> excellent introspective interpersonal piece that really had some teeth to it without feeling hopeless or worse manipulative artificially gratifying might be a good double feature with american beauty as well best performance to date that i've seen from anita and every actor in this seems like a powerhouse hats off to ann hui for the direction and ivy ho for the brilliant script seriously one of the best dramas i've seen in a while especially if you have a taste for classical literature ala poetry again excellent
<START> i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them these days though people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness it has a slow beginning but then look out if you love romantic comedies but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change or at least did have back in the 70's then you should see this movie
<START> but even caricatures need a plausible plot line i suppose in 1934 some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce it doesn't age well it does give nat pendelton and zasu pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles pendelton who is featured prominently in the thin man series tries his best but is over matched by witless plot with the backdrop being a stage play with gangsters its not exactly original material movie's saving grace is the always excellent edward everett horton in a wasted performance but don't waste your time watching everett in this film i would encourage anyone to watch him in his effort in holiday with cary grant and katherine hepburn same era 1936 but much better script and storyline better gags and needless to say star power as well
<START> i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because i'm not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true i found mission better than it's predecessor for different reasons but the major one is this it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an amalgam like the first movie the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy who's name is escaping me but he's the other architect i don't know how this movie played in english my first language is french so i didn't have that problem i imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate i've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that's important too i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves et
<START> the most remarkable thing about talk radio is how bad it is the voices all have a phony reading from a script ring to them an evening with an annoying loudmouth at a dallas radio station is told with the of a glimpse into hell stone tries for an existential revelation and gets unintended comedy instead whenever a caller makes a profound empty point about something stone shoves the camera at one of his character's face as they are stricken with some traumatic realization that is never revealed to the audience bogosian overacts throughout in one of the most irritating performances ever smeared onto celluloid underrated classic give me a break
<START> this was another great episode from season 11 of south park br br cartman fakes having syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble he is able to swear at the other kids at school kyle tells the principal that cartman is faking it but she doesn't believe it chris hansen is planning on having cartman to be on dateline to talk about syndrome live and uncensored but later on cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff this was a funny episode about cartman faking syndrome i recommend it to any south park fan
<START> valley girl is an exceptionally well made film with an all around great cast even though the dialogue is a bit dated now when the movie was released it was very hip to this day i know many people teenagers included that cannot form a sentence without using the word like that is without a doubt the legacy this movie will leave a rating of 8 was given for this like most excellent movie
<START> i would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film it really does grip you john paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings br br i imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position especially with children leaving home older but i wouldn't say wiser with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery br br i think this film should definitely have a wider audience i would also say that the other actors played brilliant parts as well it is such a deep film and very moving
<START> when the noble clan is decimated by the usurping clan loyal retainer jun escapes with his lord's eight year old son and his daughter they are sheltered by the priestess who serves the god majin a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain ten years later and seek vengeance against lord but are captured in the attempt and sentenced to die priestess desperately attempting to save her master threatens with the god's displeasure only to be slashed to death for her efforts a vain cruel narrow man orders statue to be destroyed in order to crush any last vestiges of hope among the remaining loyalists but the god majin who hitherto has been silent has other ideas br br daimajin is an enthralling timeless deeply moving fairy tale lavishly produced on a respectable budget it is a film about values the values of nobility of justice of decency of loyalty of self sacrifice and of love it is about hierarchy and rule and of the consequences of failing to live up to the responsibility that rule entails these are things that are not talked about much in our times except by scribbling toads like william bennet but are nonetheless relevant and daimajin shows us why br br daimajin is a perfect example of why japanese cinema is so glorious the values listed above have palpable relevance for those involved in this film as they do for many a japanese filmmaker there is no lip service no condescension no irony here instead there is an authentic effort to conjure a world where these values can once again have life and to show what happens when they fall into abeyance just compare daimajin or the lone wolf and cub series or any kurosawa film to the egregious tarantino's nihilistic kill bill b to see what i mean br br in a film whose contributing talent is so uniformly excellent i would merely like to point out master akira majestic score the talent and beauty of actors jun and and the stunning portrayal by her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful that i have ever witnessed
<START> committed is all about graham as an irrepressible optimist who goes in search of her self estranged husband who has gone in search of himself which all leads to a sort of upbeat comedic odyssey involving a bunch of side characters and issues a fresh fun and unpredictable little flick what committed lacks in story it makes up for in good and subtle morals and if you enjoy this little chick flick which received slightly above average reviews by critics and public alike you might want to check out lisa krueger's hit indie manny lo 1996 b
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong nicolas cage fan back in the mid 80's i taped this movie when vcr's were impossible to do this with and would watch it over and over nicolas cage is just brilliant here and he looks wonderful and has no affecting acting isms see peggy sue got married to know what i mean about that i measure all his performances against this one he was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends the music was great the the furs modern english men at work whenever i hear melt with you i am taken back to the finale of this movie br br what ever happened to his cute costar deborah foreman and his hysterical friend cameron dye certainly took a different turn than nicolas interestingly the slutty friend elizabeth daily ended up being the voice of tommy from the rugrats she is billed as e g daily for that horrid show bizarre br br if you want to take a great trip back to the 80's watch this movie it is definitely a classic like totally
<START> i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970's 1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn't reprise her role in the film she wasn't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind
<START> first off i'm not a firefighter but i'm in some kind of para firefighting unit the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for so i had some training and simulation but i have no real life experience br br but still there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable i can understand that they removed the mouth nose pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke because the public would otherwise see nothing but some things defy logic br br no second mask attached to the oxygen how the hell do you want to rescue people trough the smoke without one br br rappelling people no it's not done like that i'd be screaming too if somebody hitched a rope around me in that fashion and hung me from a building if i could scream that is and not pass out from want of air because the rope squeezes my lungs the second time when they're jack it's better but still weird br br aim high no you bloody don't you always fight fire from as low as possible you don't fight want to sprinkle flames you'll want to the fire and that's below the flames br br no discipline they're running around like chicken and they shout all the time instead of using radio and keeping discipline br br no tactics why don't they work in teams of at least two you still can get separated but it takes much more than if everyone just scurries around alone in search for victims br br do they really enter buildings without bringing water i europe firefighters would never enter a burning building without br br firefighters on the roof wtf do they think they're doing there without security lines or water exploding rooms wood and brick does not explode suddenly br br the better points are actually camaraderie and the other non firefighting parts of the movie it's a lot of kitsch but that's alright i'll give it a point for this
<START> this movie was a waste of time it looks nice pretty settings nicely acted appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff it doesn't happen br br it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie it was clearly very professionally done and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b movie br br save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs funny jean de or manon of the spring i can't recall the language in europa europa but that's another great film heavy but very worth viewing br br this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing
