<START> dominion is a good movie but not original it blends some elements of slasher movie and adventure flick the setting is wonderful the acting is acceptable and the film is fast paced and exciting highly recommended for any thriller adventure buff
<START> it is depressing that many people don't understand this movie to get caught up in the peripheral elements is to miss the true meaning of this film this film speaks to the minority of people who actually believe in love and truth it points out that in todays society too often people say what sounds good at the moment with no intention of backing things up when things get rough as someone else stated that is evident in the number of divorces some people actually believe marriage is forever forget about stereotypes or anything else but rather focus on what is important following your heart and fighting for who you believe in i liked the ending because it would have been easy to go with a sappy one but came instead with the reality that is great and you should fight with everything you have but sometimes that still isn't enough too often people just give up and forget about the magic of love late

<START> i have to admit that i liked this film much more than i expected to will smith has that clean cut charm that you just can't help but like the plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff somewhat reminiscent of jane austen's emma this guy kevin james has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy i have never seen his tv show but he was cast very well in this film amber was good enough i can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film but if she was supposed to be an actress or model then the casting might have left something to be desired i enjoyed julie ann emery and wish she'd had a larger part but saving the best for last eva mendes more or less stole the show her beauty and charm and just the right amount of had me glued to the screen whenever she was there i hope to see more of her in the future this film is definitely worth checking out
<START> in los angeles the alcoholic and lazy hank matt dillon performs a wide range of non qualified functions just to get enough money to drink and gamble in horse races his primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women br br factotum is an uninteresting pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior in accordance with imdb this character would be the fictional alter ego of the author charles bukowski and based on this story i will certainly never read any of his novels honestly if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples better off watching the touching and heartbreaking hector or marco di that is based on the life of the same writer my vote is four br br title brazil factotum Â destino factotum Â without destiny
<START> rating 7 out of 10 directed by barbet schroeder if you like hitchcock's then you will like this movie murder by stars sandra bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie mayweather her partner is sam kennedy a non discriminatory detective played by ben chaplin br br the teenage killers are high school students richard haywood ryan gosling and justin pendleton michael pitt these young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers br br the supporting characters include a police chief an assistant district attorney and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on the movie reminds me of various movies crossed with the tv show law and order' we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't br br the other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweather's past and incarcerated ex husband most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story br br murder by is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe or should i say dangerous murder mystery for more thrills and suspense try or hitchcock's dial m for murder'
<START> if you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this ain't it if you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you there are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy let's start with the opening titles that say jack o and then add the word lantern as if the viewer wasn't able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie after that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense jack o is everywhere he's in people's houses in the woods and yet he doesn't ever seem to do much of anything he does make a few kills but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish jack o would take out his rage on you the viewer other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line the acting in this film is among the worst i've ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie watching the boy who is the lead in the film the director's son has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actors actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons especially the bug eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers but having said all this if you take this for what it is that is a steaming pile of dung then you will get a few laughs from this movie what i also found amusing is that the makers of the dvd saw fit to release a 10th anniversary version of this movie as if the original wasn't good enough and someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition i'm not sure why i'll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10
<START> i just watched the movie tonight and i found it brilliant it doesn't have special effects that blow your mind and it's not violent or bloody no terrorist or aliens but it's brilliant it's just plain nice sweet and it brought me to a whole different time a much simpler time where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out at the ocean i think it was beautiful and i for one recommend it nick was a great character and his friendship with harry was one of the highlights of the movie everyone is entitled to their opinion but i believe everyone should watch this mostly when they feel down or when they want to share something nice with their friends
<START> as much as i like walter matthau i felt that the majority of his roles were tailored towards his personality this role is one of the exceptions he plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest this role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles i liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid commitment in a relationship his whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman but not to be committed in any way the alibi using his secretary ingrid bergman to pretend to be his wife at some point in the movie the pretend mr and mrs actually are deluded into believing that they were actually really married the ending was good because a middle aged man found that pursuing someone in his own age group was more worthwhile the movie was funny entertaining and didn't sell out by being preachy
<START> just got into viewing program for the first time recently the 2 hour kidnapping program don't know why i didn't sooner james caan is outstanding and wholly believable in the role as the chief honcho at the featured 5 vegas complex br br so often programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or director br br that is certainly not the case with this program along with caan all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive and believable the guest actors are well chosen br br the stories i've seen are interesting and the show presents a good view of the city as well br br this is an entertaining program and one i hope will remain i don't know how i managed to miss it for so long but plan to tivo it from now on
<START> even if it's not labeled as a slasher flick it has all the elements the fact that slashers are well known for it's low budget lame plot cheesy effects and everything you may add it doesn't means that there can't be good slasher movies opera fills the description even though it's part of italian giallo which is far from being a slasher sub genre br br dario argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror opera is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years though the movie takes place in a beautiful shinning place the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie br br i think of opera as a stylish slasher although there's in depth plot and character development the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful visually stunning gore tale the movie's plot is simple as in every slasher there's a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress singer and forces her to watch gruesome deaths the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie the infamous peep hole death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion it's a terrific death scene that none other than argento could release the knife through the neck and mouth is another gruesome scene but less violent than the scissors death the gore in opera will please the wicked and lovers of violence br br what i didn't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic i mean after watching the first death the lead female calmed as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesn't makes much of a big deal about what she saw also she's left alone in home and doesn't take security measures still the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious for example when betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens br br the direction of the movie is great for an italian giallo it's excellent argento's creative pov shots are impressive the ravens also added a creepy feeling to the movie argento add his unique spice br br opera is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons in my opinion the peep hole death scene brilliant the ravens attack in the end the opera setting the knife through the neck and mouth the heavy metal score combined with opera music this music never freaked me out before the killer's ferocity br br the only thing i don't like about opera is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes it's ok to disturb the audience but i think that the opera music could've added a creepier feeling still the shocking use of heavy metal is a singular disturbing aspect in the movie br br watch opera even if you don't like gore there's a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person this is no suspiria but it deserves to be among argento's finest
<START> looking for a movie for your turkey film festival the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of all time the plot the story of a post apocalyptic roller samurai warrior is a convoluted hodge podge of film references of everything from star wars to the seven the acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal the scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter frank black knight reminds one too much of john cleese's black knight in monty python and the holy grail word of advice frank when you stoop to doing a movie like this one your career is over i chanced upon this little stink bomb on a low end cable channel and i could not stop watching it is like watching a train wreck you just can't look away
<START> when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic the character developments also lacked in depth i think that this was very much a product of the 80s the film does not hold up today
<START> well where to start i stumbled across this one in 1993 and just hit record on the vcr out of habit more than anything else citizen kane it sure isn't but if you've had a bad day and are in the mood for crashing out in front of something not too intellectually stimulating then i tentatively suggest this might just be your thing br br we have the lot here great title track more stereotypes than you could shake a stick at unconscious comedy the fight scene of all time and more more more david hemmings plays the opposite of his role in the 60s classic blow up still a photographer still hormonally stimulated but not quite the same br br john philip law is easy to slam as an actor who makes a log appear but that wouldn t be fair seeing as how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role br br wexler as amanda suffice to say it was her one and only film role the real star of this movie though is ethel evans who plays a shall we say secretary with the morals of an alley cat and an ambition to match the way she manages to reconcile her present life with that of a future with her comedian husband to be is actually quite touching in an earthy gritty what is to be will be way br br i actually love this movie when i'm in the mood for it and wouldn't touch it with the proverbial when i'm not br br kudos to the cast for keeping a relatively straight face when filming br br a classic in the edward d wood school of cinematic endeavours
<START> by convincing the prime minister to back the totally unsuitable ali g as a candidate for in the local elections nasty chancellor david carlton charles dance hopes to discredit his party's current leader thus enabling him to seize power to his surprise however the plan backfires ali is embraced by the nation and carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future br br puerile crude misogynistic and always outrageous ali g the big screen debut outing for sascha baron cohen's middle class gangsta is all of these things and much it's my kind of film br br obviously there are those who are simply not going to get the joke and there will definitely be people who find risquÃ© jokes about oral sex homosexuality recreational drug use hardcore pornography and the queen's nether regions offensive in the extreme needless to say they should stay well away but if you find such juvenile humour side splittingly hilarious are a fan of baron cohen in general or just want to see hottie in her underwear and you shud cuz she well fit then i fully recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of ali g and the west massive br br they wicked
