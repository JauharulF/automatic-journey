<START> i recently bought this movie on dvd at a discount store for 5 although it is a no frills dvd on the label just the movie that starts playing immediately no menu no special features the picture and sound quality were excellent the movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history br br richard jordan who i must admit to not having heard of plays the lead pinky green a charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so he portrays an american in england david niven plays the lead bad guy also with the great charm for which he is famous bad but with scruples as when he refuses to deny pinky his whack for the job whack in england apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in american gangster films all the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable movie br br what is perhaps best to me is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable i frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters without any special effects no blood no violence not even a single car chase just a well written story well acted well directed and well photographed if i had any complaints about the movie i would question the music what is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in england
<START> brilliant ranks along with citizen kane the matrix and godfathers must see at least for basset in her early days watch it
<START> i think that this is a fabulous movie i watched it constantly from the time i was 4 to about the time i was 8 however watching it resulted in many nightmares i particularly got them because of the guy that was always like the and his friends i am 12 and i still get nightmares about it to this day i can't fall asleep right now because i am thinking about it i love this movie but it is so scary i definitely love this movie though i have very good memories from it kate is very good at acting in this movie amazingly i never realized that it was her i also think that the graphics were very high quality contrary to what some other people think
<START> if movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all either male tough guys or female eye candy sounds good to you then perhaps this movie may not be a total waste of film needless to say the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute bore with little acting talent and even less of a script yes athena massey is nice to look at but that is the only positive thing that i can say about this disaster
<START> some of the reviewers here have foolishly judged this silent film by political correctness standards of today br br battle was an excellent film for several reasons correctly noted by more rational reviewers superb cast lots of action innovative editing and photography br br its stars were in effect the d w griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan that is enough to watch it and to enjoy it br br i saw it many years ago and just watched it again at youtube that was a very poor quality print but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater i can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians
<START> this is seriously one of the best low budget b movies that i have ever seen i am not one to stand up and cheer during a movie but this one was definitely worth it obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people well eats is a subjective term i guess it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and dissolves them in it's goodness the best part of this movie is that william russ is one of the main characters the typical family man actually started his career with this movie and an afro there is plenty of nudity in this flick so obviously not for the children but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie it is my belief that everyone needs a little death bed in their lives at some point or other it's best to get it sooner than later
<START> this slightly ponderous late 50's sci fi horror schlock isn't entirely a loser it's about a manned space rocket that crash lands in a remote area a bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma he's being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him anyway the title alien monster soon raises it's head causing general havoc including partial head removal br br the main problem with the film is it's pacing it takes quite a while for the blood beast to appear and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so he is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but that's really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief at the end of the movie where we have the final stand off and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier you will be doing well not to have a giggle so too in the brilliant x ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating about in the astronaut's body it's just too funny for words br br but unfortunately the fun moments in night of the blood beast come too few and far between if you're a 50's sci fi nut though then it's well worth checking this one out just don't expect too much
<START> after waiting years for a definitive collection of led zeppelin perfomances on video fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the greatest concert video ever much better than the dismal song remains the same this video includes performances from no less than 5 different venues spanning a decade it also includes rare interviews and tv appearances the sound quality is amazing considering the source material used and the video quality is even more impressive this is an absolute must for any led zeppelin fan
<START> the bbc's blue planet is simply jaw dropping i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film from familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths next to nothing is left out weighing in at a hefty 8 hours some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film deep blue but i would heartily recommend you give the series a go i don't think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by pixar's finding nemo i'm sure they will love this too i just wish all television was this entertaining
<START> john huston actor and director better known for more robust fare such as the misfits and african queen directs his daughter angelica huston in what would be his last film indeed the film was released after huston's death based on james joyce's novella of the same name the dead tells the quiet story of a new year's celebration in 1904 dublin huston his cast and his screenwriters including his son tony have created a gem of a movie the novella is among joyce's finest works as well as being the only one that is filmable the film is a tribute to huston's genius he has taken a small beautiful story and has made a small beautiful movie donal mccann and angelica huston shine although shine is too showy too flashy a word to describe their quiet understated performances the dead reflects the huston family's love for ireland and is in its own quiet way a fitting final movie for a legend
<START> it's 2 stars only because they put a lot of work in making this game look good i played plenty of good and bad games and i think this game has the dullest story i was ever forced to listen the best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations but no you must listen to them talking for 10 minutes and just continue doing the same things over and over again climb the building save the citizen go kill some dude it's all the same should really hire someone with some imagination br br i'm a huge fan of prince of persia series first 3 the story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time i don't even hate prince of persia 4 but i think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for assassin's creed should be banned to write another thing for the rest of his life br br boring story and same missions over and over again if just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing
<START> mad scientist professor drinks a potion he has up in his laboratory but is turned into a blood craving vampire instead when dr pays a visit sees a picture of wife shabnam and after turning into a vampire heads for shabnam to make her his bride brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother at castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul succeeds in putting the bite on shabnam and once turned she tries to lure her young niece away brother races against time to put a stop to the vampire curse almost put me to sleep the plot is extremely slow but more or less follows bram stoker's famous novel the suspense is completely absent as is the gore and nudity the film is only recommended for curious horror fans that want to see the second horror film made in pakistan after madman from 1964
<START> the always delightful kevin spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives after driving us into believing he is a mumbling small time crook only to expose the true power of cinematic deception in the classic the usual suspect this time around he leads us into believing he is a likable alien who assumes a human form whilst strolling around the earth br br is a peculiar stranger who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere only to be hospitalized in the manhattan psychiatric institution dr mark powell jeff bridges soon takes extreme interest in him and even finds himself pondering if is actually a supreme being from planet k pax or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues while the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways it remains a complex enlightening journey which leaves a gr eat deal of intriguing philosophical questions behind it
<START> this show can most accurately be described as tv bubble gum it's chewing it has a good taste to it and it lasts a long time but like bubble gum it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews br br this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games like hangman guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list callers are the contestants and anybody can play br br the questions though are terribly easy there's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop it never seems to get old but it never adds much to the show anyway the hostess however regardless of which one that it is extremely personable pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions i rather enjoy that british woman br br but there's nothing to this show it's simplistic and uncompelling although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on
<START> the ghost walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist snappy dialog and best of all a pansy played to the hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character mr arthur is great in his role of homer bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood played by another great character actor richard carle br br they play off of each other superbly br br although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer who fires and him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee br br there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him br br the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches br br for a low budget poverty row picture this film has superb set decoration and great costuming br br director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through br br this film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films old dark house mysteries they actually managed to work in the lines it was a dark and stormy night and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end br br this movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the internet archive at archive org
