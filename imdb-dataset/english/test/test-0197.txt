<START> laughably awful one might think that all the big name actors involved in this movie would at least make it believable but they do not this one is a stinker br br characters either sprint around without having a good reason to know where they are going or they stand around making constipated faces when they should be running for their lives br br check your higher brain functions at the door if you intend to try watching this movie or get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this one the mystery science theater 3000 treatment that's what i was doing through the second half of this turkey br br and please don't confuse this with the excellent movie the day of the a far superior thriller from 30 years ago
<START> victor plunges the viewer into life's lower depths for much of its running time with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation family violence and suicidal despair but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of death itself here death is embodied as a ghostly horse drawn carriage driven by a wretched sinner who was the last person to die on the previous new year's eve for one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on december 31st becomes the new driver br br the scenes involving this carriage the film was known as the phantom carriage or the phantom chariot in english speaking countries are eerie and mesmerizing utilizing double exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today most strikingly the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned as fascinating as these scenes are however the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of david holm played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life in flashbacks we see holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife children and brother and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy abruptly without segue or explanation we then see holm as an alcoholic wreck in trouble with the law and alienated from his family ordinarily this leap from before to after might feel like a story telling deficiency but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar sordid details on our own it's suggested that holm has been led astray by his friend georges the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the phantom carriage but whatever the cause of his downfall holm appears to be a lost cause a mean spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform br br while david holm is our central figure the story's true catalyst is a young salvation army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior when the nurse herself is dying indirectly due to her ministrations on holm's behalf she demands to see him and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery br br at times this film resembles dickens' tale of scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life suffer over his and reform i was also reminded of 1917 drama terje in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone a sequence echoed here the director also reiterates a standard theme of scandinavian folklore found earlier in his berg hans a k a the outlaw and his wife 1918 that no man can outrun his fate this time however it could be argued that david holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate for he's given an unexpected second chance to make amends br br viewers expecting a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the phantom carriage of the title but may not be prepared for this film's painful examination of a troubled man's alcoholic downfall but those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate in its entirety it stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of most accomplished works
<START> this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going but never really did it was simply boring to watch so much in fact i could just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the cover of the videotape made it out to be one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting of course it does not help this movie at all mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the 1970's called the deep bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio zombie movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie that day we learned a valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
<START> wow not because of the 3 d imagery which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery but what a lame ending the end of the movie just seems to implode on itself this film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it the misogyny of this film is painful as well if you are looking for a bad 50s sci fi film to laugh at aka 'bot fodder go for it otherwise look for better films
<START> this delightful well written film is based on a new york stage play bearing the same title where sir aubrey knighted sir charles aubrey smith in 1944 originated the role he plays in the film here in 1931 we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of talkies and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in little women which released in 1949 br br this engaging play is about an elderly british aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them having brought them to his manor in england br br marion davies plays his daughter by error and it's a tour de force for her she is all at once endearing impatient shallow enchanting wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory br br the 26 year old ray milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years br br the film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless however it's a charming pleasure from first scene to the last
<START> this movie was total cheese it stank the only thing good about it was the acting other then that nothing noteworthy at all br br big time spoilers coming up don't read anymore if you have not seen it br br this movie is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been shattered as a result of their younger son and later as they find out older son have been molested by their daycare providers although they are called liars in court and the defense attorney is a real prick the jury finds them guilty and convicts them br br in the end all i can say to the director is the next time you wanna make a movie like this do it differently
<START> exclusively for coop's lovers though clint eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film it is a biography of gary cooper based mainly on his filmography but also on more private archives which show him as a child as a young man as a family man with some of his friends picasso hemingway etc as an older man finally as a sick and close to death man after the end i did not have the feeling that i knew the man any much better but i have spent a very good moment re viewing many of the best moments of his movies and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was increased tenfold the film shows most interestingly how the career of cooper can be paralleled with the evolution of usa society before and after ww2 two of the great moments are the time when cooper has to answer justice about communism in the movie world and when james stewart a very great one too received an award for cooper one month before his death i'm not a weeping pot but that was a close one watch it if you can it is so much worth while if you love cooper that is or an older america
<START> the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history almost as good as the shower scene in psycho and the acting by robert walker is fantastic a psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders thatÂ´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem why guy haines go to the cop in the first place 4 5 br br
<START> after two terrorist attacks in europe one in london and the other in amsterdam the prime suspect is the leader al alon the cia agent roger ferris leonardo dicaprio that operates in the middle east is assigned by his superior at langley ed hoffman russell crowe to keep a safe house in amman under surveillance and he associates to the chief of security in jordan salaam mark strong roger does not disclose the whole operation to and it fails due to the intervention of ed meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse and he gets close to her family when roger plots another scheme to catch al using the innocent architect omar ali as decoy to lure al he jeopardizes not only the safety of but also that is kidnapped after the execution of roger tries to negotiate the release of with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse br br body of lies is a disappointing tour through europe and middle east despite the names of ridley scott leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe the imdb user rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking but that is not my case it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation the rich character performed by leonardo dicaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in middle east due to his but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east the rescue of roger ferris alive is also very stupid and corny my vote is four br br title brazil de network of lies
<START> best years of our lives perfectly captures the era of my youth and the feelings of that time the cast was uniformly wonderful this was possibly dana andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an academy award there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all the cinematography is among the best of any film this movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's a must see movie for any true movie fan some critics have said this movie has aged i disagree the theme of human desires is timeless and the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us this is just a great movie one that can be watched over and over again
<START> what really amazed me about this film was that it ringed so false first of all who in the late 80's when the film takes place lived like this family a college professor wouldn't make enough money to support the lifestyle i saw on the film hence he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes especially when she gets cancer second streep is my age and most women particularly in her class educated white well off experienced the feminist movement yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior i actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need br br the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing i have admired carl franklin's films in the past and i actually like meryl streep but gad what a manipulative and lying film this is
<START> with a cheap pound shop having just opened i thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap dvds that looked good and while the back of the cover made this sound like a jeepers creepers type of film it is actually an anthology film and thought one or two of the stories feel very familiar its still a fun light horror comedy the plots br br story one the classic br br a young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a 1500 car but when the guy goes to pick a car a car starts to talk to him the car called says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in life that he must buy for 5000 so while the guys relationship crumbles does everything he can to show who really is in charge br br story two kitchen culture br br a guy that might get thrown out by his land lord due to how messy his flat is discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six months the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself and while they start off as friends they end up having a big falling out the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive br br story three too good to be true br br a girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her but she is unsure that the guy is too perfect and when she thinks that she sees him 'shut down' she starts to get spooked view on the film br br the first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england where it has been given an eighteen rating even thought it has no nudity swearing or blood at all and the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings where the goodies win and while the first story is too close to the stephen king classic christine the second story is easily the highlight of the film with director tom parkinson making the of the story feel like a low budget muppets episode br br final view on the film br br while it does have a bit of a feel their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'
<START> i'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap br br who knows witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff wink wink nudge nudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef i dunno some woman br br but on film it just falls apart faster than a papier mache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman i'd guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways br br okay right there you have a cross section of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic worshippers run amok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over br br no not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much they're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their all br br from the looks of it hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays br br and the torture scenes ecchhhh you'll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie i'd seen br br don't bother it's not worth your time i can't believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didn't see that coming down main street followed by a marching band br br no stars witchery these witches will give you itches
<START> i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival br br based on the novel by jonathan safran foer everything is illuminated is the directorial debut of actor liev schreiber schreiber also wrote the screenplay in the movie jonathan elijah wood obsessively collects items from his family from toothbrushes to to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history but the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare all jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the nazis during the second world war jonathan decides to undertake a quest to ukraine to find the woman thank her and learn more about his grandfather br br his quest is aided there by a couple of characters who run a tourist company for jewish people including a young man obsessed with western culture eugene his grandfather boris who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons of his own from the war and his grandfather's temperamental seeing eye dog br br the screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for jonathan's grandfather's town driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past the best performance probably comes from eugene playing alex jr who starts the movie as a wearing break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only jonathan but all the characters gain their own illumination br br liev schreiber elijah wood and eugene attended the screening and did a very humorous q a after the film br br schreiber was very close to his grandfather who was a ukranian immigrant and who died in 1993 this caused him to start to write to get his memories down on paper meanwhile he was asked to do a reading of short story the very rigid search which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing saying that foer had done in 15 pages what schreiber tried to do in 107 schreiber approached foer and they talked about their grandfathers culture movies and the nature of short term memory in america in the end foer agreed to let schreiber adapt the book br br own project was intended to be a road movie but the book has parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological history of the town of that spans 500 years given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker he said he'd leave that to milos forman and take the road trip instead this imagined chronology was what moved him to make the movie in the first place the idea that a past lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past accurately recalled br br schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents after searching unsuccessfully in ukraine for an actor he was walking through the lower east side in new york when he saw a poster of a woman centaur topless from the waist up with an insane sitting astride her under the poster said the name gogol bordello ukranian punk gypsy band br br eugene then took over the story he had never pursued acting as music was his first passion one day a friend gave him the book and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music screw sentences syntax language is my own br br later they got a call from a production company looking for eastern european music that was medieval but modern met with schreiber and he soon found the movie was based on the book he just happened to be reading not long after that came up schreiber asked what he thought about alex and whether he could do the character by any chance br br foer and schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001 shortly after the events of september 11 both were in europe at the time and they talked about the derogatory comments they were hearing about americans which led schreiber to want to try to find an articulate american who would defy the stereotype that europeans have of americans someone who was awkward vulnerable flawed innocent and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country schreiber started thinking about who that was and elijah came up br br one of inspirations as a filmmaker is emir kusturica i think that's who he said who also directed a segment in another festival movie all the invisible children who said you don't look for the actors you look for the people schreiber said there is something about who elijah is that he has a generosity of spirit and a sincere goodness as a human being that came across on film schreiber said that the eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer and that if eyes are the doors to the soul are garage doors br br elijah wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character kevin in sin city and jonathan in this movie as both are sort of a blank slate on which emotions are projected wood replied that jonathan may seem still and seemingly emotionless but it is all about his observations about his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in br br on the differences between directing and writing schreiber said he likes writing a lot more and jokingly described directing as hell after his grandfather died schreiber started to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself is he content driven or not or just good at interpreting other people's work he said he loved the exercise of figuring out what is emotional to you important to you
<START> what a sucky movie this is without a doubt a low class b movie the german elite stormtroopers assault russian en masse like an old ww1 battle the acting is mediocre the plot thin and it's hard sometimes to follow where it's going the action sequences are pretty worthless when it shows any except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment vehicles from ww2 this is in no way on the same level as saving pvt ryan or platoon lots of worthless attempts at character development which lead nowhere old theme good officer bad officer that's highly predictable even the action sequences look like a old kid set them up i could have directed better too bad this is the same guy that did das boot the boat because that was a dang good movie he must have partied too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film i bought it on dvd better to rent it instead
