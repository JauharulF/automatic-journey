<START> nobody 1999 is a fantastic piece of japanese noir it's about three who get in way over their heads when their innocent drunken p off three other guys one night in a bar when these three mysterious strangers who are up to much more deviant no goodness than even the film allows us to know beat the living daylights out of one of our heroes the trio decides to return the favour in kind only they accidentally kill one of the other guys the remaining two baddies then begin the systematic destruction of everything these poor schmoes hold dear including their fast dwindling sanity video's dvd sleeve features a critic quote calling the film a paranoid street crime freakout or some such and the term more than applies here brooding tense very violent and low key but still pretty slick shot largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing right along with the besieged protagonists who to some degree deserve everything they get i give it a 10
<START> we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br just terrible
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br what is the purpose of this movie a bunch of americans enters nazi occupied france and starts slaughtering germans you see them their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats while making jokes of course br br some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre for a parody it is neither witty nor funny the contents is zero it is exceptionally brutal and disgusting underneath lies a subtle political message because it is again the good guys killing bad nazis the whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around could you imagine a storyline where nazis while making jokes kill everybody in the warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers probably not but this movie is exactly about that with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people br br this movie only works because of the hidden nazi ideology underneath it does not regard the enemy as people and if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun i am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me br br another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the american crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out but if a naked body is pornography this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst br br inglorious basterds is a pointless boring and tasteless waste of time and money
<START> if this film becomes a holiday tradition i am going to have to hide for christmas for the rest of my life how do you even think of comparing this with 'a wonderful life' it was absolutely awful the boy singing made my toes curl and what on earth was the deal with his hair emmy worthy performance please granted lucci did ok but an emmy i think this film is a waste of money the fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse it lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts lighting wardrobe make up it seemed everybody wanted to go home just a big no from me
<START> this film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably the misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission br br hilarity ensues br br like the police academy films the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat i thought it was an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv no it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind but it is fun enough entertainment for 90 some odd minutes plus lauren holly looks hot in a naval uniform
<START> the first film was quite hip and had amusing moments this film doesn't exactly have the same standard calvin palmer ice cube is still trying to keep his barbershop going but this isn't just against stylist gina queen latifah with a beauty shop next door but soon enough a big barbershop chain called nappy opening across the street calvin along with co workers and friends eddie cedric the entertainer jimmy sean patrick thomas terri eve and isaac rosenberg troy they are doing everything they can to keep regular customers coming and ultimately their business running against the competition also starring michael as ricky nash leonard earl howze as harry as quentin leroux robert wisdom as brown lewis as jennifer kenan thompson as and bad company's as loretta i didn't like this film as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about eddie and it isn't as witty i just got bored of it okay
<START> the are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934 i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama it certainly isn't br br it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers br br this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy which lets it down a lot it is quite silly in parts depsite this there are some good action and location scenes br br the cast is lead by jack with anna lee as the love interest br br one viewing is enough for this movie overall a disappointment br br rating 2 stars out of 5
<START> this review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience br br ever rented a scary movie expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot this movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer it was cut poorly and jumped around too much making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction the writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch br br almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare the acting didn't make it scary and the situations hardly made it scary therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile even those were predictable br br not even the gore could've saved the plot and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller se7en br br speaking of se7en i feel like saw tried to follow se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme but failed miserably in doing so i was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer the beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller believe me it is far from that br br oh did i mention poor acting at first cary elwes seems makes a convincing performance however this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot i was left in tears of laughter at this performance which is worthy of a razzie the performance of leigh is also terrible and too played out although not as bad as the performance by elwes and the big red flag with this is that is also a writer for the movie br br the end of saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it and that is what makes it a huge failure it was an opportunity wasted and i have no clue as to why monica potter and danny glover chose to take roles in this movie br br i am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it it was definitely not worth the 4 and in the future i will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with elwes or james wan the big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury i'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this don't watch this movie
<START> jon stewart aka john constantly rips conservatism and anything republican this liberal comic is anything but as he pours his cutting humor down the throats of impressionable youths i've viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy borders on treason he'll take al side over bush any day he's shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a phony laughtrack i do remember four years ago when he interviewed john kerry the two made faces at each other that seemed to preclude a makeout session it was like get a room you guys i just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda call me shallow the daily show has had a long run and there are many likeminded liberals who have a seething hatred for republicans and conservatism i'm not surprised at its success but do that many people actually watch comedy central that guy makes me barf
<START> have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on dvd br br it comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan movies br br unfortunately this film didn't appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects aren't as flash and some scenes seem hurried br br nielsen is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldn't act if a gun was put to her head br br arnie's supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director fleischer who also directed conan the destroyer maybe arnie wasn't confident that he would go on to headline films like predator total recall t2 etc br br some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film i couldn't be so jovial if i was fighting for my life br br all this aside this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining i've seen a lot worse two stars
<START> my first hugely disappointing bbc jane austen flick the tone is off the costumes are off the hair is off the music is from outer space and robert hardy bless him looks like he's really annoyed to be in such a stinker even some of the casting is off no i take that back a good director can make a silk purse out of a sows ear so to speak the performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it's almost a farce of a jane austen story which is ironic since northanger abbey is a sort of homage send up of the early gothic novel i wanted to slap the female lead after awhile who made the decision that she should be such a i had to watch pride prejudice '95 immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth phew
<START> oh my god i can truly say that maya angelou is one of the world's most intriguing and important people especially of my culture she is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman when i first picked this movie up i thought to myself the cast was wonderfully put together now lets see them in action maya angelou is already my favorite and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers i believe she is the greatest of all time this movie had me on the edge of my seat and reaching for kleenex while at the same time reminding me that no matter where you come from if you decide that you are going to be great then you will be great and ester rolle played a wonderful supporting role 100 awesome and now even i know why the caged bird sings
<START> my sister dad and i are really into d d and one night we were browsing netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up we thought we would try it out and i ended up almost dying from laughter the writing and acting in this movie is so amazing witty characters great interaction and hilarious moments kept us in stitches the entire time i love this movie it might not make that much sense for those who don't know about dungeons dragons but nevertheless it is a good movie this only goes to show that movies don't need an astronomical budget and big name actors actresses to be a success check it out if you want a good clean comedy
<START> two stars br br amanda plummer looking like a young version of her father christopher plummer in drag stars in this film along with robert forster who really should have put a little shoe black on top of that bald spot br br i've never seen amanda plummer in a good film she always plays these slightly wacky characters in films that don't quite add up and she does so yet again in this one br br firstly we have two young women sisters who don't resemble in the slightest who allow themselves to be picked up separately by questionable men along the br br amanda's character sandra does at least have a good reason for allowing dr jake robert forster to pick her up in the first place she has been run off the road seemingly by a maniac and her car is pretty much destroyed br br warning spoilers ahead br br however as we go along we realize dr jake is not playing with a full deck any more than amanda is he makes every decision based on the flip of a coin br br when dr jake and amanda arrive at a motel who do we see but the maniac's car and what does amanda do but get inside his station wagon and start snooping around what her motive was for doing this is never clear considering the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her one would think the last thing she would do is place herself in such a precarious situation br br not only does she snoop around but she finds some money and takes it br br shortly after this we have several other things that don't add up br br dr jake with amanda as his passenger runs out of gas and the two of them abandon his car and begin walking one would think crossing a desert he would have checked his gas gauge this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen then later he is seen driving the same car when or how did he get the car back br br dr jake tells amanda he knows she has taken the money now how would he know that he didn't see her do it as far as i know and she didn't tell him she did it br br then later we have a character named santini david thewlis the man who was driving the station wagon give the two of them a lift and i'll be darned if he doesn't know amanda took the money as well how would he know that br br it loses credibility at an alarming rate the further we go br br when alice amanda's sister fairuza balk gets in the clutches of the killer and decides her fate on the toss of a coin one would think she would be very very careful that the coin she swaps for a trick coin would definitely be the trick coin but apparently it isn't br br it's jarring things like this that destroy any credibility this movie may have had
<START> h o t s is one of those sexy 70's drive in movies that features many of playboys famous playmates from the 70's like sexy tall blonde susan pamela jean bryant lisa london kc winkler and the late sexy angela ames and would you believe a post partridge family danny bonaduce its the snobby girls verses the good girls the hots girls led by susan there's a couple of comedy relief gangsters a runaway bear a trained seal misplaced bras etc etc think animal house meets hooters h o t s is an enjoyable little comedy with t a no complaints here i actually think that susan was one of playboys sexiest playmates from the 70's she did do a few more movies including if you like fun drive in movies you will no doubt enjoy h o t s 7 out of 10
