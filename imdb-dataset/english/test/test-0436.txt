<START> this is a truly great film with excellent direction the core plot element the painting of ass is captivating i really can't express in words just how much i enjoyed watching mila getting her ass painted repeatedly br br connor
<START> so it isn't an epic but for people experiencing anything similar br br sibling suicide it might be an interesting way of therapy an br br imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well br br spent for some reason it hasn't really caught on in the audience br br something i do believe is a result of the main theme why did she br br commit suicide clearly this is hardly something that us br br moviegoers will flock to had it been an european production it br br probably would have reached its audience in a much greater br br extent it is however a movie that although the realism tainted by a br br shimmering romanticized glow gives the viewer a whole hearted br br impression
<START> a very funny movie michael douglas' do is worth watching this flick for if for no other reason i'd like to see him do more of these low life roles he was terrific as were all the performers br br the film struck me right off as an american only funnier and easier to watch because it was in american and didn't need no subtitles br br in a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so two of the best were with john goodman not someone i am crazy about 1 he is telling the priest about jewel doing something he liked and says i had to wipe the smile off my face the visual shows he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles but probably doesn't know it 2 the scene at the end between goodman all suited up for jewel in his cop uniform and grappling with the be reiser hunched over a table and the two of them then protesting that they are not gay to another character who happens on the scene this alone deserved a special comedy academy award
<START> this one features an interesting way of handling a camera br br for a dtv movie the version i saw was full screen br br but it falls short on the scenario department first you get br br around 20mn of talk talk talk in a would be hip post trainspotting way then it's slasher city and then comes br br the most dishonest cheat ending i've seen much worse than br br april fool's day where at least it made sense so all in br br all it's the old song and dance interesting director tries br br hard but deserves better movie funny usually it is the actors which are in desperate need of br br something skip it anyway for your time
<START> the women is a cute movie about women at all ages but mostly 30 and their issues in life not just men and infidelity but also about relationships with friends family making time to connect with others problems with image compromising your values accomplishments in life and finding what will really make you happy br br it's also about being true to yourself a lot of times people will give you advice but not really follow it themselves sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves and should you really follow in that same path or react based on your feelings now i really liked this movie granted it was trying a bit to be like sex the city at times but that probably helped me like it the difference here is it's kind of like the discoveries after the stage in life that the sex the city stars were in here most are married or past the point of trying to find a man now they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives br br obviously it's not an oscar contender but it is entertaining and serves its purpose br br and for the men out there there were an equal share of men and women in the movie theater most were with their wives girlfriends and the men were in fact laughing
<START> this norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway apparently committing suicide but the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert he meets a man and is shipped off to a mysterious city where he starts working in an modern office as an accountant the coworkers seem nice if guarded he soon meets a girlfriend yet the city seems utterly strange as food has no taste alcohol doesn't make you drunk and there's nary a children around is this a dream or is he in paradise or in hell while at times the films looks as extended episode of the twilight zone even at ninety minutes the movie seems a bit long it is quite thought provoking the best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration and recoil at discussing deeper issues i always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature and this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style unfortunately the movie ends up a big long and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing
<START> mississippi mermaid is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the wrong person br br truffaut's directing is his usual outstanding work although this is far from his best deneuve is very very beautiful despite the character she portrays
<START> what the heck is this about kelly jennifer seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island she finds this juan p manuel existing and exotic though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face which he also justify later on in the movie right or wrong these two guys are the first to find each other on the island kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house mr handyman they seem to have a great time then billy zane jack characters husband shows up and of course two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous juan p he is a little bit jealous billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world he dislikes juan p for hitting his girlfriend at the pier who can blame him hes also is arrogant but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the waiter everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min wouldn't you be upset yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him but at the same time he is not to be blamed for suspicious about the scuba goggles manuel has kelly and billy just lost some dear friends how convenient he just happens to have them no matter what however for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting manuel and starts to hate billy for being jealous ok billy is overreacting thats for sure but kelly isn't doing much to convince him either she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice and even though manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions but kelly is so forgiving yeah right and then she starts to have sex with this juan p it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other now you can think that this scenario is possible but for real is it are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case for christ sake juan p hasn't really shown himself being a good person catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties is that showing a good side not trying to befriend husband in anyway which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island time simply be respect he doesn't care about their relationship and kelly cant figure that one out he just want to have sex with kelly character is just not trustworthy if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl wouldn't she be upset or what or maybe she is billy zane plays a not very nice person and juan p isn't actually much better if you really think about it and poor kelly is so confused and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p so for all of you who reads this what do you think about it if you where the kelly character would you consider cheating on your husband knowing one day you'll be back in real life and all of a sudden billys maybe not that horrible person after all hes just too jealous and if you where billys character what do you say is he totally wrong in his behavior and juan p character what do you guys really think of him one thing is for sure exist ps the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here what the heck was that about seriously anyone tell me
<START> this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment oh don't get me wrong most of the music back then sucked i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s bands that had some balls forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and i want to die' garbage but the movies from the 80's are the best they were all about nonsense and just having a good time this movie exemplifies that party get naked get laid
<START> i first saw this movie when i was in elementary school back in the 1960s i was fascinated with the character played by ingrid bergman and it was my introduction to the french quarter of new orleans the first part of the movie is the best as she comes back to exact some revenge on her father's wife and daughter her mother had been driven out in disgrace during this time she meets the wonderful clint played by gary cooper the chemistry between the two is great the second half of the movie takes place in saratoga ny the saratoga of the title and i never enjoy it as much as the new orleans setting but it's still very good i give this movie a ten partly out of nostalgia but mostly because it's just a darn good movie and the characters besides those of bergman and cooper are equally wonderful flora robson comes close to stealing the scenes from bergman it used to be shown on tv periodically but it's shown rarely if ever it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles
<START> of adam's apple and with your permission i didn't know until looking it up just now also the wants to kill i prefer this very focused deadpan drama over adam's apple's over the top comedic zeal but with your permission is much more layered and subtle but that's another director br br once the part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again a bit claustrophobic maybe that is intentional it builds on the atmosphere you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the in the br br this is some funny stuff
<START> this film is so different to anything you would have seen before it's an honest and chilling account of an entire family's battle with a terminal illness br br 'the closer she is shot in a very unique style craig films in a very different way using different angles and viewpoints in what i find is a very eye catching manner perhaps due to his experience with photographic works br br his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with br br a very sad but extremely interesting and unique film one i would definitely suggest watching
<START> this seemed really similar to the child's play movies except so much worse a lawyer tries to save a criminal who was convicted of killing his son from execution she fails the lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with his son and is immediately attached to it then after several people are seriously injured they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll saying that she didn't hurt anyone throughout this movie i found myself asking myself ' why am i watching this cheeze ' over and over the end sucked so bad that i went and watched the disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on
<START> humm an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair i wasnÂ´t expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it doesnÂ´t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch troll 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
