<START> alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the vertigo's and the psycho's is this film strangers on a train the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made the story follows guy haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the senator's daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife one day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall and one that could ultimately cost him his life br br the conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time what if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant could this truly be the perfect murder what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his the chances of it happening are unlikely but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train and in this situation anyone could br br is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker the man was simply born for the part he manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in the character of bruno is a madman but he's not a lunatic he's a calculating conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable his performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality unfortunately robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train and i believe that is a great loss to cinema nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does but worth mentioning is his co star farley granger granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against walker also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person and that is how it should be ruth roman is guy's wife to be she isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has alfred hitchcock's daughter patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara the sister of guy's fiancÃ© she is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in br br alfred hitchcock's direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film there is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses this is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene hitchcock's direction is moody throughout and very much with the film noir style the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and i don't think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film it's truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it works there is a reason that hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story but he also uses to camera to do so as well strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema a masterpiece
<START> this is the ultimate kung fu movie this is the only kung fu movie this is the only kung fu movie i have ever seen i am giving this movie way too much credit my best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it so he put a story behind the fighting and people still didn't watch it br br this movie's story line was onion skin thin that acting was goofy and stereotypical of any kung fu movie the dubbing was literally the worst i have ever heard it seemed if you played a small role in this movie like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net it didn't matter who over did your voice it could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything but beside all of this the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes br br the fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about but the of the fights were totally absurd on most all instances a guy either pops out of the tall grass or glances at the main character from a distance and then attacks him but once the fighting started things sort of balanced out there were only two things that really hampered the fighting though those constant sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting very jumpy and choppy someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch but while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else it didn't really affect the overall movie br br in the end this was not a great movie but i wasn't expecting a great movie a great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie's all i saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom i rarely say that but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for so you watch it whenever you have some free time enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it good day gentlemen br br scott
<START> i just watched this movie with a few friends they said i had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse so i can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no real ghosts i feel the worst part was this so called old haunted house contained a whole bunch of new items and a few placed items i could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being flipped over by an unseen ghost or should i say wire then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it flips in a different way uh oh thats a big continuity error if this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other old house items this movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie i would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting effects and cheap video shots of the girls chests and how convenient the camera falls when something paranormal happens this movie is an insult to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape
<START> reading through the comments there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of la pianiste i find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by isabelle huppert huppert is gripping she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge full of self hate and delusion br br the film is wonderfully paced and judged it would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure consider the scene in the porn store for instance somehow huppert is able to carry it off partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable br br don't ignore this film it is one of the most startling and engaging films and performances i have seen br br trust boris
<START> well this movie shows us that mark griffiths and producers think we all are idiots if not how should we understand this br br american pilots take off on suddenly all aircrafts turn to f 16s ha a magic after an action migs land the magic again br br oh did i mention that f 16s had israel markings br br another magic obviously unarmed l 39 trainers are bombing enemies br br and more magic while all movie is situated in europe we can see a desert in almost any flying scene br br maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with br br ok ok this is a movie i should write about its story wait a story yes there is some story in this film and its horrible as well
<START> four things intrigued me as to this film firstly it stars carly pope of popular fame who is always a pleasure to watch it features brilliant new zealand actress owen thirdly it is filmed in association with the new zealand film commission fourthly a friend recommended it to me however i was utterly disappointed the whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution acting is fine but owen is unfortunately under used the other actors and actresses are all okay but i am unfamiliar with them all aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie and pope and owen this film isn't very good so the moral of the story is don't watch it unless you really want to
<START> realty television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and lots of interviews where the members of the crew and some of the locals who live in the town of white plains where most of this film is set talk into the camera about each other those they encounter in the town of white plains their current situations and the showbiz side of their lives the screenplay is often acidic cynical and caustic and killer movie essentially pokes fun at realty television shows featuring a cast of characters one might find on the real world if this plot is attractive to you knock yourself out i found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat out of the cast paul wesley the director needing a big break encountering more than he could possibly bargain for jake tanner is a nice guy coming off very likable and tolerant of the crap he must contend with considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines particularly irksome is his producer lee a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone her poisonous attitude creating much tension she's the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town eruption regarding the killer using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in white plains those familiar with kaley cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess got it down pat because it's the only role we ever see her in most of the time as blanca she's polarizing the way she demands attention milking what little celeb status she has to the hilt manufacturing much friction as she becomes a source of frustration and has quite the potty mouth cuoco may've taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles allowed to spout profanity without restriction cuoco along with the entire cast services killer movie as eye candy but it's hard to find any character you wouldn't want to see hacked to pieces with a meat cleaver jason london is the sound equipment guy a real creep with a sour attitude often tormenting the others with his foul comments that are uncalled for we witness lots of personality clashes watching how these self absorbed hollywood types in the cast snipe at each other the killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone it's quite blatantly obvious some minor gore but most of the violence is shot off screen despite some tame lesbianism not even this is satisfying leighton pops up in the film as a cute victim director writer jeff fisher assembles quite an attractive cast but i wouldn't be able to distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since scream while i've never liked any of characters i never tire of looking at her but eventually she needs to come up with a role that doesn't consist of her preening with smug arrogance always whining and complaining
<START> cujo is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by stephen king br br i've never read the novel but just scanning the comments page has given me some insight i noticed a reference to the change in the ending br br the plot of the movie is as follows a st bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree br br the plot sounds quite worn now having been done in various movies however it might have been something new when king wrote the novel or perhaps king's novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie br br anyway the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten nothing else happens nothing scary nothing funny nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect i found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the tv come on get started the events that i was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a tv movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a tv soap opera unfortunately there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level the dog was the best character in the movie but it didn't get enough screen time in this section there was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later br br after the 40 minute mark point something finally happened the dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine it began attacking some people there was also an interesting cat and mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car unable to leave because the dog would attack them even in this overly long second half the suspense would build up well before dying again it was just a stop go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion br br without giving the ending away i can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a stephen king story br br the suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch some great camera angles add menace to the dog's vicious nature when he attacks people this is particularly important because as others have mentioned a st bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as say a rottweiler unfortunately the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen the music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful this may fit a tv movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer br br this brings me on to a wider problem with this movie the photography the camera work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap tv movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on channel 5 here in the uk where i am writing this comment from br br the top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie's dull segments dee wallace and danny should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given i could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion i won't pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do br br as someone who is a fan of salem's lot and stephen king's it both movie adaptations of famous stephen king novels i had high expectations for this movie but it turned out to be a massive disappointment br br overall i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch cujo this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do
<START> all you could ever hope for if your a jackass fan as always knoxville his crew risk life limb just for our viewing entertainment if you are fan of the series of the first movie you won't be let down like most sequel often do the jokes they pull on each other as twice as funny cruel crude as ever before the stunts dares are twice as rough as any jackass episode you have ever seen if your a fan don't waste time go check it out for yourself because on standards this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for the opening credits alone i can't go into detail without spoilers but you've got to see it to believe it
<START> i have always liked the carry on films with their double meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy but i can see why the critics give this one two stars basically many british people are gathering on a coach to go on a spanish holiday to an island called to the palace hotel what they didn't know is that it is not completely built plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours they have crap draws and many other complications and complaints that the owner pepe peter butterworth putting on quite an amusing accent e g peace sounding like the bad p word starring sid james as vic kenneth williams as stuart farquhar charles hawtrey as tuttle joan sims as cora barbara windsor as sadie kenneth connor as stanley blunt an apparently crap i personally can't remember who he is jimmy logan as bert conway june whitfield as evelyn blunt hattie jacques as a ridiculous hag character not as memorable as her usual matron bernard bresslaw as brother bernard sally geeson as lily carol hawkins as marge jack douglas as harry and patsy rowlands as miss dobbs i admit it is not great but there are just enough dialogue gags and of course babs in the shower and going to to her bum with that iconic whistle and later a rapid rip off of her bra okay
<START> can't believe that cup isn't available on a proper video or dvd yet i've only seen it once on a dodgy copy taken off the tv and despite not being a fan at all thought it was one of the funniest things i've ever seen br br the famous pitch of wherever it was the clueless coach driver this that i'll take the next exit the pointless plot it all added up to aching sides br br being stuck in the us i'm desperate for some good british humour but not quite enough to spend the amount that the production company are asking for c'mon get it out on kosher dvd pronto
<START> two years after leaving the small town of grover's bend due to encountering the brad brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for easter meanwhile the eggs begin to hatch as they cause trouble in the town brown the townsfolk as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town br br the original critters was a minor attempt to rip off the family horror flick gremlins it became a cult favourite on the video shelves was successful enough to warrant a sequel this sequel plays down the horror makes its entire focus comedy instead unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy as well as childish the acting is on par with the rest of the film it is just that the film suffers from a weak script the visual effects are fairly well done br br grade d review by m k geist
<START> it is the first time i can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book in fact only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed br br such as the egyptian slave who had difficulty transmitting um communicating lol or when was played like a quasi sith lord and got annoyed when the roman empire endured a blow the general ordered for the empire to ah watch the movie folks br br i can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in french cinema history and for my part it was worth it was excellent as the roman bashing and boar chomping clavier playing the little indomitable was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of jean reno in just visiting br br the fight scene between and was hilarious and was nice to see the matrix theme was not borrowed to an otherwise perfect battle br br the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for otis' assistant invention used at the very end br br i understand there's asterix and the olympics with many of the same team back by i plan to view that too
