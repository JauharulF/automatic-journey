<START> while the film has one redeeming feature namely some striking shots e g the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree the scene of the funeral procession on the raft or the scene of the boats leaving the village which seemed influenced by the scene when the warships approach in the fantastic fellini satyricon these were more photographic than cinematographic and would have been better appreciated hung on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in a painfully slow paced film that comes in at a whopping minutes and suffers from terrible dialogue extremely poor character development over acting uninspired symbolism and heavy stylisation this is the first film i have seen by angelopoulos and his reputation having preceded him i expected a lot better but can honestly say that this is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i won't go out of my way to watch any of the director's other work in the future the four friends i went to see it with agree
<START> the film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch i am the first one to agree that victor fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy i also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well so what if it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares does every film have to make sense does every film have to be perfect no a person could get razed admitting that they love this film again so what it's got lovable characters it's well shot the acting is mostly good it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic it's quirky look at how many people love i dream of jeannie is it perfect heck no and while this is very different i say check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it
<START> i was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange i was confused sad and happy in the same moment i guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie but i hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it the story of two friends linked by their suffers of bodily disability whom as a team beat the medical well fare system and fight for their rights this movie shows a side which some of us would never understand not too exaggerated but emotional presented hopefully this movie will help us to understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world especially when you almost unable to express that fact
<START> entrails of a beauty features a gang of yakuza blokes gang raping a woman and they drug her and later on she dies and returns as this big slimy monster with a huge penis that has sharp teeth and also a big sloppy vagina crazy film but not very good the gore doesn't come until the last 20 minutes and most of the film is a standard soft core sex with lots of rape worth checking out unfortunately heavily censored optically and nowhere near as much fun as entrails of a virgin
<START> well it wasn't a complete waste armand was as usual very good in the movie the whole turks vs german thing was kind of strange because i remember seeing bulgaria at the beginning of the movie bother to go back and check the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in never saw a movie where the characters looked italian supposed to be taking english american accent and euphemisms with german words the climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me in any case if you have nothing else better to do you can watch this movie
<START> tex tenure as director of cartoons for mgm was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history his cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie the mask eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl impossible stunts and non stop action were the trademarks of these films br br this is one of several droopy cartoons that avery was responsible for and it's among his best droopy is a mountie and he is determined to get his man though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison throughout the film despite many insane stunts droopy keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because droopy is seemingly everywhere full of funny gags and loaded with laughs this is a great cartoon
<START> and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven irish accent of barbara hershey in the leading role of mother the accent came and went unfortunately which i found more than a little distracting br br however the performance of william l petersen in the role of was outstanding he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue captivating and genuine i found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the character br br the premise of the film is fairly simple the building of a forgotten staircase in a church it is based rather loosely i believe on a true story and i had heard of this staircase prior to seeing the movie br br it was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time a floating double helix made without nails or screws it exists to this day although it is now in private ownership br br minor spoiler good supporting cast and barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn't disappoint lots of special moments br br 7 10
<START> the western can be divided into many sub genres one of the broadest divisions is that between town westerns and plains westerns most westerns are a mix of both but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like high noon and rio bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement seldom venturing out into the real outdoors at the other end you have ones like wagon master where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wilderness br br director john ford normally thrived on the bit of both westerns shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined and then contrasting this with the wide open exteriors which appeared both exciting and dangerous wagon master has a typical frank nugent script with some interplay between seasoned oldsters and green youngsters but still it presents ford with some fresh challenges in this picture the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape they come from within the group in the form of the what's more the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time br br however ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space he shoots scenes of the camp or the wagons so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of enclosure as we would in a genuine interior also compared to his other westerns he does not in fact open out the space too much having the wagon trail its way through canyons and passes rather than cross the stark and empty plains one of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outside br br wagon master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the quirky cast harry carey jr was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa and this is one of his better early roles joanne dru was disappointing in she wore a yellow ribbon but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of sass and is actually fairly good here jane darwell who won an oscar in the john ford directed grapes of wrath a decade earlier appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn still with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work francis ford in one of the many mute drunkard roles he played in his little brother's pictures is at his cheeky best br br and now we come to lead man ben johnson although he was by no means a bad actor he was never going to become a big star like john wayne and yet with his effortless horsemanship and easygoing drawl he was one of the most authentically west players around and this brings me onto my final point this was apparently one of ford's personal favourites despite it seeming fairly unassuming wagon master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity it is simply the genre playing itself out i think this is what ford loved about it it's a picture for the ben johnsons and the harry carey not the john waynes or the henry small in scope but worthy in its class
<START> maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't rather than what it is but i approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small town rural gay men and women instead the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry big news of the locals and those in areas and the really gruesome torture murder of a young gay man br br so much time devoted to stupid people squawking about aids sin hellfire and perverts so much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the bible and gay people getting what they deserve br br i wanted to see more of the people that came to the small town gay bar not those who opposed it in addition the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town br br the whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration and it's very suspect
<START> george known as a director of women couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film itself a remake of bette davis' campy old acquaintance written by john van druten this film is definitely dated but still delightful br br bergen and bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything but manage to remain friends liz hamilton bisset is a serious writer intellectual and elegant she meets her lifelong best friend merry noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition later in their lives when liz is a promising but blocked writer of serious fiction merry decides to try her hand at writing which infuriates her pal because of merry's casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously br br much to liz's chagrin merry's trashy novels hit pay dirt and ultimately her old friend liz is judging her novel for the national book award bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph but alas things are never that simple br br the supporting cast includes david selby whom you might remember as the tragic quentin collins from dark shadows hart bochner and of course a deliciously young and mercurial meg ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps br br rich and famous is catty campy witty and wise it culminates in a new years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship and i never let a year go by without watching it on new years eve watch it and you'll see why
<START> warner brothers produced this 3d extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 guy madison leads a band of soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by indians which essentially all there is to this film the 3d format was in its early stages as a hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television and the effects work very well here the rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed the indian weaponry comes at the audience non stop throughout and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown in for good measure madison was quite popular as television's wild bill hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher who is given his thankless task by the army for all the film's polish and presentation the movie was made in just three days
<START> sex is comedy though not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot concentrates effectively on the relationship between film director and crew during the process of film making whilst successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the issues and problems encountered by actors involved in filming sex scenes director features prominently throughout for it is she who carries the plot forward in the place of a narrator and gives us numerous little pearls of wisdom to think about she is a social commentator relating to her assistant and others the problems she finds with her new male lead by way of associating him with a masculine stereotype their ambiguous relationship typifies something about human nature Â the tendency to be fickle on one hand the two seem close when he is not in sight she claims to hate him jeanne also addresses his masculine pride perhaps in a feminist take on things br br the taboo of what constitutes obscenity is raised the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful because it is fakeness which constitutes obscenity that is the director's justification this is however doubly ironic for the film we watch is in itself a construct within a construct br br there's more to this film than just relationships of course watching this film is not simply a question of analysing it for the sake of drawing out some sort of meaning one can delight in the natural lighting which pervades the movie this makes it realistic and believable a static camera is sometimes used taking in a heavy composition and at times the camera appears shaky like a home movie if you're looking for something fun to watch on a sunday afternoon that isn't too heavy but still leaves you thinking this is it
<START> to be honest i did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all i can compare to the first part werner and this one here is really disappointing compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies i watched the last weeks the first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse there are a few good funny scenes but in total it is just another boring second rate try of german film industry that cannot succeed nearly as usual one good thing the movie is quite short 75 min the bad thing it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes don't watch it
<START> i've noticed that a lot of people are taking opera to task for the way betty reacts to the murders i think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a normal person would react the thing is betty is not a normal person due to traumatic events in her childhood she has problems way way before the movie ever even starts and by the end of opera in my opinion she has become totally unhinged br br spoilers you have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother's lover commit at least one brutal murder while her mother was getting off watching it br br she was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked slashed and strangled to death that does not make for a healthy home life i think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never on her it is also likely that at her impressionable age betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw is this just something that adults do etc br br betty obviously looks up to her mother i mean she's become an opera singer just like her if mommy likes it it can't be bad can it mommy can't be bad can she she couldn't tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy br br betty has a lot of deep seated emotional issues her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing but it keeps coming to the surface manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares skull throbbing migraines a dependence on relaxation techniques and sexual she associates brutal violence bloody death with sex on a subconscious level there's an inner struggle between the part of betty that has confused murder sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong br br after she's seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man she calls the police yet is unwilling to give her name the part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call but the part that is ambivalent won't allow her to admit personal involvement the ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way so she walks away from the phone in the rain and when she's picked up by the director she's acting surprisingly calm not as upset as you would think a normal person would be because the part of her that's been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its to block the horror of what she's just witnessed br br the state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within betty's psyche her singing career is starting to bear fruit she's going to be a great opera singer like her mother was but is she going to become like her mother in all ways in the darker ways or will she be able to make her own path add this to the re emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her br br it's not until the hooded man kills daria character that betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer here's someone who loves betty who's supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career who is in fact a maternal figure in betty's life now since mommy's dead imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball br br i could go on but i won't the main gist of what i'm saying is that the character of betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge br br opera is one of argento's best and not just for the visuals alone although they are truly magnificent and not just for the inventive murders although they are there is a depth here and attention needs to be paid
<START> i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier it compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas br br the story is of a 15 year old black kid placed on trial for the fl murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced br br about half the footage is of the trial it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers two public defenders explaining their case interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations this is edited with a minimum of needless repetition and placed in logical order the camera work is pretty solid and there's a mildly surprising epilogue
