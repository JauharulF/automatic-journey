<START> i got hold of a discount copy of this i had seen it several years ago my only recent experience had been mystery science theatre where it was soundly spoofed one never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay i love the beginnings of fifties horror movies they give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the arctic these were there to protect us from the expected soviet invasion but they should come in handy given the threat of very large insects br br this particular one flies for some reason despite its exoskeleton made of the stuff grasshoppers are made of they can still fend off air to air missiles and disable fighter planes br br anyway it's more fun first the obligatory deranged case who saw the flying thing cooling his heels in a hospital it just teaches one see an insect as big as a house keep your mouth shut i wonder if the poor guy got to go home after they found the bug br br otherwise this is a pretty ordinary effort it follows the usual efforts to come up with a way of the stubborn bug and leaves us open to other possibilities the russians next time i still get a kick out of these films and this one is serviceable
<START> not like i went in expecting a lot out of it but i was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie this isn't even that this item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies i've ever seen and believe me i've seen a lot of them bad acting zero characterization little to no thought almost non existent plot and that that's there you can drive semi trucks through the holes in sure it has action and is loud and has more action and more noise and blood and action these things alone do not make a good or even halfway decent movie beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made all i can assume is they haven't seen many i suggest seeing near dark instead
<START> i remember when this show came out it was originally advertised as a mini series at the end of the last episode it said to be continued to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing it ended as it was supposed to so yes you can blame the series for having no ending the plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher but it was a boring show that way too long and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would so they never made any more quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public when the truth is that for this show that is not the case it ended the way it was actually planned to end it is just a lousy ending
<START> i saw this originally on channel 4 uk and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added narration by roy scheider we're going to need a bigger boat this ruined the film for me his droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film and if anything takes from the films brilliance i wonder at the new dvd version that has no roy due to legal reasons would stop people from buying it well believe me the film is much better for it br br cheers br br damian
<START> this film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending but don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly only a little unexpectedly though nothing worth watching the thing through for br br from the taciturn and wronged hero to the germanic baddy to the expendable team the characters were entirely wooden and obvious the two fbi agents smith and wesson geddit gave some hope of humour but that came to nothing br br i am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film a turkey br br
<START> i have seen this movie and anybody who has every been with the marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie it is a must have for any collection jack webb does an excellent job as the hard drill instructor my father went to marine boot camp at camp and says this movie is so accurate that he feels like he is back in basic training there is a line in the movie where jack character gets mad at a boot for killing a sand flea well let me tel you there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp i have been there and can appreciate it as a matter of fact the exit to the camp is las which in english means city of the fleas you must watch the movie to appreciate what i am saying anybody who is into wwii movies all the battles start right here with the drill sgt a must have for you collection
<START> this movie can't decide what it is a soft porno or a sf movie not enough plot for a real movie but way too much for a porno br br in a galaxy far far away a good princess we know she's good because she has long blonde hair wears a white toga is polite and is mooning wistfully about her dying mother when we first see her inherits the kingdom over her elder sister who is evil and we know this because she has dark hair and wears too much makeup abuses her male sexual slaves sneers and curls her lip all the time and talks imperiously about the horrors she'll perpetrate when she's queen the evil princess gets upset and tries to stage a coup but the good sister gets away to earth of course she materializes buck naked in a bar during a wet t shirt contest it really goes downhill from there the acting is ludicrous the dialog sounds like it was written for a porno and the general storyline is ridiculous there's not even enough skin to make happy the sort of person who'd watch this for skin i love good bad movies and this one's not even enjoyable on a bad movie level
<START> this is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts it turns out they all know karate and kung fu the ever wooden cynthia rothrock plays as usual a cynical deadpan good cop this time in los angeles she and her police partners are trying to break up a ring and when that plot line is exhausted the story just switches over to something else and cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy great looking tycoon within the film's obviously rock bottom budget there's some helicopter action some speedboat action some car chases a brawl where cynthia beats up everyone in a country western bar some swimming pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis and a surprisingly good horseback chase about a dozen and a half cops get gunned down a lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense don't worry about them and currency is a federal crime so where the hell is the fbi i guess they were too busy the fight choreography was done by cynthia rothrock's frequent co star richard taylor whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie he also tended to make cynthia a better actress when they appeared together and frankly she could use it she seems tired and bored and does her best acting in guardian angel when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues the dog almost out acts her she also wears some of the most god awful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie loose baggy leg jeans with pale acid washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking the other actors are all over the map you can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way hey me and some other guys i know are going to be in a movie you wanna be in it too no dude i'm serious then there are the slumming professionals the most fun is denier the stunning french model and veteran of red shoe diaries baywatch melrose place and of playing many many other variations on the sexy french bombshell here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in moi or an alias episode and not some direct to cable trash like this there's also the tall dark and handsome daniel now a regular on the bold and the beautiful john o'leary who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here and the veteran arab character actor perhaps best known as pharaoh seti from the mummy and the mummy returns for these professionals guardian angel must be the most laughable entry on their resumes i gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters who are enthusiastic martial arts students both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change they're still a bit too young to care what a low quality picture this really was and just enjoyed cheering cynthia on as she did her legged high kicking stick fighting thing if you like this kind of flick you could probably enjoy it on that level
<START> most of these reviews are dead on so i'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions i've seen on here br br while the characters seem and look young hence the controversy the actor actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier here in the usa that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it br br i'm sorry not to have seen more by sean in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry afraid or confused had a healthy career who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late 2006 she was a beautiful and talented actress br br vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazon com occasionally but usually for a significant price i've seen it as low as 60 or so and as high as 152 as of this comment there were two for that price the sequel video paul michelle is not quite as pricey and can be obtained when available on amazon for between 16 and 70 on average
<START> j carol nash and ralph morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a daughter when his advances are spurned he injects the father with a disfiguring disease so that she will be forced to come to him to get a cure br br god this is awful its dull and boring and you'll nod off before the pianist gets i was on the verge yea it picks up once things are set in motion but this is one of those old movies better remembered then seen again br br if you must see it come in late br br 4 out of 10
<START> this was truly a tense and dark episode excellently executed wonderful acting and atmospheric directing is one of my favorite episodes along with and 'home' these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case it seem quite realistic to me their paranoia their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors however had a problem that i got over after a few watches it was too short i wanted more br br overall had what 98 of all x files episodes have excellent acting intense story writing gritty directing all the works br br 10 out of 10
<START> unreal after reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers i was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews 38 all rated this film a 10 upon comparison with other great films these reviewers felt that the quick and the undead is a better film than the 6th sense 8 2 saving private ryan 8 4 lord of the rings 8 7 godfather 9 5 gladiator 8 1 and dawn of the dead 7 8 to name a few hopefully these shills utilize their next discounted procedure that they hear of because it is completely obvious that these reviews have been br br i was led to believe that this film featured a unique concept in the genre of zombie film making sadly upon watching the quick and the undead it is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who either were involved in the production or have a vested interest in the films marketability financial success nothing cements this in my mind more than hearing that a portion of this film was shot in texas were coincidentally allot of the early posting praising the film are from the zombie film horror b movie culture on a whole is a forgiving group but this film is sadly beyond any redemption the characters are recycled and the plot poor the film quality was not bad enough to be labeled camcorder and at least they used a film quality camera the acting is horrible the star trying unsuccessfully to come off as a clint eastwood wanna be clone christ on a bike even the lead actor's name is clint he was just terrible the only resemblance to clint eastwood is that the lead is using the wood from eastwood's name in his style of acting the zombie makeup was above halloween party quality but not applied completely to the full undead cast members allot of zombies were not made up on their hands the plot was so hokey that it had me hoping for a power outage a blemish on the dvd disk or that the zombies would turn their attention on the director maybe the film has worth to some viewers but not for my hard earned dollar luckily i used my free rental coupon to check out this dvd maybe this film will be rescued by nott entertainment aptly named releasing a special collectors dvd which will tie up loose flaws and deliver the promised goods some how i think nott lets just hope that their next release the flesh keeper is truly a keeper of a film and not a 5th generation recycled version of the texas chainsaw massacre fingers crossed here folks but only if you care
<START> note i've tried not to give away any important plot twists or the ending but if you're concerned about that please think about viewing the film before reading further thanks br br this was obviously a fairly high budget production released by paramount the story follows the supposedly true exploits of man jack shepard in 1700's london he was a who got blackmailed into a life of crime by the nefarious thief taker to save his brother's life after being double crossed by the thief taker we turns into a sort of robin hood type figure and gains the support of the common folk he proceeds to make escapes from several prisons including the infamous newgate as well as having time to entertain numerous noble ladies br br i really enjoyed the film even though the plot was a bit predictable the film was shot in and wicklow ireland and the sets were very well done and seemed realistic i think captured the bustling atmosphere of london in the 1700's quite well and i enjoyed his creative use of camera angles and unlike many films depicting this period pulls no punches in showing us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived in one scene several folks fight over a meat pie that has rolled through the filth in the street br br overall i really enjoyed this film i will admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and underlying political commentary that clavell's next film the last valley has a parable to the vietnam war but it still merits a viewing or two it is regrettable that it has not ever to my knowledge been released on video or dvd
<START> brian keith as cole and richard jaeckel as wade matlock make excellent villains they just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible and sneer sexily at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends it's a pity that goody goody glenn ford gets in their way
<START> i never read the book now i don't really want to i had no clue what this movie was about when i walked into the theatre i still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across but i do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life two precious hours i can never get back br br the storyline was so predictable it's laughable werewolves or something a very romeo and juliet type plot i predicted the within five minutes into the movie and i was correct br br the acting isn't horrible the only two cool characters in the movie were the british cousin guy and the rambo graphic novel the other characters are too the dialogue is very bland and predictable br br the absolute worst part of the movie is the transformations between the humans and the wolves if you wanted something kick ass like van you're gonna be really upset imagine a bright light then a wolf yep that's about it br br just avoid this movie period especially if you've read the book because you'll just wanna punch babies
