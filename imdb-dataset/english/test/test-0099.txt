<START> i don't believe it sixty percent of voters voted this show as ten now how the hell is the rating a five point eight it impossible i don't get it its totally pathetic i mean how anyway the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting definitely a ten out of ten from me i think the creatures are cool they look great and i wish i had a great show great cgi hope there's a second series as a lot went unanswered in the first season and when is gonna get any bigger as the rest of the creatures are huge again why is the rating so low when the votes were so high br br 10 10
<START> a couple of days ago i saw the awesome house of sand and fog and i was impressed with the amazing performance of ben kingsley in the lead role i decided to see ray trying to understand how and why ben kingsley did not win the oscar of best lead actor after watching jamie foxx in the role of ray charles i agree with the academy he really deserved to be awarded i like ray charles i was not his fan but it is amazing the resemblance of jamie foxx with him the film is completely supported by jamie foxx who participates of most of the shootings and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of ray charles with regard to the story i saw the extended version on dvd too long but also very pleasant with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie ray charles my greatest surprise was to find that ray charles was heroine addicted and how he treated his own family the presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie my vote is nine br br title brazil ray
<START> the 25th hour was a movie i just chanced upon tuning in late at night this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire film tony quin is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman and by simple jealousy goes on this incredible journey terrific movie and a hidden treasure
<START> childish storyline ripped off of a lame hollywood movie terrible acting cheesy dialogue and not quite up to par sex scenes that's right another great softcore parody i enjoyed this film greatly sure the acting is terrible but that part of the fun the storyline is ludicrous but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl on girl sex scenes and because it's only softcore no penetration the sex scenes were a little bland but it's like the great god of softcore smut russ meyers said who really cares what goes down beneath the waist i don't know if i'd agree with mr meyers on this one but what the hell the flick entertained me for an hour and a half i give it a c it would've been a solid b if they coulda cast more of the girls to look like russ meyers actresses
<START> ok enough already this is a terrible piece of television the camera work is appalling do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world anna massey is 'acting' in such an unbelievable fashion and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond also the bertram girls aren't pretty enough and the guy playing henry crawford is awful to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement i watched this adaptation over christmas and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time br br i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie but see any other adaptation instead even emma is better than this
<START> i was initially excited about this movie and fully expected it to be a combination of and farenheit 451 unfortunately i was continually disappointed in the lack of depth and interest of the plot and subplots midway through the movie i divulged into poking fun at the characters and sets to avoid having to turn it off i did enjoy the premise of a future with merged cultures and separation of the and have nots what could have been an artful and intelligent look at the future is morphed into a plodding semantic scifi channel midnight flick with horrible acting cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of tim robbins vagina maybe he should stick to his socialist political ranting it has all been downhill since shawshank
<START> no spoiler needed to steer you clear of this well bizarre film canada becomes part of the usa ok so i guess i'm unusual but i expected something about the implications of canada becoming part of the usa silly me continue with this movie and you are off to cloud land the opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will trust me not care a squat for any of the characters slings and arrows and due south have to be among the most imaginative series ever but in this case paul gross i'm so very sorry to say didn't have a clue about making a coherent film and wasted a lot of talented actors in the process a real disappointment
<START> absolutely the most thoughtful spiritually deep intense hamlet ever done no other version comes close jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it patrick stewart's claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic i particularly like the two doofuses playing and guildenstern very feckless and yet sinister some might gripe about the need for a strong ophelia she's not a strong person that's the point and ward hits the proper nuances amazing simply amazing every one of the more than two dozen times i've watched it
<START> the sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be and it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy br br this is not a movie that will win an academy award but it does take what made the jackass tv show and original movie a success and it turns it up a notch it is funnier more brutal and more disgusting than the original and i loved every minute of it br br the original had a few notorious stunts and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for you will wince cringe look away and laugh very very hard br br in any event you probably do not need to read this review or any others to know if you will like this movie unless you have never heard of jackass
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen the story line is a joke the effects are terrible the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest people just don't act that way in real life situations my question is who would fund such crap br br the movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes one guy falls and breaks his leg or something the fireman arrives to help them meanwhile somebody starts a fire some more bike stunts bla bla bla br br i wasted my time br br do not watch this movie
<START> a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent director mark dealt with the potentially sob inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival australian film veteran sam neill was as always fabulous in the role of frank's uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying you know bert newton matt's dad get out and see this movie
<START> this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief br br it's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert his hapless nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chase br br the thing about the film that appealed to me the most however is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition br br this thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides lars solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone br br heartily recommend
<START> the main word that comes to mind when considering this film is dodgy this is a low quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time the gloved one deserved better br br before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic i have to say that there are two things i found effective first was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations i feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was severely lacking throughout the rest of the film second was the sequence depicting the courtship of michael jackson and lisa marie presley i will not comment on whether i believe the marriage was a sham but by many accounts it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved that really came across in this film flex anderson and krista rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off these successful points are enough to keep man in the mirror away from 1 star status br br that said there was very little else here that worked very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray most those playing elizabeth taylor janet jackson and diana ross also the absence of jackson's music was a huge loss how can you effectively tell a story about him without his music i understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low budget unauthorized production it seems though that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him you might as well pack it up and go home because you're missing out on an extremely important part of his life story br br this film's characterization of jackson bothered me a little too i won't argue that he was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled i don't believe that jackson known to have been a shrewd businessman would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as he was made out to be in this film br br finally the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny like michael and tinkerbell exchange or nonsensical like the blanket of love comments made by michael also the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety there was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events what could possibly go wrong sorts of lines and extremely overt hammering of themes and motifs in the film if i'd heard the word believe one more time this is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad br br perhaps when we are a few years or even a decade or three removed from jackson's death someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving film by that time we might have a better perspective on his life and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful examination of who michael jackson really was and what he's meant to the world of entertainment this very dodgy biopic was not that film
<START> first i'm sorry for my english second the true story of this episode 39 soldiers operation 6 soldiers were killed hundreds of insurgents were killed too within 10 years the soviet army has lost less than 15 thousand person and killed over insurgents and civilians there is no insurgents without permanent help of usa the veteran of war traditions there are no traditions in this film there is no military oath there is no first jump no farewell to the fighting banner there is no delivery of awards and medals there is nothing sacred there is only a hatred to soviet army being in this area on investigation we have revealed start up jet shells by insurgents an exact place could not define so gunners have asked to give easier square also have covered it through pair minutes here it was the reality of fights so there was no feeling oblivion these feelings have appeared then already on other war and in other state others were children more kindly more humanly and were as fathers well and culmination fight full orgy shooting in anywhere mental attacks young ben not killed both not broken through and full absence of mutual aid that there was a main thing on this war even americans accused us of inadequate application of force against insurgents and here it is direct on the contrary in the summer 1981 i about myself have firmly solved that personally should fill up a minimum 50 insurgents as a result accepted plan has been under fulfilled and on a i departed strongly and malicious as fig after returning the first months there was a feeling of that i not was at war up to the end not business there have completed all how follow there was any vague but an oppressive sensation of discontent with itself and caustic irritation such here night ideas can be and out of place at all officers really in film are not present absolutely in occasion of that what is the time they spent with staff on fighting is constant new year on fighting from where did they take beds in mountains and so on br br if you want a fairy tale about war 9 and is for you if you want truth you must see come and see or ask for fire
<START> after an astronaut dies in space he is brought back to a military base inside the man are discovered alien embryos he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion this film comes to us from director bernard l kowalski who also directed attack of the giant leeches see separate review but may be better known for his work on columbo executive producer was roger corman known as the creator of much better films than this one particularly in the 1960s br br this movie is cheesy and poorly constructed what comes across as interesting is the poor effects not the actual film itself one scene shows a close up of the alien embryos and it's an embarrassing cartoon representation even for 1958 and then when a full grown alien appears you'll wonder why he is wearing shoes or if you're really perceptive you'll wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other movies br br by no means is this the worst science fiction film you'll ever see and you almost have to give it some credit the alien host overtaking a military base idea predates both the thing and alien by a number of years i don't know if these films were inspired in any way i doubt it but at least it was ahead of its time beyond that though the film flops and is only great for heckling when drinking i haven't seen the mystery science theater version but this sure is one film worthy of their insults
