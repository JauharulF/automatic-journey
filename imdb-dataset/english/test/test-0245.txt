<START> i regard this loving and sensitively written story to be one of the screen's true masterpieces after having seen this film originally on the silver screen with my mother in los angeles california when it first came out many years passed before i would have the opportunity to experience it again the beauty quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me set it aside from many many others of its kind yes tears still come to my eyes when i see it and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song perhaps still today my number one all time most beloved film i would hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations
<START> capt mandolin is an old fashioned hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity and supposedly no americans the story takes place on a greek island during ww2 the italians arrive to take over the island but with german supervision there is a romantic triangle made up of a greek couple and the italian captain nice performances by all the actors penelope cruz's best work yet
<START> i was like watching it right and i was all like oh this is so totally awesome full and then i was all like ya quite good indeed so i really enjoyed all the amazing dangers and all the british people and i think that the doctor is very a good doctor in his way of doing such wonderful doctor y things and he was a very strange man and i was like maybe i won't like this guy because hes a new doctor and i like the old doctor thats not this guy but then i watched him and i was like oh this is awesome and i liked it so then i watched and enjoyed the great evil enemies and the great conquering of the evil guys and the happy doctor who is quite scary and happy looking
<START> i really only watched this movie because it had rupert in it who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie i loved the entire film rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow i can't wait to see more of films in the future julie walters also did an amazing job in the harry potter movies she has a very small role so i didn't quite know what to expect from her either but she was wonderful as dame the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious overall an amazing movie
<START> i was 13 when this mini series and its sequel north and south book ii first aired i had already been captivated by the personal interest stories in around our american civil war which is what interested me in watching this made for tv program br br i loved it and now i'm 29 years old and i only love it more it is full of history beautiful costuming real life characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters all of whom you come to care deeply about there is intrigue love loyalty betrayal family extended family lust battles victory defeat and reconstruction br br even though i had the full set of episodes on tapes i recorded back when it originally aired i purchased the full set of both n s and n s ii from columbia house some years ago when they became available once every few years i'll take a whole weekend and watch all the installments back to back and am sad when the last episode rolls to an end because i find myself wanting to continue watching the story of the lives of these characters br br i cannot recommend this mini series more highly
<START> i would have given this less than a 1 rating if it were possible the entire film should have been left on the cutting room floor what a pathetic waste of time money and effort let's see assemble the prettiest cast you can find which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up and viola an abominable piece of trash that the director and or producer should be ashamed to put their name on how much worse can the horror genre get and don't use low budget as an excuse i have seen many great low budget films in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget if you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror film then for god's sake don't make one at all
<START> one night randy matt dillon rescues jewel liv tyler from her jealous boyfriend utah andrew dice clay he takes jewel to his home but utah comes back and wants randy to open the safe at mc suddenly a shot dead then better stop here to tell the plot thatÂ´s like to explain the story of wild things what i found so interesting was the fact that the plot written by stan his first and his last work he died in july last year was told from 3 perspectives the 3 men that fall for jewel everybody of them sees her from different eyes like john goodman as the detective who tenderly falls in love with her because of being remembered of his dead wife br br no wonder that the guys fall for her liv tyler sheÂ´s a real jewel she made the big screen shining she played her role as if she was in a noir thriller sweet but in the same time she was the cool vamp who walks over dead and uses the men for her needs and of course michael douglas how could i forget him mr the bingo playing killer he was quite cool br br but in the last 10 minutes there was a little bit too much slapstick for my taste it weakened the atmosphere that part began when paul reiser as cousin carl on his leather dress for jewel the ymca song didnÂ´t fit so much here but altogether one night at mc is a pretty cool film noir parody br br
<START> i just don't get it why call this a sequel to the film american werewolf when it has absolutely no connection with it whatsoever the first film was funny and scary with ground breaking special effects if memory serves the oscar category for special make up effects was created for this movie paris is none of these things awful effects and not much else do not see this movie rent the original werewolf in london instead you'll be much happier
<START> belonging to the subgenre of post apocalyptic future films it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment the most noticed element of the film is its silence no one speaks i don't think despite what is evident in most of his later work meant it as any kind of cool gimmick i think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion no matter how slight though i wasn't glued to the screen upon reflection i see that it's a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature its vehicle is the stylized sci fi movie part of its reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of its humans is not necessarily played as a perfect human being the hero a lone drifter in the desolate new world is taken in by an older recluse who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a husky brutish character played by jean reno and so reno tries everything he can predominantly using brute force to get what he wants so the antagonist is right though not a good person and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong though they are both good people br br it's shot in a clear and crisp black and white edited and captured in a low key yet spry and small scale approach and its actors are very real how can they not be they like their characters are left with the bare necessities of communication this is one of the few truly good films that luc has written his earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he churns out now
<START> this movie was so heart warming a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams never give up hurray for the stand in
<START> please let me know of any versions of precious bane or gone to earth on video that people may be aware of i love the books of mary webb wholeheartedly and would be very grateful to have any information on either vhs or dvd br br i've read precious bane and gone to earth which are my favorites by mary webb many times and have collected other novels by her also i was lucky to have found her springs of joy poetry and essays but i've never been able to see the precious bane version that was on masterpiece theatre or the full version of gone to earth although there was an american movie classic airing of the wild heart which was a chopped up version of gone to earth's original film br br if anyone can assist me in obtaining copies of either or both of these films full versions i would be so thankful
<START> it's too kind to call this a fictionalized account of the barker gang they got the names right but that's about it br br russell is still hot i'll grant you that but this is not the real ma barker who basically took care of the boys by cooking and assisting when they moved around the country not by planning or participating in the crimes i think it would have been far more interesting to present the real story of a middle aged woman caught up in the criminal activities of her children and their cronies br br i also have to agree with those reviewers who found the shoot out scenes to be totally unbelievable the barker victims were a combination of the innocent and of the law enforcement agents who pursued them but they definitely did not mow down half a dozen fbi agents every time they were cornered on the other hand as several recent books have related the fbi of that era emphasized the idea of agents coming only from legal or accounting backgrounds to the extent that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearms experience they were not the well trained agents that we picture today br br but the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore nobody changes nobody grows we know the end of the road is ahead we just don't know which shoot out it will be br br only for die hard russell fans
<START> neil labute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films in the company of men your friends and neighbors with this funny and original thriller comedy road movie when betty renee witnesses the brutal murder of her no good husband aaron she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia and flees in his car not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk morgan freeman and chris rock are the hit men who follow her br br what betty is chasing besides a new beginning although she can't remember the old life is her beloved dr david greg kinnear only problem dr david isn't real he's a soap opera character on the show a reason to love' and he's really an egotistical actor named george mccord br br to say any more regarding what develops would be too much but nurse betty is certainly original its hit men are like the hired killers of pulp fiction are violent yet philosophical its take on soap operas terrific spoof material and its acting is the best feature of all this has to be one of the best cast films in recent years renee is perfect for nurse betty with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest morgan freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career and chris rock is his partner a man of rage and great impatience greg kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor soap opera doctor there are also great supporting performances from actors such as emmy winner allison the west wing harriet harris frasier's agent bebe and kathleen chloe on er actually the supporting cast is a who's who of television best character actors br br a unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next nurse betty is a mix of great acting casting and a terrific screenplay
<START> a gritty presentation of the decay of family values and human dignity in the wake of soviet communism 1988 film little vera is a landmark film of modern russian cinema brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitized idealism promoted in soviet times as in circus moving the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight a contemporary ukrainian setting further intensifies the effect first by the immediacy of the film to its time period second by its of a locale not only struggling for identity in lieu of a soviet system but also as a nation distinct from the russian idiom that had dominated the u s s r br br vera the film's title character and protagonist is a rebellious adolescent girl with a dysfunctional family including a hard drinking father and a mother care worn rejecting her would be beau andrei vera begins a destructive and primarily sexual relationship with a college student named sergei despite her parents' dislike for the lazy sergei and despite rude contempt for her parents he moves into their cramped apartment tensions escalate until vera's father drunkenly stabs sergei vera must decide if she will stay loyal to her intolerable family by testifying her father acted in self defense or continue to support and defend the ever detached sergei br br unbearable in almost every imaginable way little vera masterfully captures and communicates the inescapable void left in social life after the collapse of communism the sexual aggressiveness of the film it was the first film to show explicit sex combined with the unrelenting presentation of social reality a marked distinction from the socialist realism demanded by stalin effectively confronted the conditions of former soviet life most interesting however was public reception while many wrote hate mail to the director and star the film was wildly popular here the double edged nature of film as social criticism emerges if done correctly the film will make the audience uncomfortable because no easy solution presents itself some viewers will hate the film and filmmakers for bringing up the issue many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this regard larry clark's kids harmony korine's gummo even popular movie's such as john hughes' breakfast club br br i recommend this film to those viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours excruciating domestic conflict and social miasma is not overly daunting the film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly challenging despite the difficulties of watching the film some moments within it are profoundly beautiful of course the socio historic and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked and in fact operate as an even more assertive reason for watching this film
<START> as i don't have a tv and had never heard of this mini series i didn't know what to expect from the second coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis which sounded interesting br br dear god every pun intended if someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year olds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play i wouldn't have been surprised br br why oh why did they decide to portray jesus mark ii as what amounted to an idiot savant is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this okay an ordinary bloke but a great northern moron i don't think so br br apparently all jesus did to impress people was his miracles because according to this take his preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone certainly without the night into day stunt mr jesus eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe a paddle or any kind of following at all br br and the odd little gay polemics put in willy nilly without rhyme or reason other than of course russell waving to his fan base jesus turns up in the pub to recruit more gormless northern losers and of course the gay writer's standby the harpy woman nag nag nagging away gay rights are rammed down his throat to no real purpose almost like russell thought he it to the to put jesus on the spot br br i can't really see the real jesus coming out with well i've nothing against it personally mate only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine jesus to be quite this wet br br and don't start me on the ending come in and eat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if god br br it was like an eddie izzard sketch of god as bill gates hello i'm bill gates and now you've pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style i'm going to give it all to you my customers and eat the rat poison of course br br i'm often mystified by the ratings on imdb but the high rating on this one takes the biscuit br br never mind jesus for the new millennium this is jesus for brainless mtv lads br br god help us all indeed
