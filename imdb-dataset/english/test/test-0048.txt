<START> this is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's and this one is even better nene and are all back as the knight sabers in their hard suits battling the robotic boomers the animation is crisp the characters are well developed and the action rocks is a singer in her regular job so the series features some wonderful songs as well there is a fair amount of violence but most of it is against robots and there is some fan service but nothing too racy the dvds also have many extras including commentaries which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show a must have for any anime fan br br also recommended burst angel armitage iii
<START> i was just lucky i found this movie i've been taking advantage of walmart's 5 50 dvds because i watch a lot of movies and very seldom watch television i graduated from high school in 1968 so i have family and many friends who served in vietnam this movie really illustrates the pain i've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there i wish more people would see this movie i think maybe more people could understand what happened to our vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war the story felt realistic it isn't mushy but made me feel what they were going through i think it helped that martin sheen and emilio estevez were playing father and son it made their relationship more believable
<START> from a military standpoint nearly everything in this movie is historically accurate beyond that it is an enthralling story that leaves you depressed at the end but quite glad you took the time to watch
<START> and i do not understand why the show gets so much beating in my opinion this show really is excellent well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode which seems to be typical for a steve moffat sitcom i would rate it among the best sitcoms britain has ever produced br br the show itself is a farce at its best it is not along the lines of fawlty towers but you definitely can rank it as high as a black adder coupling or the young ones i am watching the first season and all i can say is that i am happy i bought the dvd br br the problem probably with this show is and why it got smacked so hard according to the internet that the original press release compared it to fawlty towers and everyone was disappointed it was not well even green wing is closer to fawlty towers than this show all i can say is clear your mind from every prejudice give the show at least a run until including episode 3 and then decide for yourself br br all i can say is thanks steve moffat for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off
<START> where should i begin with this movie all i know is that it is a mess be the script story or the actors first of all this movie is very disappointing from salman khan who gave us a fun hum le jayenge and har dil jo pyar karega before this second rani is getting really annoying appearing in every stupid movie since hota hai glad saathiya stopped this nonsense the story is stolen from the wedding singer but ruins the funny movie the dialogues are lacking i may have laughed here and there but entertained no salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies but here he is insane his character is poorly written one minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor rani mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort she luckily redeemed her career with saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time pooja put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough jackie is wasted shah's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script raveena tandon looks beautiful but puts little performance mohnish behl gets the award for worst supporting actor they need razzie's because there have been terrible movies in india he says stupid dialogues dances terribly looks weird and is not in his regular form just to tell you there is more to the cast who are also terrible if it weren't for awesome beauty in aa meri life bana de i wouldn't give the movie a point otherwise the dancing by salman was terrible pooja was dancing like a wind in otherwise i wish the costumes were given a make over and the rest of the cast and their monkey dancing had been blown away from the wind the good song of the album was o priya o priya which doesn't have a good enough picturization same goes for the half way decent title song otherwise this movie and the rest of the songs are a no no for everyone
<START> edge of madness is a tale about a woman in the 1800's who gets hand picked by dirty scotsman who can't keep his penis in his pants he just so happens to have a younger brother who is against rape and kills him but continuously says it was an accident this makes his wife go crazy she gets delusional and she takes the fall because she loves george too much br br like i said this type of thing has been done before this is just more artistic because it's canadian and it's an indie production done on a low budget with hardly known actors except that one kid from lassie yea he's in it i whether this was going for oscar bait but it was sure as hell boring and this is based on a 40 page short story half of that short story is incorporated into this flick and i'm glad otherwise i'd bore to death unfortunately i had to watch it in my media fundamentals class and i had an assignment on it read the short story and compare and contrast the flick to the story boring br br you know it's harder to answer movie questions when you don't like the movie ah well i hope this is the last type of assignment me and my class get for what it's worth annie was totally hot she had a nice soft ass and i liked the nude parts of her in the movie br br 3 10 for boring oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality plus nudity
<START> don't worry when looking at the cover of the dvd sandra bullock only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic the entertainment value here is very high br br to name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to br br the doubled evil voices of the chief bad guys the special gun cam the weird masks and outfits of the hit killers the showy ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground the abundance of bottom up shots the spacey scene in which bullock falls unconscious on the street the over clichÃ© italian mob guy moe the cheap synthesizer background music the mesmerizing overdone gun fetishism br br and last but not least the super corny fist fight scenes wish there would have been more of those br br extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud
<START> continuing his comeback john travolta played a mildly twisted angel in michael he may be a messenger of god but he's not the nicest guy as reporters andie macdowell and william hurt discover when i first saw this movie it was before i had started watching all in the family so i didn't recognize jean stapleton as edith bunker now that i recognize her like that i try to imagine archie snapping at her for harboring an angel whom he would probably rank alongside blacks jews etc br br i know that doesn't really relate to the movie but i just like to associate things that way anyway it's a pretty interesting movie also starring bob hoskins teri garr and richard schiff br br what john and paul said
<START> a poorly paced sf horror venture that takes itself much too seriously memorable only for a the beautiful mathilda may wandering around naked through the chaos and b terrible miscasting it has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments and some unintentionally funny scenes but is mostly a waste of time
<START> saw this movie at a saturday matinÃ©e with a friend theater was about 70 full br br although there are quite a few funny lines it is more of a drama suspense with humor sprinkled on top robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura linney being a daily show fan lewis black is pretty good in this christopher walken gives a good performance also br br the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie suspense in a supposed comedy movie i know that i as well as everybody else in the place was struggling a bit with this a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater br br in all fairness after the movie was over there was smattering of applause so definitely some people enjoyed this movie br br i gave this movie a four out of ten because i believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense drama movie and the actors performances while not bad were just decent br br again this movie isn't what was advertised
<START> i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that god's army was okay and i thought that maybe had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders mormon missionaries and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that portrays and it becomes almost laughable br br only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflects reality missions are nothing like what shows having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity br br the conclusion which i'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable c'mon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time try making a movie that someone can identify with
<START> be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving over sexed jocks there isn't a thing redeeming about carrie 2 the plot is absurd the acting terrible and the ending all too predictable br br i wasn't expecting a masterpiece but i was expecting to be entertained i wasn't the only way i could rationalize watching this movie was because i was at a relative's house while waiting for my car to be fixed unless in the same predicament stay well away from this film
<START> i'm normally a fan of mel gibson but in this case he did a movie with a poor script the acting for the most part really wasn't that bad but the story was just pointless with flaws and boring i thought i would like the movie a little but i didn't like it at all actually i give it a 1 1 2 out of 5
<START> well i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother daughter relationship film br br beautiful film
<START> the most irritating thing about dies august days is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon unless mentioning name a few times constitutes an homage this pretense is an utter fraud you will learn virtually nothing about in this film nor about the spanish civil war 1936 1939 nor about the special role of catalunya in that war you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco br br the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful of course but dies does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue the large number of stills shown not very illuminating images of the forest floor for example is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema on the contrary one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced out middle aged hippies don't waste your time read a good book about the spanish civil war instead i recommend felix scathingly anti stalinist revolution and counter revolution in spain which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising br br barry freed
