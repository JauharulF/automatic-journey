<START> there are certain horror directors for whom i've built up so much respect admiration over the years that they can't possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film lucio fulci is surely one of them but damned he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late 80's and simply watch cat in the brain instead because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than seven other fulci flicks including the sickest murders sequences featuring in when alice broke the mirror as a whole this movie definitely ranks among our director's weakest and most pointless achievements the script is incoherent as hell the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there's absolutely no suspense to enjoy i love the title but it's actually quite meaningless there is a character named alice in the story but it's only a supportive role and she certainly doesn't break any mirrors i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice as she's an opera singer but she doesn't the plot revolves on a middle aged and gambling addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money lester parson butchers the ladies as well as unwelcome witnesses in gruesome ways makes out of their body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat there's also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him the difference between when alice broke the mirror and some of fulci's greatest horror films the beyond city of the living dead Â lies in the fact that he totally doesn't bother to create a horrific atmosphere the characters lester included are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted like it's the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car the lighting is poor the cinematography super ugly the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable if i didn't know any better i would think lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it the obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore bloodshed because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn't work properly as long as lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women's feet when alice broke the mirror is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment but other than that there's isn't a whole lot to recommend
<START> checking out is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be jewish judaism plays virtually no role in the film but american jewish culture behavior gets thoroughly sent up it a loving way i wish the movie dealt with the religious perspective on the topics it explores because i think that would have been interesting br br i've never been a columbo fan so i wasn't familiar with peter falk he's a lot of fun to watch it's great to see judge reinhold laura san giacomo david paymer again why don't they work more they're all hilarious the script is terrific with a lot of memorable one liners i'll be sure to use with my own family watch for gavin mcleod captain as the doorman
<START> this is a great movie to watch with a good friend boy girl friend or family basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones without all the girlie crap you find in a lot of american feel good movies this movie is light hearted but makes you think and will make you laugh br br just a really simple but universal plot would think most people could relate in some way to this movie the characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie and the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life jewish humor i watched the movie for the first time last night and now i want to own it
<START> not to waste your time watching this vanity project i've had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the suspicion that someone involved with gone isn't happy with what i had to say so i've pared things down to the nitty gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary br br gone is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words horrible stilted dialogue a script that just plain about like a fish out of water acting that would embarrass the most self centered of community theater divas cinematography inspired by the survivor school of swooping crane shots followed by static nostril exploring close ups terrible adr work special visual effects that aren't pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades no art direction to speak of the litany of badness just goes on and on i felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it time that could have been better spent staring at a wall under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this movie because long before it's over they will be wishing they had been raptured before they made that mistake br br case closed amen
<START> jenny lewis plays an awkward girl called jade she smokes and drinks she doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother beverly d'angelo jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend billy rob estes maybe she is attracted to him of course i don't need to tell you what happens after that br br this is probably my favorite tv movie this movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame this movie also has the best acting that i have seen in tv movies beverly d'angelo does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but neglectful and blind mother she couldn't see what was going on under her own roof rob estes is at his best here as the sleazeball jenny lewis is the standout she seems to be exactly like her character br br everyone seems to love this movie
<START> what the hell was this i'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or the number 23 everywhere he goes but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell for crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller i would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get we just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid life crisis and his journey to redemption kinda like an old man flick if you ask me i probably should have just rented wild hogs it wouldn't have made a difference i mean who are we kidding they should have made someone else the killer of that girl by juxtaposing sparrow with the protagonist of that book the number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along how would that have shaken our heads shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who concurred with my reaction
<START> great piece of fiction played as if factual tonight i was looking at the birdman of alcatraz robert was not a model meek prisoner and he was in jail because he was pimping and a customer did not pay up once he got into jail he was so uncontrollable he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital killed a few people in prison too this movie reminds me of the birdman of alcatraz but even worse robert stroud did write books and he did contribute to society in someway and the boa had some hints of lunacy but this guy henry young who murder in the first is suppose to be about was a a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more then one robbery he wasn't some poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store which just happened to be a post office and took some money this man was a hard core criminal he also killed a person 3 years before he went to alcatraz he killed another person in jail not because of the solitary confinement which ended over a year before the murder the real story of his life would of been more interesting they did not even get the warden thing right you can't be a warden in 3 different prisons at the same time and by all accounts the warden in the movie was a pretty stand up guy as wardens go plus if my math is right the warden played by karl malden in the boa is suppose to be the same warden in this movie oh boy not only that in this movie we are to think poor henry committed suicide and he wrote the word victory not true he might be alive right now he was sent to springfield where robert stroud was also a medical center prison then walla walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped parole in 1972 never to be found maybe he is hanging out with that cb cooper guy who jumped out that airplane in washington state after committing a bank robbery lol now the acting was very good kevin bacon is in that class of actors which include jeff bridges and dennis quaid the vastly underrated actors club gary oldman well they just might of made up the warden part so he could play it because he was great christian slater still somehow sounds like jack nicholson i am not sure if that is a good thing or not bacons wife kyra sedgwick was in the movie i think just because she is his wife i like her though but not in this flick for some reason i felt this movie when it first came out was suppose to be a special project for kevin bacon i feel he could of taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system there sure is enough of them and spread some light on their plight other then picking a psychopath to show as a victim
<START> very disappointing and incoherent every now and then a germ of an idea would develop and be discarded in the next line it had the feel of a film that had been cut and re cut to try and make it work i was bored and distracted all the way through and i'm speaking as a huge fan of the series many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired the medieval section went on far too long and the quality of acting was very poor some on the tiny guest spots like simon peg and liam cunningham did more in their alloted 30 secs than the main cast did in 90 min's br br it's a shame really br br the only really interesting thing was getting a look inside the little shed on soho square which is something everyone who is ever in that part of london wonders about
<START> it seems that all people didn't like steven seagal just take a look at his nomination list there are only razzie awards nominations with one win for him but i think he didn't earn anything of it i saw good movies with steven seagal i saw bad movies with steven seagal and the patriot 1998 is one of his best movies nearly as good as under siege 1992 or hard to kill 1990 the patriot shows his activities to protect nature surely this movie is not a great one and i must say that there is more violence than i like and why must seagal's best friend l q jones die the death of a victim the role of dr is one of seagal's best performances he has as always a very good charisma and in summary the patriot is good entertainment and with an average rating of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time br br regards hans dieter
<START> the film is a joy to watch not just for the plot which is gripping but also for the superb performances of the actors deneuve and belmondo though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is i will not spoil it with saying what though it is divulged fairly early on belmondo is lovable as the fairly but in love tobacconist i would recommend this film to all truffaut or deneuve fans it is a brilliant hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does the film is approx 2 hrs so you feel that you have not been sold short deneuve steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film truffaut was very much smitten with her a definite must see for any cineaste or 10 10
<START> i cannot stress how bad this movie is this director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so distressed why are their clothes so dirty why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head you should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life buddy giovinazzo br br i take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke why would you ask clark kent to play a crackhead why are they yelling so much why is everyone so mean why are those kids so filthy no one would want to be so filthy not even a crackhead child br br you need to grow up and not make any movies ever again
<START> i thought this movie was horrible i was bored and had to use all the self control i have to not scream at the screen mod squad was beyond cheesy beyond cliche and utterly predictable
<START> there seems to have been some money behind this film but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if i hadn't actually started watching it br br to begin with once we are in the cavern with the characters the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s the film is shot almost entirely in close up since the actors are wearing helmet lights this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness we never get to see what the characters see so when they shout out look there we are left to beg what where ultimately the film has a nauseating confusing strobe light effect with no sense to it until we get to the end br br and i won't tell you what 'the end' means but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old early '60s arch hall laugh fest with richard kiel br br but what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like 's long remembered as one of the worst films ever made but that's what we have here folks except that unlike the cavern is not anyone's idea of goofy fun it is unwatchable i ran it at x2 the normal speed just to get it over with hoping i would actually be able to see something by the end of the film but when i did it was just stupid this film did provide me with one satisfying moment though since it only cost a couple bucks after i got it out of the dvd player i was able to smash it with my own hands what a relief
<START> usual awful movie i'll not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core armageddon an evil planner military officer and one or two solve all nukes and you'll have the movie if i can call it that way br br seriously nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives br br the big one is approaching nuke some places and it's over a tornado wants to destroy insert important city name here nuke insert another important city here a volcano is erupting nuke it a nuke is near to go off nuke it coffee is cold nuke it you didn't like transformers nuke yourself but i can't assure this will fix things br br in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke
<START> now i do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some indians have concerning their women and sexuality i have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society with women being murdered because the husband's family doesn't want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing i also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in india a decade ago as a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film br br although i am a male am not rabidly feminist and i am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and man haters in fact i don't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands yes i use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their sexuality in many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence br br one husband married a vivacious young woman sita out of family obligation this arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband however he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about sita and he continues to have an affair with a liberal minded chinese lady to make matters worse he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies in their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met and unfortunately he could have cared less br br another husband was married to a lady who was infertile radha oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever it's because this man has decided to become an i e in hinduism a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment now his wanting to do this was all well and good if he was not already married and had obligations for his wife however being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care the closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh this must have brought nothing but frustration to her br br so you've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs eventually these needs bring these sister in laws together at first just emotionally but later sexually as well the movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation br br late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from radha's enlightened husband a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible br br this is a very challenging and adult film while there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady as i said this is not a film to let your kids watch however for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think br br the film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which i found rewarding the only serious negative i cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape this is because although the movie is in english the accents are quite strong at times and it's not always easy to understand what's being said but and this is the worst part there are no closed or open captions including them is a must for western audiences if you do watch this film see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning mine sure didn't br br by the way director deepa mehta a popular female director has made several other wonderful films such as earth and bollywood hollywood a consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectations and with a strong emphasis on female characters not surprisingly this west thinking lady makes her home in canada and is divorced a truly unusual woman to say the least for a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture try another canadian gem eat drink man woman
