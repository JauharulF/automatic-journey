<START> daft potboilers don't come much than this but it's a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesn't based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor it's got more uplift than a bra br br rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in love br br try as i might i can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk's films this one isn't too deep on the plus side rock hudson isn't half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap opera terms this is definitely daytime tv
<START> i just purchased an running out of time on dvd and it was an excellent film i must say not really action packed in terms of gun play but definitely exciting and witty i do not think i have seen andy lau in better form and the editing on this film was very well executed go watch this now if you are a fan of lau or hk action film
<START> fans of horror comedy will like this one others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off it's sort of a buddy film with over the top violence and gore deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of craziness br br it looks to have been made on a budget of about 100 by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party there's a lead who's a frustrated nerd and his loudmouth prank pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second there's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles which is the highlight of the film whenever this thing and its gnarly mask wearing driver appear it's a great scene there's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars the nerd's friend never shuts his and gets them in one mess after another their arguing got on my nerves but other aspects of the film make up for it br br sight gags poking fun at several psycho tormenting and trying to somebody films are everywhere take your pick which one is riffed the most hills have eyes saw and jeepers creepers were some that i recognized br br it's enjoyable insanity if you're in the right frame of mind sensory dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together
<START> is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis where is their bob denver do they even have a dwayne hickman a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself and they do and say uninteresting things this movie is unbelievably bland the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven not the usual of dark smelly hair but bare armpits does not a good movie make was funny so was la cage aux and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy
<START> the movie angels of the universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget e g american beauty and blair witch project the director fridrik fridriksson gives the novel a new life on the white screen the movie is a breakthrough in icelandic film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in iceland br br the music in the film played by is very symbolic for the film it is absolutely brilliant i recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible you won't be disappointed i would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year Â all over the globe
<START> this movie was a major bait and switch i rented it because of rebecca st james a popular christian singer i have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a ufo movie well br br i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend or a friend of a friend my first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when i witnessed the special effects of the ufo encounters cheesy as the movie progressed i noticed how plastic the actors were it was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors there are a few exceptions br br rebecca was disappointing she is always found in the house and doesn't show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the fold doesn't she ever leave the house br br i had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it i hope that rebecca doesn't believe the message of this movie believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell jesus spread a message of love and hope his message inspired others to change out of love not fear

<START> as with many sequels this one just doesn't have the quality or the impact of the original the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats this one just doesn't cut it the first film had a magical good time feeling about it that is totally missing from this film we became enamored of all these characters minus richard dreyfuss in an age of innocence now a few years later they have changed so much that they are largely different people while this is what happens in real life we don't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters the film doesn't have the humor that the original had and we were expecting to laugh what little humor is there is dark the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever while this one is good but not even close to the original's this film is so totally different from the original that it isn't even actually a sequel i gave it a 4
<START> when the long running 'happy ever came to an end its characters june were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel although their surnames were changed from fletcher to br br terry has received a new job and as a result he and june move to where they end up in all manner of scrapes unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment the boss inviting himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at d i y but cocking it up each time a fellow imdb user branded this show as 'not and 'never well fair enough it wasn't clever but that was the whole point as for 'never well some of the episodes were pretty substandard i will admit but overall i found it to be extremely well written highly amusing and very well acted br br it was warm hearted slapstick not dissimilar to the later b b c sitcom up eight different writers contributed to the nine series giving the show plenty of scope terry scott was a comic genius as he well proved in productions such as i' the on' films and of course here june whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right br br i enjoy some modern shows i e 'still game' 'the catherine tate show' and i even enjoyed the comedy' 'naked video' 'the young ones' and 'the comic strip but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy such as this humour that you don't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up for the record was wonderful stuff special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well
<START> general is a super being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the enterprise a lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening and seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder he seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment though a few hundred years out of date in which to play out his fantasies the environment is subtly inauthentic and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies pretty soon it becomes clear that is not just an immature god but a very fallible one regardless of how you feel about this one stick around for the twilight zone like ending it is well worth it br br as many have pointed out character inspired the more developed and amusing on going character q and you can see in john construction of that personality more than just shades of campbell's it is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with q all deal with him so radically differently
<START> i quite enjoyed the wrecking crew 1999 which was the last of the three films in this series the first being urban menace 1999 which i've yet to see i know it was baaaaad but the three leads did a pretty decent job all things considered br br this however was truly atrocious ice t was dreadful and he's the producer can't say i've ever heard of the shocker who apparently never learnt how to spell but his performance was one of the worst i've ever seen in a movie br br miss jones did pretty well in her small role though she later went on to make some atrocious racist jokes on her radio show after the se asian tsunami plus other occasions sadly way to go girl br br no one else comes out with any credit strangely tj storm and ernie hudson who are both pretty bad here are far better in the wrecking crew which was made along with urban menace at the same time as corrupt how that works i don't know br br i'm going to try the ice t commentary now to see whether he apologises for the film or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film making
<START> fool for love is one of the several now forgotten films robert altman directed throughout the 1980s this one a screen adaptation of a sam shepard play that features shepard in the lead role just simply isn't very good altman made many not very good films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his but here i think the fault lies with shepard for writing such a flimsy play altman's direction is assured the performances are o k given what the actors have to work with but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting there br br shepard is eddie a stuntman who has a love hate relationship with may kim basinger the two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man harry dean stanton who may be either a figurative or literal father to both eddie and may quietly observes randy quaid rounds out the four person cast as a gentleman caller br br the only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that eddie's and may's relationship is incestuous however this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything the screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes shepard and create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes stanton and quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots br br the last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when eddie's and may's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone somnolent voice over br br chalk this up to another of altman's experiments gone awry br br grade c
<START> this may well be the worst remake hollywood has ever produced and that's saying something i'll take it further than that and say this movie is so stunningly deliriously bad that it must be seen i don't know if i'm even capable of tackling all the things wrong with it like the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat or the mind blower of richard gere's character being allowed to walk away scot free at the end i'm sure the people saying it's just fiction who cares would have no problem if it was a former al qaeda operative who just wants to return to his home country so i'll just devote my review to the utter hilarity which is mainly the scene where bruce willis is testing out his gun br br in the original version you'll recall the practices his kill on a pumpkin the pumpkin explodes on impact an effect known as understatement in this version willis sets up a pumpkin target but he doesn't use a sniper rifle he uses a gigantic remote controlled cannon which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous this man likes a challenge he reveals the cannon by pulling away a tarp at which point jack black who is there to observe jumps around and says that rocks this thing rocks about 18 times i guess willis didn't have to disassemble it first he just lifted it tarp and all out of the back of the van despite it probably weighing several tons the scene then turns into an austin powers movie as willis misses the pumpkin and takes out a tree then has black run through the mud with his pants falling down finally blowing off black's entire arm the pumpkin falls to the ground unharmed br br if i can recommend this movie for one non ironic reason it's for the diane character as a tough russian major who becomes romantically linked to gere despite having a facial disfigurement a bold move for a hollywood feature by mid movie i was really liking this character so it was a shame when she had to be killed i would have liked to see a movie about her other than that this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test 3 10
<START> let me waste a moment of your time to explain how i approached this film 1st i dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of aliens which i consider to be one of the weakest films in the alien series stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after i heard positive things about it from people whose opinions i trust i missed the theatrical run completely i then became hooked on farscape in its 3rd or 4th season at the time and found pitch black on cable one night around bed time so i said oh why not at least it has claudia black in it soon i recognized keith david and began to realize that vin diesel radha mitchell and cole hauser could all act why this should surprise me i do not know i was captivated i have now remained captivated for four years i just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time and i still love it br br this is not an art film not an independent and its not entirely original but where it fails to break a lot of new ground it utterly succeeds in providing interesting realistic characters hard driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot and non stop entertainment an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects sound to good to be true don't take my word for it see it for yourself br br the film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic vin diesel introducing the character of richard riddick diesel would go on to star in the somewhat riddick chronicles thereof which i also enjoyed though recognizing its rather huge flaws and is now something of a legend diesel is so charismatic so big and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor but a smart one too checking out the dvd version of pitch black with the audio comments on might just blow you away br br the film is about the crew of an inter system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash landing in which their captain was killed the new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic mitchell but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities a bounty hunter with secrets hauser and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark diesel is that all of course not the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry br br as unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be pitch black is beautifully filmed well told and very nicely performed don't expect to learn anything and don't expect to have to think a whole lot but do expect to have fun with this modern sci fi action classic
<START> recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the dvd made me realize that this was a local movie the word detroit in the title furthered my and i did some looking up of things and yes a local movie it was br br so i picked it up someone i knew actually knew some of the producers director dont remember which and said the producers directors got people to pay to be in this movie br br brilliant what a great idea the movie makers get some capital to do the movie with thanks to their cast and crew then the investors cast crew others get some of the profits i'm imagining br br profits br br um anyways this film totally underwhelmed me the special effects were special as in special children who ride the small buses to school the acting was very amusing not intentionally however there's a great line where a guy says well this bone aint gonna smoke itself as a pickup line unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film the story well i sort of followed it about 3 5 of the way in then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it it suddenly ended i mean as in no resolution of anything like they ran out of time sorry folks out of time goodnight br br we sat there baffled and booing and threw in another film then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine showed up with one of the guys from the movie we threw it back in and he the actor gave us a running commentary which was awesome because he totally ripped on the movie br br what more could you ask for br br the most absurd scene for me was a motorbike chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all that and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl in pain the zombies looked less like zombies than my coworkers do and i dont work at the morgue either br br so i recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the fun br br otherwise give this one a pass rent something like if you want a jaw droppingly bad in a funny way movie
