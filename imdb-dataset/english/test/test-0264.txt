<START> this two character drama is extremely well acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments shocking not because they are graphic but because you're not prepared for them when they come but eventually it does become oppressive just like the somewhat similar a pure formality did still alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi dimensional performance no doubt about it 1 2
<START> this film was bad was it meant to be a comedy as i couldn't help laughing the whole way through it what a waste of two hours donald sutherland was wooden not that he was alone everyone else was just as bad and how miscast was linda hamilton
<START> i'm a fan of zhang yimou and finally found this dvd title from the shelves of a bookstore after a long search at many places br br this is a huge departure from previous zhang yimou work esp in terms of style and locale the director himself has said that this is the first and only time he'll ever attempt to make a black comedy set in contemporary china you may even say this work is experimental in nature compared to his other well known big budget and formal pieces br br filmed with a hand held camera and wide angle lens throughout the duration of the whole film the quick pace editing and high energy performance naturalistic tone never let you go once it grips you from the start it presents a very realistic account of modern chinese urban sensibilities which in this case is set in beijing if you appreciate and love this kind of black humor you will love this film totally also look out for hilarious cameos by zhao happy times and the director zhang yimou himself br br a last point of note i find the characters in this film as in all other zhang yimou films exhibiting similar personality traits stubbornness always trying to beat the odds up the ante do let me know your thoughts on this br br david lee
<START> i had this movie given to me and have to admit i am glad that i did not pay money for it br br the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle with 2 women trying to seduce her but the reality in this movie is far from that br br in reality the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all br br even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things which the box tries to compare this movie to were riveting because of the unexpected turns and suspense br br but jaded has none of this it concentrates on the and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them and the of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true br br while it does show that same sex rape is possible it is not a movie worth watching br br if at all possible pass this movie up at all costs
<START> since others have complained about putting sherlock holmes into a contemporary setting i won't do that basil rathbone could have fit in in any era with that voice that savoir faire this is a nicely put together mystery based loosely on the dancing men one of the best of conan doyle's stories instead of the original plot it makes the men part of a nazi plot holmes becomes a spokesman for the british war effort his adversary is moriarity who seems to die frequently enough to rival the central figure in the friday 13th films he is certainly creative but the rathbone holmes is unflappable watson is just along for the ride in this one he isn't given much stupidity to spout in this film and that's a real plus the plot is complex enough to keep ones interest there is a concluding speech that is almost a parody of itself but then i can't be critical of a time and nation that was under great duress if they needed to call in holmes so be it
<START> the movie is excellent acting cinematography direction and music are spellbinding it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original 1937 version starring ronald coleman that movie for good reason engendered an unbelievable level of commitment from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out i believe the impact was something akin to the first movie in modern times i have seen it it was and is wonderful but that does not mean that this version is not also worthy from the first scene the 1973 version grabs you the noise and tumult are fantastic especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of shangri la and burt music is beautiful so by all means enjoy the 1937 version but do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 king kong destroy peter jackson's of this year
<START> a group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each other br br you've seen it all before and this one is too low budget and slow paced to be scary and doesn't have any real surprises in the climax no special effects or gore to speak of in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the english dubbing which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie br br 3 out of 10 pretty low in the pecking order of 80's haunted house movies
<START> what the beep is going wrong with disney the last years are there totally run out of good ideas where is the magic where are the good animators the good songwriters the good directors the good okay i know walt himself and the famous nine old man can't come back but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney i never rent or bought a disney sequel of what movie however because i had read much enough about its absence of quality but atlantis milo's return was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it it confirmed my doubts about sequels it was absolutely boring flaw animation primitive color rotation simple characters some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous camera with cgi mediocre music and a patchwork of different simple stories it looks absolutely not like disney not like disney i know it looks like one of the countless cheap and simple animation series like dragonballz etc that aired every day on tv for children br br my first reaction after showing this crap was to load bambi in my dvd player to see disney's immortal magic depth spirit and charm again to see disney on its climax again to see the awesome art of handmade animation again bambi was the first and until today the only movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars but atlantis milo's return no magic no depth no charm no spirit it deserved only 3 out of 10
<START> while most of wayne's b efforts are entertaining in a fun way this film is so sloppily edited and written it is a dud the first ten minutes alone show wayne and bandits in nighttime scenes intercut with stock footage obviously shot in the day plays a half white half apache bandit with a heavy mexican accent and he cannot seem to pull off any nationality i give this a 3
<START> a bunch of full length movies featuring the muppets created by jim henson co have been made but the muppet movie was the first one of them all and the first in the original trilogy which also features the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan it was released seven years before i was born so i obviously didn't get to see it at the time nor did i get to see its two successors when they were first released however i saw a lot of the muppets during my childhood mostly after henson's premature death in 1990 i finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid nineties after hearing the soundtrack unsurprisingly i liked it at the time and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing br br one day while kermit the frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing rainbow connection a hollywood agent named bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in tinseltown kermit takes his advice and goes west he soon meets fozzie bear an unsuccessful stand up comedian in a restaurant and convinces him to come along the frog is also noticed by doc hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants kermit to be his mascot as a frog kermit is disgusted by this so he refuses and leaves with fozzie on their road trip across the country kermit and fozzie meet other muppets who join them including miss piggy who soon becomes kermit's love interest and gonzo unfortunately as they all try to make their way to hollywood doc hopper assisted by max is willing to do anything to force kermit to become his restaurant mascot so kermit finds himself in increasing danger br br one thing many people praise this film for is the songs and i can understand why there is of course the oscar nominated rainbow connection at the beginning and more good tunes follow such as kermit and catchy road song movin' right along and i'm going to go back there someday a poignant ballad sung by gonzo never before never again the song miss piggy sings when she first sees kermit is the only one i would consider rather weak and their romance seems awfully sudden the muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on tv and some of them provide a lot of the humour including fozzie making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand up and well if you're familiar with these famous muppets you should know what to expect from each of them some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as dom deluise as bernie the agent and steve martin as the insolent waiter also it's not 100 comedy there are serious parts of the film which they also did well br br watching this original muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing muppets from space one of the muppet movies made after henson's death released in 1999 for the first time last year i was very disappointed when i saw that film which had never happened before when i watched any film or tv show featuring the popular puppet characters not only is that movie not very funny i also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the muppets as i stated in my review of it however i can't say i think the same of any of that movie's predecessors including this one released twenty years earlier the muppet movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch and since it has so much to like not just for kids that's understandable i highly doubt there's much left to say about the muppet movie that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years but today it remains good family entertainment
<START> based on the true story about christopher boyce hutton and lee penn and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the soviets during the 1970s boyce works for the government and his job is to guard these particular documents which ultimately him about his country's affairs and practices he then enlists his drug dealer friend lee who has become a wanted man to be the courier for these sensitive documents lee infiltrates the russian embassy in mexico and makes contact with alex suchet and they both begin to play the espionage game br br lee's interest is purely about money whilst boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in alex believes lee to be the inside man in the american government things start to become array when lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both alex and boyce lee becomes more paranoid and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved br br this is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action the character motives and analysis of real life subjects is sympathetic but very well written and the film cleverly interweaves the real life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations well directed and intense in parts especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game timothy hutton and sean penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system the plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'the falcon and the and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society human relationships and the american system great film br br 1 2 out of
<START> i don't get it i just don't get it barney and friends has been lambasted by millions through the years and i will admit i was one of those any child who watches this show doesn't realize that what they're watching is just a piece of trash barney is very annoying and very selfish add baby bop and it gets even worse add b j then you have a very creepy television nightmare then you get the children they're old enough to know what barney is trying to teach them what are they doing there in the first place it would be funny if barney and his friends appeared on the jerry springer show that would certainly be one of the wildest moments in television history even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it as we have seen less and less of the more informational and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and the 1980s what a big difference a selfish son of a gun makes when this show leaves pbs a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people but a huge dent will have been made in the annals of television history a message to barney himself you may not realize it but your days are numbered br br in a nutshell there are other choices better choices
<START> although a well produced made for television movie dying to love you reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor br br the film opens up to roger paulson tim matheson looking much older than i remember him to be who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty lonely life after his wife ruthie who looks suspiciously like roseanne arnold leaves him with the quickness now all roger has is his cats and his ad in the newspaper br br once his ad is answered he calls johnnie elaine lisa oh it doesn't matter i'm whoever you want me to be lawrence then they have phone sex br br i'm not sure where you're from or when you were born but i remember that phone sex bit was played out by the late '80's i'm sorry but that was trashy br br soon roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance they fall in love visit the zoo to see gorillas and then have some kinky sex with roger's son in the other room she ties him to the bed and seduces him br br roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that johnnie is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around god forbid women only sleep with one man soon enough strange phone calls begin to occur johnny girl wants roger to marry her with absolute quickness and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex husband who used to beat her it's funny to see roger believe her through all this stuff that's until a frumpy co worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife he takes her crappy advice and lo and behold he finds a suitcase crawling with fake id cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow he immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested even though all this jazz he still loves the dumb broad she tells so much lies it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once br br roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named angela who looks like something off of gremlins 2 she has a child as well and roger takes quite a liking to her but something inside roger's subconscious keeps him connected to lisa if that's even her real name and he keeps going back to see her br br now lisa is the ex that won't go away as she earns herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at roger's doorstep and his son matt is so busy trying to check her out he pours juice all over the floor il' is so stupid he throws lisa out and doesn't even change the locks boy if all people were that stupid i wouldn't even be writing this review the ending of this movie is so corny you won't believe br br tim matheson is a made for tv movie king he just looks like such a mummy in this movie he's a little wooden and stiff the dazzling tracy pollan works well with her role and her rings true she is extremely beautiful and i do see what michael j fox sees in her br br this movie is great to watch when you're on that late night tip but then again you might fall asleep considering how dull and bland it is
<START> personally i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation maybe the greatest this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges it can't be bad and that's exactly what this movie is k pax is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story it's part of what makes the movie so great the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting the combination spacey bridges really works br br this was already the second time i saw the movie and i'm sure it won't be the last time k pax has everything there are moments which are extremely funny parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high class drama i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards great movie br br 9 10
<START> in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club the people who think that there is anything real about this legend need to grow up this is the 21st century guess what ghosts don't exist most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old you guys seriously need to grow up br br the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesn't do it either go to college or at least finish high school
