<START> i was disappointed with the third film in the death wish series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into bronson he is his usual self in this one maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t v the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a team but not on the big screen even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness the plot is something out of an episode of highway to heaven and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from bronson's revenge against the bad guys skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend
<START> the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie i can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing if not for the die hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see everything from that era otherwise don't even waste your time on this br br the story is similar to most films of its type something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage been there done that truth be told none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality so i can't see the point in harping on the film simply for this br br but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences i've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this this one just fails to create any real suspense the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi professional directorial touches here and there but they mean nothing if you're not frightened the gore is pretty tame as well so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed br br the movie manages to along rather dully honestly the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals because let's face it we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots but the pacing whether due to the script or the editor is all off the murders are spaced out at odd intervals leaving us with some long winded scenes no doubt meant to build character that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill which as i've said usually isn't executed all that well anyway br br as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening he or she wears a jogging suit a fencing mask and his or her primary weapon is a sword i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original cool murder weapon but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly there's also not much emphasis placed on the nature of the film as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off br br i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable and at times it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era but alas the attempt fails for the most part there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film there is attempt at characterization but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end so what a waste here all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough br br in the end if you're really into these old '80s slashers by all means check it out if only to say you've seen it there's a completest in all of us but don't expect to be blown away or anything what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all
<START> thats not saying much this killjoy film has better cinematography and is more professional looking than the last that doesn't mean it's more professional sounding that horrible last film was about gangsters killing a kid and then being haunted by a voodoo clown i thought the guy that played killjoy in the last one was a bad actor but wow this killjoy is honestly the downright worst actor i've seen in any movie and i've seen a lot of movies last movie the clown came in about 15 minutes in this one's shorter and the clown doesn't even come in until 40 minutes in and it's only 65 minutes long i give it a 2 because the acting from some characters is ok
<START> this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound it was based on a silent movie called steamboat bill jr starring buster keaton back in this early mickey short mickey did not talk nor did he have gloves he could just whistle and play music the song that he played was turkey in the straw using several barnyard animals as musical instruments he plays a cow's teeth as a xylophone and he plays a nursing sow's like an accordion keyboard captain pete however is very mad and makes mickey peel potatoes in the galley pete's parrot flies up to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes mickey throws a half peeled potato at the parrot and laughs thus closing the cartoon i was able to get this cartoon on tape and i really like it i think the disney shorts are much better than the feature length movies
<START> this was an excellent movie i saw this at the vary iff in the czech republic and it won an award there this is the first film i've ever seen from jan the director and i was impressed it's a great story about love and family the movie has a great balance of comedy romance drama and suspense all in one i will not give away any of the plot but this is a well made film and i would watch it again if i had the chance the cinematography editing is great the film simply flows and the characters are warm and they are the kind that one can relate to i hope you can enjoy this film as i did if anyone knows where i can find this in the united states or if they plan on releasing it on dvd anytime soon please let me know
<START> steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor and i loved planes trains and automobiles and bowfinger but bringing down the house definately isn't one of martin's funniest works and it doesn't even seem as if it's trying to be which is just plain sad br br i don't know maybe i didn't like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with harry potter and the chamber of secrets and phone booth both of which are excellent films or maybe it's because i'm used to so much better from martin or maybe it's just because i'm in a frickin' bad mood today regardless this film just wasn't very funny or entertaining and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film's gags which is really a shame since the previews of this comedy were so promising i was expecting bringing down the house to be an all out comedy bash and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter racial laughs from martin instead we're to seeing queen latifah jiggle all over the screen trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character the funniest thing in this clunker is eugene levy but even he doesn't get the screen time he deserves br br i would've really liked to enjoy bringing down the house but i didn't and i'd find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most die hard steve martin fans skip this one and rent planes trains and automobiles instead br br you'll have a much better time
<START> what a truly moronic movie all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his br br you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this only to be disappointed to find erm no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing at the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you that'll be 11 95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way don't get me wrong i like weird movies 'the could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie despite casting j lo who i dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to sway my opinion this isn't one of those movies and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say oooooh what a masterpiece the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity when in actual fact all it is is bird excrement on a board br br keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie br br thanks for reading
<START> this was on showtime the other night and i figured it was going to be another made for video crap fest like earth vs the spider or any of those other hbo horror shorts instead i found a comedy gore classic it was legitimately funny and surprisingly the acting was quite good even my wife an overall horror hater agreed and was laughing at parts in addition the fx were high quality br br overall the film felt like a parody of joy ride jeepers creepers and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead definitely worth watching but don't take it seriously br br the end
<START> if you love movies about fruity dudes who prance around with a top hats and while spouting off random line of poetry while stabbing their victims then this is the movie for you br br if you like movies where it looks like the whole thing was shot with a camcorder and when people get disemboweled their internal organs are made out of baked ziti an sauce this movie is even more for you br br and if you simply love movies where the acting and dialogue sucks so much that it makes you feel dead inside then for god's sake run to the video store right now and buy this movie right now hurry go before it sells out
<START> awful in a whole new way anything but love probably should be seen by movie buffs if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a vanity production i am guessing a vanity production since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent free and not particularly attractive non singer actress as isabel gold in the leading lady role for yet by the likes of lookers like cameron bancroft and andrew mccarthy except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie her singing leaves much to be desired and yet unbelievable as it is all the other characters in the film think she's terrific there are a few moments here of actual charm or humor but very few otherwise this is a silly sad fiasco that veers from paint by numbers to paint by wrong numbers you know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says my kid could do better than that well this is a movie the likes of which your or anyone's kid might do better
<START> having finally been able to get the dvd of this 1997 hbo film is at down to watch it by the time i finished it the old saying those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it was echoing in the mind first shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers and four years before the events of 9 11 path to paradise reveals the series of close encounters blunders and official in decisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them br br path to paradise features a nice cast of believable actors peter gallagher and marcia gay harden lead the cast as fbi agents john and nancy floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their nypd counterpart lou napoli paul art malik andreas shaun and tony gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack all of whom play their roles not as potential clichÃ©s but as real living people and make the film all the better for it of special mention is ned eisenberg as salem the man whom if it had not been for skeptical fbi officials could have potentially informed on the plot br br the film is also well produced despite being made for cable this film doesn't feel like a low budget film at all with its production values particularly in its sets and new york city locations the film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times when all of these elements are combined with the script it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events taking place all the more disturbing br br the most disturbing thing about he film is its script the events of the film are true minus some dramatic license which is always necessary and in hindsight are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago the film reveals just how a group of men were able to smuggle a bomb into the world trade center they did so thanks to the lack of arabic translators government agencies failing to pass information to each other the fbi ignoring leads from a source and police departments being unable to pick up on clues worse then investigators to connect dots is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 9 11 attacks to take place but in some cases such as the lack of translators are issues that continue even today even more chilling is the ending which really did happen and looks all too prophetic today br br path to paradise is a film that should be essential viewing today the film is not only well acted and produced but teaches us a lesson we should have learned sooner the lesson of the film that those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it if you can find this film then watch it and learn from it
<START> contains spoilers br br but if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother she spends her time drawing but wait for it then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime therefore being drawn by pain so clever the story itself is actually ok but it's just how it's done jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man while her dad who sports a great moustache just walks around the house all day while looking angry just showing how bad the characterisation is especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase no more while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface the following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion the episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes but oh no jesse doesn't want this little jesse is out post modernism as if he'd just eaten donnie darko and then himself to death pointless camera jerks all at weird angles overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes in conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great i just wanna hug his lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft the character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another but all in all mainly s t br br indiana jones 4 however is much better type into you tube as well the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes mostly gay ones
