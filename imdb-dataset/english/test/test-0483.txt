<START> hulk hogan and zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i'll never know why if not for vince mcmahon's money this stupid film would have never been made maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling no holds barred is not that movie
<START> since frame number 1 you know the good guy in the suit and necktie is he has no luck sorte nula or so he believes with that music on the car radio and the dubious talk by his best friend and company associate who is taking him to parts unknown through a desert road alberto wished simply to be left alone to take a flight abroad next day withÂ well someone we're left guessing br br the film goes a long way Â that'll find short Â to a closing scene with the man hearing the same music on a cab to the airport in between a number of lucky people have found different ways out of the story some dying some being born others falling into harrowing distress this time he's really or is he the film is a sort of one man show by director fernando fragata who only left the sound recording and the special effects to other competent people those who typically reject portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording must go searching for other topics to criticize this time the car crash this isn't spoilers the film is too clever for that makes for a great scene and apparently was done with cheap equipment us studios take notice you may spare a dollar or two by hiding competent portuguese directors br br the rest was done by fragata from the script to the dialogue from camera work to editing if part of the dialogue were ad libbed then he again must be congratulated for the acting direction and the casting with mostly inexperienced actors a large number of non speaking parts are credited but most of those people were used for the music video clip and the making of used extensively in the film's promotional trailer the cast has a dozen actors and actresses of whom ten relevant persons and a huge number of relationships Â that are revealed step by step in a thrilling suspenseful way reminiscent of the best genre authors qv and qv do come to mind by the cat and mouse play between the director and his public and the nature of his characters br br i recommend this thriller and comedy to portuguese language speakers and if the film gets to have a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue to anyone abroad who enjoys those genres
<START> the journey is a romantic version of the cold war it's about an english woman deborah kerr trying to smuggle her former love a hungarian scientist jason robards jr out of hungary during the hungary revolt in 1956 she's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of hungary through the austrian border br br of course the bus gets stopped by the russians for a security check the russian officer in charge yul brynner becomes attracted to the english woman deborah kerr and delays the trip of course the russian officer knows the truth about the hungarian scientist posing as a british citizen but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the english woman to come to him of course this all sounds absurd but it is a fun movie to watch despite the romantic flow of dialogue between mr brynner and ms kerr which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting the good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue perhaps some people involved in the hungarian revolt would not appreciate this movie they would consider it a piece of fluff br br this is my favorite yul brynner role he speaks with his own masculine voice and is very attractive especially when he becomes vulnerable this is deborah second time working with yul brynner since they made the king and i in 1956 they make a very attractive couple too bad they never worked again this was the second sexy role ms kerr took since from here to eternity despite the fact that ms kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie she was very beautiful and sensual br br the fine supporting cast was headed by jason robards jr in his first film role some of the international cast were recognizable like for instance robert morley from england however the rest of the actors i have never seen before or since were just great in the movie in the background it was fun to see berger as one of the maids speak a few lines of hungarian a few years later in 1966 she was in a movie cast a giant shadow with yul brynner as his leading lady she is still working today
<START> i love dr who so much i believe that david tennant is the best dr the show has ever had and billie piper the best companion i liked the way the dr and rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose it sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons i will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without rose but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role i rate this show 110 it is fantastic the graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love the world and relationships from this show therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time
<START> this which was shown dubbed in italian at a rome cinema not as bad as it sounds after being presented at the rome film festival is very much an art film and a festival film guaranteed to charm and delight such audiences for its distinctive style droll humor ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others appealing cheery music spot on performances overriding sweetness and humanity but doomed because of its oddity and lack of a compelling story line to leave average audiences wondering what they're watching it for and why anyone admires it how it even got made br br gives us almost a series of dry skits running through them are various themes money a guy at the next table waldemar nicks the wallet of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order a deadbeat son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more loan a shrink worries aloud about his depleted investments while his wife him in bed wearing only a shiny viking helmet br br depression an elementary teacher jessica nilsson breaks down in class because her husband has called her a harpy the rug salesman spouse collapses before clients because he's called her that several men have depressing dreams but hey this is sweden isn't everybody depressed love problems a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist eric wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments music too is obviously a unifying theme besides the dashing guitarist there's a tuba and a drum player who're in a band and also play in marches and funerals every scene has an added lilt from the music which links one sequence with another a raging storm outside the window of many scenes violent rain people out in it thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land this also the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same tempestuous day br br is a master of visual composition and the static middle distance shot and the film has a foggy gray green look engineered by dp gustav that's perfect because it evokes the gloom of a swedish winter but also with the subtle colors of the director's wit which ends every scene with a smile one almost never knew drabness could be so beautiful or perhaps one did sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts within scenes and in the film as a whole there's a kind of stillness that comes out of the visual style the pacing of scenes and the detached humanism of the overall outlook there's something about a fully mastered style that's calming reassuring br br not everything works equally well one may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes which read too much sometimes like the work of a saturday night live writer in need of prozac since some scenes plainly move you or draw a laugh it's obvious that others fall a little flat br br but some scenes are real zingers and one obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream described and then visualized dreams being another important thread in which the girl groupie imagines herself in a wedding dress newly married to her fey guitarist ideal who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a big window the viewpoint switches to outside and the window slides slowly away as if the building the dream newlyweds look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect br br eventually one may feel everything in you the living du is a dream including the recurring scene where the barman is always striking a bronze bell and announcing last order time whereupon all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink br br an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right it limits itself in a dozen ways but there is greatness in it roy is a little master like some medieval of the inner comedies of scandanavian gloom and this is a film unlike any other shown this year as a cannes un certain regard selection this is also the swedish entry for the 2007 best foreign oscar hard to say what bergman would think but worked with him is famous for his elaborately produced tv commercials some of which one can see on youtube bergman called them the best commercials in the world it will be interesting to see if this director whose craft is as subtle as his viewpoint will start working in longer segments some time meanwhile any good film buff really needs to get a look at this br br isn't quite the right word that means delight in the misery of others is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us
<START> an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house regina anna paquin the teenager daughter of mark glen who is sick and has some mental problems and the nurse maria lena olin notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul stephan but her mother does not believe on her reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos fele martÃ­nez the origins of the house and they find that forty years ago the place was the stage of the death of six children reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert giancarlo giannini to protect her brother against the house and her father br br i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna paquin lena olin fele martÃ­nez from thesis and abre los ojos and giancarlo giannini further i like very much spanish cinema in spite of i found a terrible screenplay an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses the intention of the story is good slightly recalling the shinning in some moments but unfortunately it is badly developed never being clear for example the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family mainly the situation between maria and reggie the direction is confused poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story i love anna paquin but her expressionless face never works in this flick lena olin is a caricature of the great actress she is and stephan is too much weak for such important role only fele martÃ­nez has a good performance in his support character i liked the open end of the story my vote is four br br title brazil a the seventh victim
<START> dee snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and overacting kind of ruined it for me the whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously it tries to achieve the dark atmosphere of seven without the good acting the movie highlights the urban industrial rock tattoo body art subculture and expects us to be impressed scared by the size of a guy's nose ring i'm not a expert on movies but the script and acting in this movie are just awful dee snider looks the part of the villain but his acing is downright horrid i recommend not wasting the time on this one unless nothing else is available
<START> what was the aim here i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim poor acting no action and no story i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david beckham's 250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go br br war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama this film pales in comparison to any that i've seen before i must say that iam truly disappointed at this film
<START> once again doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load it has humour you're just making it up as you go along yup but i do it brilliantly action monsters in this case still more kick ass tragedy and scare tactics in short just what the doctor ordered pun intended the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of get on with it so chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh then made you cry and made you go eek br br in terms of character development this is clearly the clincher for noel clarke's mickey and ricky being one of the doctor's companions you know that he will do the right thing and may even suspect the manner that he does it however it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path br br while the rise of the had more of the sinister build up to terror the age of steel is an all out blast like alien compared to aliens both true classics but in different ways can the series keep it up at this level let's hope so
<START> how better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on tv and i don't mean in the show cops here they're actually being presented as protagonists br br i don't see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies whitney houston is a tragic example of the fallen star a star which bobby brown helped pull from the sky bobby brown is nothing but a low life criminal why watch him why does whitney stand by him no matter how despicable he is this couple should be locked up and it's a loathsome shame they are making money and achieving a modicum of fame from watching the septic tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character
<START> words can scarcely describe this movie loaded with ridiculous stereotypes a silly plot and poor music this movie lacks in just about every category br br don't be fooled by the imdb credits this is not a michael dorn movie he's a secondary character in the grand scheme br br also listed in the credit's is an actor named prince which makes me wonder if it's the same artist formerly known as then again i'm not sure this movie is worth watching just for that br br big summary bunch of teams one has kidneys one has 35 000 one has an illegal substance and one has 350 000 add some confusion and as to who needs to meet who revenge on being taken and such and you end up with this mess of a movie br br given a choice i'd pass on this movie
<START> this movie is quite better than the first one et contre cÃ©sar but it is far away from perfection the adaptation of the comic book is good some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book but there's few things that made the movie not as interresting as the animated movie released in 1968 for example the fighting between and this wasn't necessary or even credible either for the little love story of there were also some stuff missing like the songs that are in the animated movie and some other things i am deceived by the movie because they in the stuff i was expecting tho see and they showed things that i did not wanted or needed to see i know that it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same than the comic book or the animated movie but that's what i expected in conclusion even if the movie is good i still prefer the animated movie wich is in my opinion far better
<START> eh i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the herakles myths and because the commercials for it looked serious i was expecting something that was halfway decent br br ten minutes into the film i realized that it was utter crap the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bare and i mean bare minimum parents half brother and labors seemed to be named correctly other than that the rest of the film seemed to be one giant inaccuracy br br i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film the disney version was made for little kids therefore wasn't too serious this movie with all the sex violence and nudity was clearly intended for an older audience yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film
<START> lord have mercy why was this film made why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it the foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind br br the film has an ultra cheap look to it like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach what's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate the result is a film that just don't look right the fight scenes are so dull and edited to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore none of them are engaging or exciting the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it the eastern europe locations a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down or non existent look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an 'action' film what action br br and what is the deal with the title as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign which one does the title refer to br br the dvd is in 1 85 1 anamorphic widescreen and in dolby 5 1 sound neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent the foreigner is not worth one second of your time gotta love that tagline tho 'if they think they can stop him they're dead wrong ' sheesh
