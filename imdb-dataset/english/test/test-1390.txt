<START> i saw this movie only because sophie however her acting abilities it's no enough to this movie almost all cast don't play their character well exception for sophie and frederic the plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places i saw several good french movies but this one i don't like
<START> haa br br i have seen it argued that most american movies are cowboy movies in disguise that hollywood is so in love with it's only truly original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy myth i'm not sure i totally buy that argument but slipstream is evidence in support of the theory it's a cowboy movie with br br actually it goes one better than that it's a spagetti western with substitute the planes with horses make the android a priest and this movie would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen italian spanish semi arty shoot 'em ups with pretensions of the seventies br br the film isn't as bad as i had been lead to believe by some of the reviews i had read here but it certainly wasn't good
<START> this is an extremely competent movie technically the camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well especially the fine acting by daniel auteuil as the marquis i really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film instead i was a bit annoyed by the way the marquis was portrayed as it didn't seem all that honest and seems to be a very view of history in fact in recent years the marquis has undergone a bit of a transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight not the fat sado masochist rapist he really was in a way this is highly reminiscent of the whitewash given in the people versus larry flint where these men are elevated to hero status even if you don't think that the perversions weren't all that bad they included rapes and extreme violence his portrayal in this film as a sexual social worker in this prison seems pretty silly instead of the violent and selfish sade he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality what a nice and kind man in fact now that i think about it this performance reminds me of the man maurice chavalier played in gigi but without the singing a cute older man who loves the ladies i strongly doubt the real life marquis de sade would have recognized this character at all br br the film surprisingly doesn't have a lot of nudity though what it does show is extremely explicit only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama it's very well made and pretty entertaining just not all that truthful the director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the dvd i watched so go ahead and see the film if you'd like understanding it just isn't very good historically during the 18th century sexual were quite accepted in france as they were pretty broad minded so despite what the movie implies it wasn't sex that was the issue it was the violence and rape that was and still is the problem
<START> if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers then this is an excellent movie to watch for informational purposes only i can just hear it now wait just wait a second why don't we follow a cab driver through his entire day are funny and so are the people they meet and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes so the other actors should be cheap harry you take care of production joan you've got materials brian you go round up some actors and we'll all meet back here tomorrow to start filming br br the first 90 of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened at least with no planning whatsoever there is always the element of surprise to be found some of jim carrey's movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices the problem here is that the first 90 is pretty well scripted out and it pretty much sucks paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day we pretty much see what he sees people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people br br i'll admit there were a couple of funny bits here and there a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think for some people he's just a means of getting from here to there but for others his very ordinary words help change the direction of their lives br br the last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie and to a small extent it succeeds it had a bit of that deathbed repentance feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes i wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again as far as the actors go paul dillon is it john cusack gillian anderson and julianne moore are all in this for about 30 seconds each but don't watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed i will give the other people some credit that it's not your ordinary movie they have produced here but it wasn't a very good one either there just wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half it was a decent effort but it failed none the same
<START> i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shill br br the acting of the female lead is actually quite good but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it this is the very definition of dullness br br so far this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes that must mean the director director's girlfriend producer actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10 br br for the rest of you who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story avoid this br br this man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10 br br fda note while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep no medicinal value is implied or offered
<START> first let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting a serial killer the works of edgar allan poe who is one of my writers of all time sounds cool right yeah definitely not probably the worst film i've ever seen ever and that's not an exaggeration i've seen a lot of very very bad movies this one takes the cake and i was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it br br perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure if you have the name of the killer his entire life's history a criminal record and his address where is the first place you should look hmm possibly his house what no that's a preposterous idea anthony how could you suggest something so obvious and level headed rather than going to a bowling alley spoilers end honestly sometimes i can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad or vice versa but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find br br i think my biggest pet peeve was how the police fbi acted br br for example black fbi agent okay endangered female just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while i go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be sound good to you moronic female fbi agent yeah sounds a okay to me go right ahead i'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter black fbi agent excellent that's what i would do honestly if you want to be in law enforcement rent this movie so you can learn how not to act or if you're a human and want to learn the same br br 0 5 10 a half point just for getting a film produced and in stores congrats br br ap3
<START> first snow has an intriguing beginning a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct from this point on the movie plays out like a bloated twilight zone episode i mean nothing but car trips phone calls and paranoia william fichtner gives his usual interesting performance but guy pierce is anything but a sympathetic character disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia the ending is especially weak with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience do yourself a big favor and avoid this one not recommended merk
<START> with the little respect it deserves i would like to state that this movie was horrible the filmmakers had good intentions but the overall quality of the direction and production value was obviously lacking a great deal i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard laugh and then wasting two more hours of their life enduring a truly painful experience i'm surprised i even found this movie on the 1 dvd rack where it was aptly placed i thought maybe it was going to be good and that i might discover some amazing independent film i was wrong i wish i had never seen this movie my 3 year old cousin couldn't make a worse film i'm glad i saw the film because i can finally tell people i've seen the worst movie ever made and be sure of it
<START> there must have been a sale on this storyline back in the 40's an epidemic threatens new york it's always new york and nobody takes it seriously some might say that richard widmark and jack palance did it better in panic in the streets but i disagree br br there is always something about these poverty row productions that really touch a nerve the production values are never that polished and the acting is a little rough around the edges but that is the very reason i think this movie and those like it are effective rough grainy edgy and the cast all 2nd or a list actors past their prime no egos here these folks were happy to get the work whit bissell carl benton reid jim backus arthur space charles and the melodious voice of reed hadley flowing in the background like crude oil by the way i've been in the hospital a couple of times how come my nurses never looked like dorothy malone in these kind of movies they don't bother much with make up and hair but they really managed to turn evelyn keyes into a hag or maybe they just skipped the make up and hair altogether anyway it was pretty effective she plays a lovesick jewel smuggler who picks up a case of small pox in cuba while smuggling jewels back for ultra villain charles who is boffing her sister in the meantime you got the customs agents looking for her because of the jewels and the health department looking for her because she's about to de populate new york no 4th amendment rights here everybody gets hassled br br you gotta have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this i have a brother who movies to death if they don't hold up to his orson standards he bombs them they must have the directorial excellence of a david lean movie the score of wolfgang von the sound and art of douglas shearer and cedric gibbons respectively this ain't it br br but i have the right attitude and if you do as well you'll love this movie
<START> essentially a undistinguished b movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era's major talents fritz lang even with the stellar names of lang walter pidgeon joan bennett and george sanders be prepared for a ludicrous storyline bad acting patently phony sets and miscasting for transparency sake i have to admit i am an ardent non admirer of walter pidgeon who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream factory of mgm and somehow worked in secondary roles supporting greer garson and others he is wildly miscast acting in a chipper '30s ray milland madcap comedy tone in a role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding joan bennett's cockney accent is excessive but her lacquered hair perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street wise cockney slum girl george sanders is incapable of bad acting but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense thriller surrounded by light hearted comedic interplay hitchcock totally reversed the ratio using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense there is a reason this film is unknown it didn't serve or propel anybody's career or reputation and is forgotten because it's a surprisingly bad film from such a group
<START> i got this movie from ebay mainly because i'm gay and i love til schweiger however it's one of those movies that when you watch it a second time you never say to yourself hmm i forgot about this boring part i'll go make popcorn it doesn't have that part it's a very fluid and constantly interesting film and yes til schweiger is worth it if nothing else but it's a great movie even for straight guys
<START> this is an excellent movie had no role model's to base her actions on yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment i like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up it added to the horror of the story the triumph
<START> being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage i have stumbled across this little treasure action romance crooked cops violence its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right i was in love immediately then a funny thing happened about the second time around i became addicted i thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind of movie br br rudy ray moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie he didn't have the money to make it look good but he did it anyway that's very commendable it also shows he was making the movie for his self i don't know how many of you have heard rudy ray's music but if you haven't he has a whole slew of albums reaching into the fifties
<START> an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do br br predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending
<START> 1 2 elisha cuthbert chad michael murray brian van holt paris hilton and jon abrahams directed by serra br br yet another classic horror film remade with headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths based on the 1953 vincent price film house of wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like tobe hooper's 1974 classic texas chainsaw massacre later remade despite creativity and so so acting the movie was still just a gore picture director serra showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching my final rating 7 10
