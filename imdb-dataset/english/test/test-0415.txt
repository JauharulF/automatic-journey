<START> according to lucien in his histoire de la musique robert lafont 1973 page beethoven's character was not very compatible with women he had quite a number of platonic passions with female members of the aristocracy to whom he dedicated some but musicians even composers did not qualify for husbands of fine ladies haydn was a servant of prinz von mozart died from drink or poison and was according to a frequent customer of street prostitutes in vienna a british biographer newman says that beethoven contracted syphilis before he was 40 that he became deaf because of that is possible but not certain br br the ninth symphony was premiered on may 7 1824 in the in vienna along with the consecration of the house overture and the first three parts of the this was the composer's first on stage appearance in twelve years the hall was packed although the performance was directed by michael the theater's beethoven shared the stage with him quiet br br so what remains of this female fantasy ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good but too linear based on the painting by date i have it in front of me it shows a man that despises perhaps hates the world with good reason
<START> crazy six is torture it must be albert worst film even blast and ticker are better i canÂ´t believe how boring this film is how this even got greenlighted i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was this isnÂ´t good bad movie it is simply bad bad bad bad bad movie br br 1 out of 10 Â½ out of
<START> back in the dark days of 1990 the hoped for heir to the spielberg throne after the failure of supposed whiz kid phil was mistakenly believed to be pretentious spielberg wannabe david mickey evans evans managed to fleece the studios for over a million dollars suckering baby boomer executives into believing his screenplay a combination of nostalgic 1960s references and a disturbing drama about child abuse somehow equaled good storytelling and a decent film br br as rod stewart once sang look how wrong you can be br br but the artsy fartsy e t inspired script convinced enough people he was the next chosen one the new spielberg and so a deal was struck to not only buy the script for more money than 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lifetime but for evans to direct the film as well even though he'd had never directed anything in his life br br hey how hard can it be to be another film making genius after all br br two weeks into the shoot columbia found out his dailies were called totally unusable by the studio or at least those level headed enough to not to have fallen under the e n c emperor's new clothes spell all his footage was scrapped and recycled into guitar pics br br so what's a studio to do after sinking 10 or 20 million dollars into something they still believed represented the resurrection of steven spielberg hire spielberg himself to save the day columbia probably tried that br br enter old pro richard donner hey he may not be a cinematic genius but he gets the job done superman wasn't too bad after all and the first lethal weapon was pretty good br br so donner steps in and grabs the directorial reins fortunately he manages to convince columbia that the worst of the film's insipid fantasy sequences which would have played out like a ten year old's acid trip have to go unfortunately he leaves in the crying buffalo ooh how poetic and the ridiculous pseudo spielberg fantasy ending complete with clueless mom perfectly content for the rest of her life to get postcards from her missing son as he circles the globe in his red wagon right br br but donner did manage to get a decent performance out of elijah wood and lorraine bracco as the idiot mom wasn't bad either maybe donner should be reevaluated maybe he's not such a phony hollywood hack as everyone has always believed br br the only reason i'm giving this over baked misfire a 2 rating is that someone was smart enough to cast the great john heard but in the wrong part of course the kids do okay though tom hanks' horrible overly explanatory narration nearly destroys every scene it intrudes upon br br one might think that after the david mickey and phil and troy of the world the studios might finally wise up one might hope that these hype driven film making debacles might prevent the emperor's new clothes syndrome from ever its ugly head again br br doubtful
<START> very strange but meant to be this director is his own man even through there are strains if polanski bergman and kafka at least in the episode no 6 the peeping tom one what made it all so strange and reminiscent of the above three artists was that it went all over the place you never knew where it was headed and could have ended anyplace and finally when it did end could have kept going the ending is hardly a finality nobody could tell you what these two characters would be doing in even the next frame one other thing should be said about the director no wonder kubrick found him fascinating there is a lot of eyes wide shut in this episode somehow in the direct approach to character the realistic fantasy elements of both a kubrick placement of the camera without any of the stark effects much more washed out and hurried not as over that said back to the beginning still this guy has his own things to say and says them well yet for some reason there is not a single scene i ever want to see again but definitely did not feel ripped off in the least watching it one time around but i did keep getting the feeling of three or four other directors ghosts moving through the parade blurring everything the caveat being that it was only episode six the other nine might give me entirely different takes but since this episode revolved around peeping looking the absolute domain of film i will say this he took none of the usual routes definitely went his own way while carrying the baggage of a lot of good directors behind him
<START> creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight rope it either works or it does not grandma's boy is one of those movies that does not work it may have a few very funny parts but for the majority it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films sans sandler himself he's just a producer br br alex allen covert is a game tester he's 35 and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid filled workplace he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills as it turns out his roommate had just been spending the rent money on hookers and not paying the landlord desperate he moves in with his grandmother lilly doris roberts of everybody loves raymond and her two roommates br br that's the basic plot of the film thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha linda unrecognizable from her days as velma in scooby doo trying to get the to complete a new game as fast as they can a robot like game creating prodigy j p joel moore who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix and of course all sorts of sex and drug related jokes that's it br br the problem with the film besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film is that it just is not funny it is totally mind numbingly boring and only sparingly funny nothing really happens at all no emotion no real sense of direction and a whole ton of intense swearing you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say but otherwise sit in complete boredom wishing you had not even bothered with the film how this film was greenlit and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me br br there's just no entertainment value to come from it none of the actors are actually putting in good performances they are just acting like idiots for the camera and hoping for the best stoner comedy has been done before multiple times and on occasion actually works harold and kumar go to white castle and dazed and confused come to mind here it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either br br other than a few funny one liners this movie should just be out right missed altogether it's not very funny the entire plot is silly it's boring and it just makes for one horrendous film avoid it like the plague br br 1 5 10
<START> what should have been a dramatic tale of life on the river murray turns out to be a silly soppy romance about an english refugee sigrid thornton with aussie accent who falls for the larrikin first mate john waters of a paddle steamer br br the first half of this four and a half hour mini series shows some promise but it soon falls flat as it becomes predictable and thin some real verve and spark was needed in the plot to give the movie some life gus mercurio's early exit didn't help as his character seemed to me to be the only interesting one br br perhaps the longer t v version has more depth because this video translation certainly lacked it br br sunday june 27 1993 video
<START> i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad even worse than ticker that movie was bad it was kind of like they popped it out in a week looked to be very low budget only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor everything it just blew
<START> this is a wonderful movie i've only seen it twice and i've been looking for it again for ever i'd buy it if i could find it while it's sad it shows three things how much a man can love a woman how hard some people want something and how hard people work to overcome their limitations
<START> rififi jules dassin france 1955 br br to me it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood remake of jules dassin's 1955 classic rififi planned for release in 2007 al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead taking on the role of tony le risky business how they're gonna pull this off br br ironically dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece aptly called by some the of all caper and heist movies in my opinion it remains a one of a kind classic beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film whatever one's opinion of the film br br in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised nevertheless this french noir classic shouldn't be forgotten go see it before the remake is out there in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two br br camera obscura 9 10
<START> in brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of spacey assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in buddhism and hinduism it can be said that is the eye of the storm the world is in disarray and is and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees but sees truth he sees the minute and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly br br the film is particularly detailed therefore i would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how nuances listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies br br 9 of out 10 rating superb with nominal room for improvement
<START> deep blood its one of those movies you here about and you say not another italian jaws ripoff well deep blood is far from that it is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well in jaws and all the other shark films we all have seen or herd about they all use fake made sharks well in joe d'amato's film he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scenes this is one of the many reasons i like deep blood so much is because it didn't use stock footage br br in deep blood an ancient indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark in joe d'amato's shark classic deep blood br br it seems that a native american elder once warned a group of youngsters about this great evil in the sea and years later the friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coastline now it's up to the remaining few to make sure that this monster is killed even if it means heading out to sea to do it br br joe d'amato directed and produced this film under his company the filmirage released in 1989 and was later used in bruno mattei's cruel jaws jaws 5 along with many other shark films joe d'amato's shark entry is a great film and any joe d'amato fan of shark movie watcher should give it a try
<START> i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions and i even liked the wade quinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends a la star wars traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years rather than a tired band of knit pickers
<START> spoilers well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of america back in the 1950's back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children especially teen agers needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family they also needed love and attention to their growing up problems which is what 16 year old hal james macarthur never got from his successful movie producer dad mr tom james daly br br never really connecting with his dad hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom helen kim hunter as well as from society after his dad put hal down about him wanting to borrow his car a late model luxury sedan he and his friend jerry jeffery silver drive in hal's beat up and barley operational 1930's jalopy to the local to catch the latest western flick br br feeling like striking out at the world hal acts like a real first class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple eddie ryder jean corbett sitting in front of him and jerry trying to watch the movie this leads hal as well as his friend jerry to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager mr whit bissell it turned out that at least hal was willing to leave the theater without even getting his money back but when tries to grab him hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser br br hal now in real hot water he's charged with assault and battery put's on his james dean act at the local police station making like he's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he's done almost knocked mr teeth out it's when sgt shipley james tells hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done br br the rest of the film has hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him begging his father to understand that what he did in belting mr was in self defense hal's father acts as if he's been there at the theater and saw the whole incident with his son hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation br br not excusing what hal did in laying out mr he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both mr and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration in the fact that he provoked hal and mr in not even bothering to hear him out feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone but his mom to really turn too hal slowly loses it only to later have both sgt shipley and mr agree to drop the assault charge you would think that by now hal's has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson more then a stretch behind bars that hal's so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored being there when his son needed him most and in that mr failed with flying colors br br things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after mr gets belted ending up with a butte of a shiner again by hal who going back to theater tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that hal was only defending himself when he first not the second time around clobbered him in the end hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems but most of all hal's father mr learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail keeper and a sugar daddy like the song says all you need s love to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son hal that mr until the very end of the movie lacked the most off
<START> waste of this nasty little film is one to avoid its like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap why the writer wrote this is obvious he has no soul and did it to try and me some money the twists were obvious when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and didn't etc only good thing about it is i've discovered 1 new actress worth watching peyton list don't watch shuttle though there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world spend your time more wisely watch good films do some exercise cook a nice meal anything but waste your time on rubbish like this
<START> i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are exchanged among various rental outlets 'the man who down hmm never heard about it the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to ski down everest and actually did it sounds interesting i rented it as expected it was documentary style the first part can be summarized so i always wanted to ski down mount everest this is followed by some footage of preparation for the event lots of preparation footage ok i suppose it takes a lot of preparation then we are treated to a protracted piece on the skier philosophy on life etc more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the skiing fits in to this show more preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain more philosophy is shown at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin' thing lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow speed on the steep slope finally he straps on the skis and gets ready to go br br he's off he skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot out from under him he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and that's that end of story what the heck was that br br ok i can buy that he always wanted to ski down everest made extensive preparations and actually tried it with camera crew in tow it didn't work and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself so what egregious hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it skiing down everest perhaps the title the man who's feet shot out from under him and he slid on his ass down everest was just too long for the tape box
