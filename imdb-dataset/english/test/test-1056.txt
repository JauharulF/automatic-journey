<START> this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it this was a mistake i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck terrible horrible but somehow you just can't look away i guess br br this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean one by one they are all murdered one drinks cleaning fluid one gets blown up on a one goes over a cliff so these are not accidents but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should wrap the shoot and go home not just in respect for the dead but perhaps out of fear for their own lives no they just continue with their shoot because that is what's most important forget about the dead models we have a magazine to produce br br one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner played by lee majors rex is his name he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says well i can't say this won't be good for sales hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha so absurd another subplot is when it's revealed that rex is one of the models baby only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort she didn't but always resented him for even suggesting this br br they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and looks creepy br br at the very end sorry to spoil but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now one of the women was found face down dead in the pool this was the last straw vanessa angel forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun they struggle the gun fires and now she's dead too while she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault he gets him to sign over the magazine to him once he does voila all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rex br br oy what a ridiculous movie as someone else said if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better
<START> oz is one of the most mind blowing and addictive tv experiences ever br br having caught pieces of this on sbs i was at first skeptical however having finished now the 4th season i sadly know that that this brilliant show is approaching its end 6 seasons and yet i still can't get enough of oz br br want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit oz fits the bill hands down br br this isn't kid's stuff folks its violent brutal and not pretty why its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison br br tom fontana's oz is brilliant in all the right departments the actors the writing and directing br br hbo's oz site is also highly recommended for newcomers for info about this series this was the first one hour show produced by hbo and it proves what a master work it is and that others would follow br br thank you hbo
<START> this film is an eery but interesting film i will tell you why it is eery later in this review br br the film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound no it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film no it may not contain great action scenes but it is still a wonderful film to me it sparked a whole knew revolution if you will of sound movies this can be a little eery to watch knowing that everyone in that film are now dead i can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the earth visible and that the sound is and broken br br i recommend this video for everyone to watch this created movies as we know it today
<START> an ex informant of the east germany finishes in mexico like spy of a student group in 1971 in where she falls in love with one of the activists this is the first co production of mexico with germany and although it is a good picture of the ideals that marked and continue marking at least to the youth as much finishes being something insipid since to the internal dilemmas that it faces dark brown like the passion by his ideals that adela feels as soon as they glimpse in the case of him i want to suppose by the barrier of the language and in the case of her by its lack of experience reason why in the end a concrete identification with any of them does not exist which causes that what could have been films that even served as document like red dawn finished being one more a film although i want to clarify that in the room many of the assistants were excited in the conversation with the director which says to me that no longer they are so young or my ideals have changed
<START> significant spoilers br br this is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick twisted director jennifer chambers lynch who also wrote it i don't even know why i gave this movie a rating of 2 it is not the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind br br i do know that i will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch she is a sick twisted foul mouthed foul thinking deviant she looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent 20 years doing hard time you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of surveillance the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this movie br br i'm not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any film the level of implied sado violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description i was seeking this is a snuff film br br be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this director writer is truly a sick person i can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that i will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind br br when i saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killers br br as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long term psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing film br br while the little girl stephanie ryan truly stole the show i can't believe that her real life parents would have tolerated this sick foul mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter br br this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility br br as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character i'm stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see br br other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer director who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert i'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd br br this writer director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the director writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family br br fortunately jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles i don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out i'd recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and i'm not too sure her dad's films would be any better br br do yourself a favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch
<START> this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life from the opening 10 minutes i was ready to leave the cliches there slapping you in the face and the plot was not only predictably stupid but full of more holes than swiss cheese i am considering suing for that lost 2 hours and 6 25 along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film the t rex's must be flipping in their graves so to speak
<START> this movie is allegedly a comedy so where did all the laughs go did the forget to put them in on the version i watched as a football movie it is mildly entertaining i guess just a stick in the mud with no discernible sense of humour or maybe this movie just isn't funny it is also annoying with that way over the top you're a winner musical score and the odd thing is the team sucked through most of the season only winning the last two games and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the playoffs so what is the point are they celebrating mediocrity i don't see it if anybody knows please let me know anyway this movie isn't great or even very good i'm giving it a low 3
<START> one of my favorite hartley movies as if there could be a bad one although this may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect nonetheless it still maintains that hartley slant to which we've all become accustomed br br first picture jesus and satan discussing their ideas opinions hopes and regrets about the impending end of civilization now imagine the entire conversation taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar and as an added conversational not to mention visual distraction let's toss in pj harvey as the sultry companion aka to mr then just for grins in the background an ever present salvation army band played by yo la to serve as an added diversion the road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure br br quite possibly more questions than answers but therein lies the fun and mr donovan is subdued brilliance as always
<START> there are many many older movies that deserve to be transferred to the dvd format this is surely one of them an anthony quinn triumph scores of movies portray the victims of nazi atrocities before and during the war but i don't think any of them have delved into the psyche of the victim and predator as well as this this one has anthony quinn was truly a man for all seasons he had the ability to portray the humblest of creatures devoid of any human to a creature of extreme and pull it off as believable to the audiences who watched with no afterthought of what they had just witnessed truly one of our greatest artists he is missed
<START> ben marshall a teen ager from a religious background is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother laura she suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household in fact the family has taken a widower to board with them robert marshall the father is a pastor at the local church he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church br br the job ben applies is with an older actress walton who wants him to do things for her around the house dame as she calls herself is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great in fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it who is a compulsive liar tells ben she's dying only to forget it conveniently later on when she comes clean to the boy br br ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer he has been taking driving lessons asks him to take a camping trip which he does against his better judgment he knows that it will provoke his mother's fury not content with that decides to go on to edinburgh where she has been invited to read at an arts festival it is this trip that solidifies their bond ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic br br when ben gets back everything crumbles at home his mother who has been having an affair with a decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with ben and relationship survives the test of time he also begins to see his own father in a different light br br jeremy brock the writer of driving lessons and other memorable english films takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy the mixture of show business and religion loyalty and friendship are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies we have seen the similar situation before as in billy elliott where julie walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man we had read the film was based on mr brock's own experience while working dame peggy ashcroft when he was young br br julie walters who plays walton is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie she always delivers ms walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake dame laura linney a luminous player herself doesn't quite get our sympathy with her icy mother rupert famous for his harry potter's movies plays ben the young man who sees in a kind soul nicholas farrell is the betrayed father michelle duncan has a small role in which she shines

<START> i saw this movie back in 1954 on a double bill with valley of the kings these movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in egyptology in 1975 i visited egypt seen today the egyptian suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches but it's a glorious movie to look at the sort of thing hollywood alas just doesn't do anymore and it has a great story not just the usual boy meets girl or vengeance is mine affair too bad 20th won't re issue restored prints of this to be seen on the big screen
<START> if the following sounds tempting then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie post haste br br 1 awful 60's hairstyles from pathetic perms to dodgy br br 2 the worst child actor in the world ever who does nothing but cry and say daddy in the most annoying voice imaginable br br 3 lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film at all br br 4 stereotypical indians who use and talk oh and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire br br 5 hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set br br 6 the exterior shots of 5 which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light br br 7 terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first star trek series look cutting edge by comparison special mention the little boy's blond hair glowing oh dear br br 8 laughable editing and continuity where background items move between scenes the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc br br 9 not got enough money to hire a professional dancer get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot no one will notice the difference er br br 10 a climax involving quicksand snakes more stuff from the archives and a ton of fake blood don't forget to put in a stupid sounding song either br br the more sensible among you however will wait for it's inevitable appearance on mst3k when this classic tv show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable not to mention unworkable so don't even try it 0 10
<START> alfred hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his best regarded films made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures suspicion and shadow of a doubt it's generally regarded as a lesser effort i agree that the later film is groundbreaking drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players bob cummings and priscilla lane br br in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america literally as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused cummings is very youthful here and quite engaging his but not immaturity perfectly suits the character he is portraying and seems appropriate as the director though middle aged was in the process of reinventing himself and an older more established star might have thrown things off priscilla lane's spunky heroine which not a typical type for the director was very much a common type in american films at the time and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time i cannot imagine older more solid types cooper and stanwyck for instance doing any better as they would have between them carried well too much baggage br br as is the norm in hitchcock's films nothing is as it appears where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early though cummings is an accused arsonist we know that he is innocent the villains become apparent fairly soon and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies what pleasures there are are incidental and here the master does not disappoint there is an interesting tod interlude with some circus freaks who help cummings elude capture in another scene reminiscent of james whale's bride of frankenstein cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man who as it turns out is lane's uncle was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade whatever the case these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety which when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man still learning his craft br br the film's later scenes in new york are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the picture gradually becomes more as it moves along in the end i find it a satisfying work and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor neither does the movie have one it is deliberately lightweight and i suspect semi experimental an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off in an american setting the sort of story he had done so well in england he succeeded admirably the next logical step shadow of a doubt a film in which the main character travels east to west and with a wholly different set of values and plans br br
<START> informs us that 14 year olds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious to those who don't know that the film performs a public service otherwise it's a lot of flashy with little or no reason for being i will allow that the camera work is sometimes striking but also that it can be madly self indulgent at other times the actors occupy screen space and screen time but do not compute as compelling human beings i suppose the e mail that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker but i simply couldn't tell enough differences to do so and really didn't care anyway
