<START> ok a warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian be careful about who you see this film with ie do not take kids to see this film i'll explain why br br 1 the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance i assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying 2 the film itself is really very very disturbing i have some problems first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a 'horror film' but it is a very disturbing film and involves a child and his parents and a small town br br ok it boils down to this the film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child is has a bizarre quality to it and its only because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable as a parent myself i feel strongly enough to want to tell people because i read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres br br i hope im not offending the film makers by saying this but i think its my right because its getting a release and has an m rating only because its not violent or sexual just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself
<START> proud as i am of being a dutchman i'm truly shocked by flicks like these why why this cheap acting why this storyline that just sucks why a dozen sequels why o why they add a lot of hot dutch chicks in an effort of saving this movie from redemption and guess what all the underaged in holland go and see it i was forced to watch it at a party all the girls were going crazy when entered the screen all the guys took a another beer and grumbled but the thing that really bothers me is the fact that this kind of flicks are the only sort of movies dutch filmmakers can produce apart from van god los and lek this doesn't prove our superiority to other countries it doesn't add anything to our imagination it just f ks up the brains of little 13 year old girls johan i hope you will burn forever
<START> this is a good plot concept so why o why is it such a poor film the acting is terrible and every shock is signposted so far in advance that it is almost laughable by the time it reaches you spend your time and money elsewhere this is not worth watching
<START> i loved it others have revealed spoilers but i won't it was an unusual premise actually sort of weird but i went along with it completely camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly maybe that's why some people hated it but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly without being maudlin or ridiculous i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco but married him anyway i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job he has nothing to be ashamed of there have been movies with with similar setups e g ghost i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated and hope it becomes more recognized by the public i thought all of the actors played their parts very well and hope more people get to see the movie i highly recommend it i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available i definitely plan to buy it
<START> the good the acting were great especially terrence howard and thandie newton terrence howard should have been nominated for best supporting actor instead of matt dillon br br the bad i'm a visible minority non white and i have experienced some form of racism in my life but despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter i would definitely not say that this movie is the best of the year in fact it's far from it i have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible perspective some of my problems with this movie are br br 1 poor character development or none at all just because we saw extremes in a character for example matt dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father that does not mean in any way that the character is well developed yes i admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie it is quite difficult for every character to be well developed but that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that br br 2 the dialogue seems really contrived to the point that i'm really surprised this movie won for best original screenplay they should show this movie in a screenplay writing class not because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what not to do i just felt like i've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is i get it br br 3 the plot seems so coincidental it is laughable what are the chances of a black car robber running over an asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital only to find out that the several asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all or what about that scene where a prejudiced upper class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air if it was that simple why don't we throw every racist in america down the stairs so they will have a change of heart br br 4 i think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism as someone who has experienced racism in my life the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face i've been refused to enter a supermarket because i'm not white did the store owner said because i was not white no he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside did he yell racial slurs no racism in america is more hidden some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs if a chinese woman rear ended me i won't be saying blake blake learn some english bitch on the other hand if i was a chinese woman and i accidentally rear ended a mexican woman i won't say mexicans are bad drivers in front of her face that's not how things work instead i would give out my insurance info say sorry and go home and tell my fellow chinese friends and family that mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs that is the real racism it's hidden and not in your face br br anyway crash is not original unlike what some people may say the interlocking and interweaving story lines plots and characters have been done before magnolia is a movie that does this much better than crash did and yet it was never nominated for best picture at the oscars it had a stellar cast julianne moore william h macy phillip seymour hoffman who won best actor recently tom cruise etc it really boggles my mind how crash was even nominated for best picture
<START> you belong to me 1941 is a example of the comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar wwii some of these films maintained their status others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops like bringing up baby 1938 or mr mrs smith 1941 then there is this one which value just keeps sinking br br why can be rooted in the screenplay story it strains credibility from the get go betraying a superior cast barbara stanwyck is married to millionaire henry fonda who is insanely jealous he would be content to sit back with his million and love her she wishes to maintain her profession as a doctor she wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society this conflict is supposed to amuse us it cannot be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast br br the faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of dalton henry fondas' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him barbara stanwyck just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a useful idiot then being on the job columbia obviously did not get their moneys worth from him maybe robert should taken over
<START> ugh what an embarrassing episode last night it was either a failed script for abc afterschool special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic pc anti gun from 1974 the gun in fact hubby were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being melted down like in the movie br br no i'm not some nra shill it's just that when the producer of an intelligent nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2 by 4 geez br br ok the sociology lesson is over the message has been delivered the important episode has been aired now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence
<START> i used to love the muppets the muppet movie the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan were good family movies cleverly written and fun to watch i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood sleaze bandwagon but here it is scooter as a caged rave dancer pepe making lewd and suggestive comments every five minutes this is not your father's muppets it's not jim henson's muppets anymore either br br this it's a wonderful life themed movie has its moments but not enough to save it i cringed while watching this with my children i still have hope for their next movie but this one was certainly a disappointment
<START> yes i felt like i had been gutted after first seeing it but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation i won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film but there is one new area i want to touch on spoilers why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance i must disagree watch the scene again huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage the student is quite an expressive girl crying vocalizing her fears just the opposite of huppert's character there is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother the mother visibly upset states we gave up everything so she could study piano and huppert immediately snaps you mean she gave up everything don't you br br so it was my thought that huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny she didn't want the girl to end up like her repressed hardened condemned to a life of recitals gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago before things grew bad maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age is she ruining the student's life or simply freeing her br br for me that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film brilliant
<START> prince of central park 2000 is so utterly bad it was a pure waste of my time and i can't believe i actually watched the whole thing please do not watch this movie if it's the last thing you do
<START> come on fantastic drama on screen are you joking folks i wouldn't put horrible molly gross to play even in school play where did these people learn acting borrowing some papers from their neighbors actor terrible plot awful acting heh why do you take us for an imbeciles what can i say more i understand this is an tv production and the acting is not supposed to be the one from citizen kane but nevertheless they should try it harder in order to earn their money and apart from that what can be said in 10 lines for a simple movie like this u wanna article in the morning paper to say what worse film in the decade ok you want it you got it
<START> burt reynolds' riposte to clint eastwood encroaching on his redneck comedy turf with his orangutan comedies was to make his own dirty harry in chicago style thriller sharky's machine originally intended for john boorman but in the end directed by the star himself it's an out and out commercial package with reynolds a narc who gets busted down to the vice squad literally they're in the basement who sets out to nail a mysterious crime lord who is backing earl holliman as the next governor you can guess the rest but while reynolds tends to lose sight of the story at times he has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance out of rachel ward as the high class hooker he falls for the romantic subplot is unusually well developed there are a couple of good action scenes and some nice touches such as having vittorio lookalike villain a mirror image of the hero or reynolds and a killer both staking out a witness from adjacent apartments in the same building one of the star's better films from his glory days it's no classic but it makes for a more than efficient saturday night special
<START> i would bet a month's salary the magnificent seven returns msr was made for tv other reviewers attest that msr was a theatrical movie and i'll take their word for it the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv and after a change of studio heart it was released theatrically instead every actor is primarily a tv actor mariette hartley michael waite stephanie powers tv performers all lee van cleef split his time between tv and theater screens stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 real movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career proof positive this was shot for tv minor players are veteran small screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of gunsmoke wild wild west streets of san francisco and so on br br the ho hum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets often seen in old episodic tv and the editing betrays the one or two takes of tv with limited camera movements positioning cutting and lighting the sound track exclusive of the original themes are straight from seventies television yep i'd bet money it was shot for tv br br that's an important point in evaluating msr initially i watched msr on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release in comparison to the original magnificent seven it's a joke a cartoon an amateurish attempt at movie making acting lighting writing settings action cinematography music the themes editing pacing on and on all pale in comparison to the classic magnificent seven which is close to the perfect 60's western and one of the great action movies of all time br br however viewed as an early 70's made for tv movie as i suspect the film is actually better than average those unfortunate enough to live through the 70's as an adult know what i'm talking about msr would have competed against alias smith and jones and similarly bland network shows during the seventies gunsmoke was a quality show concentrating on character development rather than action gun play to two shootouts a week the first shooting usually a murder sets the hour's plot into motion the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star his nemesis or otherwise resolving the conflict with marshal matt dillon msr has more action than a whole season of gunsmoke in this light in this frame of reference msr is passable entertainment a cut above the tv fare from that decade
<START> this film was very different form the previous films and i had to wonder where is ralph macchio he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as old friend who teaches julie what he already knows then can come along and add some more macchio could've been the love interest for julie in this film never mind br br on a serious level i enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do karate and her feelings are very different to what daniel's were julie is much more wild than daniel was and needs taming something which finds very challenging she's quite a troubled girl and a rude obnoxious brat br br it was very satisfying to watch the transformation in julie as she warms to and gets to understand more about karate and her life in general we can all learn a thing or two from witticisms
<START> enjoyed http ow ly my wife didn't so i watched it in bits over a few days br br reviewers mainly confused most agree it's allegorical but not of what br br that most people don't wish to escape and it's essentially forbidden goes with most of those options br br so presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation prejudice fear onto it br br so i'd say it's about an a life a live desaturated of colour literally in the film figuratively in the interpretation
