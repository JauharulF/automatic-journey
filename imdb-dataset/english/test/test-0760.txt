<START> to this day there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the chipmunk adventure nor has any movie brought me more happiness this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest funniest most exciting film ever i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop think pat on helium only catchier br br controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the song gettin' lucky with you which to me seemed much more innocent at the time however looking at it as a rational adult i can totally understand the concern you've got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming getting lucky is what it's all about the were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie br br but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing the otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie especially if you were a child of the eighties early nineties like me
<START> i have some great memories watching robin of sherwood on tv as a kid but i think i only saw michael episodes by some reason and recently my brother bought the new released dvd boxes of the complete series it was great to see it again and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv series the cast is great and the locations mixed with music adds this very special feeling i personally think that is the best of the two robins but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with ray winstone nicolas grace and robert is terrific in their roles as will scarlet the sheriff of nottingham and guy of itÂ´s a pity that a fourth season never got made and iÂ´ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series robert of huntingdon connery could finally have married marion judi or maybe the hunter could resurrect robin of and he could take his revenge against the sheriff as have been mentioned before if the producers of robin hood the prince of thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from robin of sherwood and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series as ray winstone puts it in the dvd it would have been great to see them as old men just like in sean robin and marian who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again
<START> note this should probably be read only after watching the film br br it is very rare to find a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser deep water does just this making it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time it does not provide us with a hero to look up to but rather an anti hero who forces us to look into ourselves br br the film is about a group of men who attempt to sail around the globe singlehandedly and without stopping only one makes it several die one decides not to return home each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to merit entire films for themselves yet the most interesting is donald or rather the way that he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers br br by any standards this man should be considered a despicable character yet why is he depicted so heroically why are we so sympathetic to him from the beginning he made all of the wrong choices he risked his family financially to get the boat he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity he ignored all of the warnings despite his lack of experience he chose to lie instead of admitting defeat these choices snowball until the inevitable and final one suicide all for what a place in history a feeling of accomplishment perhaps what is important to consider is whether this mans situation was inevitable br br each individual must ask himself if his natural human drive for fame and accomplishment would bring him to such recklessness and i believe that examining your own reaction to story will offer at least some answer to that question
<START> this film has an amazing cast mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret o'brien lionel barrymore edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home while they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name sort of like carnegie but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to o'brien and since she's an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great br br there also is a goofy subplot involving fairies led by the wonderful character actor henry davenport and since o'brien is irish as evidenced by her outrageous accent she and the little people make up much of the plot frankly i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely instead the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old men's hearts this would have worked but the little people sheesh overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe i noticed a lot of people liked this film i guess i'm just an old grouch i found the film horrible difficult to watch
<START> yep those of my generation who grew up watching those old cartoons were spoiled the 80's joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television well written stories well developed characters granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line fast forward almost twenty years later and enter valor vs venom the animation was average at most the movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like the movie felt more like a small soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force then we have character development or lack there of dusty likes to be all dusty slice and dice like to do things together what did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of jar jar binks as for the story i like a bit of sci fi but that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the joe universe mega monsters or zombies anyone but i give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes i'm not a huge fan of se and ss but i did like the fight scenes between the two if you can appreciate for what it is you will enjoy it i admit to not being able to appreciate as i should again everything joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of gi joe if you can appreciate for what it is you will enjoy it
<START> it's also the best book i've ever read karl urban and steve are great together it had drama adventure and sweetness and sadness i laughed i cried it's hard not to laugh when gus is talking i wish gus would have smacked clara like he did inez clara just lead gus on all those years with no intentions of ever marrying him she just liked playing with him it was sad that he spent his whole life pining for her it would have been nice if woodrow had married maggie but she would have just died on him anyway woodrow was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up it was obvious that he loved maggie after the raid on austin when the rangers got back and he ran to hold her val kilmer is excellent at playing odd characters i loved his portrayal of captian inish skull i loved the whole lonesome dove saga comanche moon is the best of the bunch
<START> as a massive fan of dm it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times however i watch it purely for the concert footage the rest of the film is um pretty dreadful sad to say br br famed rock music film director da followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour which promoted the superb album of the same name the title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the pasadena bowl but is also a reference to the movie being a on the band and how it ticks ie mode 101 amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of dm fans who've won a competition to meet the band go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig br br now as i said above the concert footage is great mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an band back in the late 80s though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece violator there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg behind the wheel the majestic never let me down again everything counts just can't get enough from the vince clarke years shake the disease and many more br br when mode are onstage they are brilliant when they are not they're well very boring nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration as an example the probable highlight of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes not exactly thrilling stuff i know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots but these guys make the mormon choir look like br br the only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band's lead singer dave comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on there's one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage truly embarrassing the man clearly had issues back then which thankfully have been resolved songwriter martin gore and keyboardist andy fletcher are presented as very articulate clearly massively talented but also utterly colourless men while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb br br and as for the tour' thread well it's unwatchable dross let's not kid ourselves maybe it's just because it's all so very late 80s but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation they are to a person singularly shallow and vapid people whose antics are banal when they aren't hide your face cringeworthy let me reiterate nothing happens in the footage that isn't onstage that is of any interest nothing endless scenes of kids spraying their hair arguing pointlessly changing their clothes getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing if cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in '88 89 the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to and is at times infectiously joyous but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them then i'd hate to see the outtakes br br but the music is all that matters and in this regard 101 excels the pasadena concert one of their all time best gigs makes the film worth seeing the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage a good 80 of the performance and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans the audio commentary by the band minus wilder who left mode in the mid 90s on the first disc is also oddly far more interesting than the film itself br br as a document of the boys from during their idol period mode 101 is invaluable but if you're looking for excitement you're better off getting the accompanying double live album now available in super audio cd format
<START> made it through the first half an hour and deserved a medal for getting that far lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time what sounded like a good idea for a movie was badly executed
<START> for me a ten star film is one that never dies in my memory and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time this could be a technically flawed movie the pleasure has nothing to do with spit and polish my personal top ten is idiosyncratic to say the least john carpenter's the thing is one of very few films to fit this criterion br br i've been a science fiction fan since i was a child in the sixties and i read the john w campbell short story on which the film is based who goes there before i saw the original black and white howard hawks film as with a lot of people that viewing was illicit on the tv when i should have been in bed that movie as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances seemed near perfection the suspense the inexplicable nature of the alien the photography it all just seemed to work i watched it many times in the years after and still do when it is shown on tv because of this i avoided the carpenter version for years seeing remakes of one's favourite film is i thought always a mistake when i did eventually watch it sometime in 1988 9 again on tv because there was nothing else on i realised that i need to change always a mistake to usually a mistake carpenter had produced something different from the original film closer to the original story and truly wonderful from the opening scene of the helicopter and husky through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog pound to that ending sorry no spoilers here i was hooked the sound track alone lives with me all i have to hear is a close similarity to that bass over snare drum beat and i'm in the final scene again br br until seeing the thing i had carpenter down as just another gore monkey based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press since seeing the thing i think i have seen most of his movies i haven't gone out of my to do so but if one comes up just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it he is thoughtful and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory br br if you haven't seen the thing and you enjoy science fiction do yourself a favour sit down in a dark room wrap up warm and prepare to have your memory enhanced
<START> this production build on real danish crime stories is a experience through excellent directing acting on all levels and has a nerve not often seen in crime series every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that this is my life right now this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve and the output is brilliant br br as a viewer you just have this wonderfully filling of being entertained cause it feels like their focus on purpose or not lie on that they wont you to have a good time o don't miss this one it's just right under 'band of brothers' quality and is a must have seen experience what a wonderful crime time
<START> the best bit in the film was when alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole it was also brilliant to see alan's bum going up and down like a elbow later on in the film br br alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa br br i've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit a brilliant idea by the script writers alan must be brought back into eastenders so he can do the same to peggy br br alan is back and this time he's armed with a razor watch out if you're a girl and he finds you and pulls your knickers down
<START> being a big fan of stanley kubrick's clockwork orange there was of course no question about it that i had to see this one however i put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like extremely boring or nothing happened a complete waste of time but when i saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith i was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001 a space odyssey there was no doubt in my mind that i was going to rent that movie the same evening br br it turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life of course watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it my god i like my friends a lot but it's a pity that i can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky that thing my friends is beauty as this film goes to show beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced intellectually shallow consumer driven fast food western societies that doesn't mean however that i reject these fast paced societies or that i look down on them and neither does kubrick but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in and what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming br br when we go to this place it is possible to get a so called natural high it is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty and never in my life has this natural high or spiritual orgasm as it is called by some or by others been more intense yes it's more intense than a regular orgasm several times more intense actually many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right are they right for me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe in my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter the four million year old black monolith has remained completely inert its origin and purpose are still a total mystery the trance that bowman experiences is the same thing i experience when watching those gorgeous visuals br br i can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast food answers to big questions but instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers the doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame but this film shows us that when fast statements give rise to nothing but doubt we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world from the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a thing in itself the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating enchanting and maybe even comforting we don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives when we are able to let mystery be what it is to embrace it even we can finally bring our souls to rest i am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us
<START> i've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems in the cruel light of 2007 a very sloppy late rko assembly line product all that endless documentary footage of fish waves fish waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time the editing is downright careless scenes just end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them the dialog bears the stilted traces of the odets origins high flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people but what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is on all sides i love stanwyck but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard douglas overplaying at being lovable then goes onto a would be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy as is ryan snarling and shouting most unnaturally the less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior keith whose character is kind of a neanderthal by today's standards nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as stanwyck's much younger one presumes brother and marilyn monroe as his girlfriend is natural and unaffected on windswept coast and all that footage while largely irrelevant is interesting as a document of what the town looked like amid all the overheated hysteria these two are islands of sanity a final point and a spoiler perhaps the breen office mandated it but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second stanwyck may temporarily have into being an obedient but i give the marriage a month
<START> this film without doubt is the clearest example of the british humour the germans can't understand one liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in british cinema history st trinians the story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post war trials enables frank to direct maximum talent from all the cast it's probably the only film in which margaret rutherford meets her match in alastair sim for forceful characterisation she still wins though joyce bless her and richard both deserve mentions in masterpiece of english etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure br br no rutherford sim fan would be without this in their collection absolutely brilliant why 9 10 only long
<START> this was the typical women prison movie i thought the women were very sexy and the outfits were great all the camera did was focus on the women and the women were always in provocative poses for the camera and they were always scantily dressed which i loved this is your basic prison breakout movie of the 70's all i can say about this film is that it's extremely cheesy but the women are gorgeous and their butts are great
