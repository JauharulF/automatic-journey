<START> i just finished watching the movie tonight and i truly loved it john denver didn't play a pastor but it was the reverend of the little town who decided to leave the floor for john denver to speak it's a really great movie with a wonderful christmas message it was also fun to watch
<START> wow what can i say i was born in 1960 i love bad tv movies love them i get involved the works i want to get involved i'm spending time watching the thing i watched the emmys last night on tv how in the infinite world was the empire falls excellent name tv movie up for any awards it truly had wonderful talent of course and they tried admirably but how can anyone pretend that was an ok tv for goodness sakes screenplay ok direction you know i wish everyone the best really but i thought it was totally mind bending that hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many honors awards for me it was sort of a wake up call that hollywood is such a small insular community being cynical is not really my thing but wow
<START> in this movie everything possible was wrong and i don't know why i bothered watching it until the end it would have been more fun watching paint dry for crying out loud i even liked d and it was much better than this here is the basic plot for you a redneck gets bitten by snakes that hold the evil of 13 murderers and becomes an undead killing machine murdering teenagers that have zero personality during the movie i lost hope when it didn't scare me at all when the kills were bad and there was bad cgi blood and cgi snakes it got worse with the cardboard thin characters killing their friend by holding her from her legs and not letting go so she got impaled by a tree and when the bad guy moved under water like the shark in jaws i'm still upset why i even bothered with this i guess because i'm a horror movie fan
<START> i being a fan of rupert rented this film a few months ago i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors it was entertaining and showed that rupert could play more than his most well known character of ron his subtle portrayal of ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable br br ben a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job he finds one and becomes the i guess you could call assistant to a retired actress at first it is just a way for him to earn some money but after a while he and seem to develop a friendship helps ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself and in the end they both seem to need each other br br whether you are a fan of rupert or not this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors
<START> i saw peter culloden and the war game a few months before this and was very impressed the technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film detailing on the one hand a trial of in california in the apparently near future and on the other the attempts of a group of convicted criminals to slog through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a government run punishment park as an alternative to prison films everything in a documentary style which causes for more than a little awkwardness or required strong suspension of disbelief how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery and that's merely the most obvious example but questionable storytelling aside this packs a punch no question you have to be interested in political film making to really get involved but the film really isn't like anything else of its era it pulls no punches offers no simple solutions the leftist political figures are certainly painted broadly at times but they aren't all alike the right wing government seem a little more cartoonish but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity overall the film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste 8 10 dvd rental
<START> this is one of the most satisfying of the book to tv adaptations the actress who make us believe that a borg could be sexy makes us believe that a spy and traitor can have some redeeming qualities br br the tv plot line does not follow cornwell's story exactly but is both exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a darn good yarn if you have a yen for romance in uniform there is a lot of sexual energy sparking between our man sharpe and the lying hussy made me wish her role was closer to that in the books but no matter there is enough hero wronged hero redeemed hero in rage hero in flight and hero in battle to keep you clued to your dvd play
<START> i agree with another reviewer this is such a shattering film that will be tough to watch again soon though for quality alone it deserves repeated viewing the complexity of the characters the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching br br there is one scene of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol that's perhaps for sheer physicality the most amazing performance i've ever seen in fact though not episodic the story flows this is a movie of memorable scenes there's the passing of rations amongst the partisans the snow scenes the ruined farm scene the encounters in the houses the interrogation the basement scene the ascent all stand out like jewels in a necklace br br for me the religiosity isn't overt frankly i don't think it would have been permitted in a soviet film i do see this as an existential parable about the value of life here is a tale where the hero and he is a true hero becomes the villain and the weaker one becomes the stronger one is this a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances there is a but does it come from within or without you must see the movie to understand the issues for they can't be discussed without giving away too much of the story i can't say enough about the acting it's hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting i'm not familiar with soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors but they are all superb i also note how director uses children they remind me of child angels br br there is a little muddling in the end there is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier and the interrogator but this is left dangling and the final scene is a bit ambiguous but compared to the total experience these are quibbles this is a movie that will mark you for life
<START> in alfred hitchcock's adaptation of patricia strangers on a train guy haines farley granger and bruno anthony robert walker meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders the rather pushy anthony suggests that he could murder haines' unfaithful wife and haines could murder anthony's domineering father the lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved the tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious complications arise later when anthony murders haines' wife in an amusement park and then pursues haines to keep his side of the bargain br br the differences between the two men are clear from the start haines is a professional tennis player respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas anthony's life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling haines is in a relationship with a senator's daughter who he wants to marry anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on haines' part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career the character differences are also reinforced visually anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called pluto whereas haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles br br there are some striking visual sequences such as br br 1 the murder of haines' wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from anthony br br 2 the depiction of anthony alone dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white jefferson memorial building br br 3 the occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison following the action whilst one head anthony's chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at haines br br 4 the scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly br br frequent use is made of doubles throughout the story for example haines and anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train as the train pulls out of the station there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward the 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double the hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass haines feels double crossed when his wife on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce haines' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends when anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the senator's younger daughter who he sees as a double for haines' wife anthony also feels double crossed when haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder when haines is travelling alone in a train going to metcalf he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and anthony had br br the action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of robert walker and patricia hitchcock as the senator's younger daughter are particularly powerful
<START> the 1970s are often regarded as a golden age of british television comedy a period which saw numerous classic sitcoms as well as sketch shows such as monty python's flying circus the period was however emphatically not a golden age of british film comedy and what worked well on television rarely transferred successfully to the big screen the most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the pythons but their best films monty python and the holy grail and life of brian were very different in conception to their tv show br br the main problem with adapting sitcoms for the cinema is that concepts devised to fit the bbc's 30 minute slots 25 minutes on itv which has to find room for commercials do not always work as well when expanded into a feature film three or four times as long few people will remember the film versions of say up or steptoe and son with the same affection as the television versions in the case of many classic tv comedy shows some mothers do 'em yes minister fawlty towers the goodies no attempt was made to film them at all for which we can be grateful characters such as michael crawford's frank spencer or john cleese's basil fawlty can be hilarious in half hour doses but i doubt if they would remain as funny over two hours one comedy programme albeit a dramatisation of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense which might have worked in the cinema was the fall and rise of reginald but any hopes of a film were dashed by the tragically early death of its star leonard br br dad's army was one of the few television sitcoms of the period which was turned into a decent film about the only other one i can think of was porridge this was possibly because it had an unusually large number of well developed characters and derived most of its humour from the interactions between them the original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the misadventures of a home guard platoon in the small seaside town of walmington on sea the home guard initially known as the local defence volunteers was an auxiliary militia during world war ii made up for the most part of men too old to serve in the regular forces the film version is a three act drama act i deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members in act ii they cause havoc during an army training exercise in act iii they succeed in capturing a group of nazi airmen whose plane has been shot down br br the three key players in this drama are the commander captain george arthur lowe and his two subordinates sergeant arthur wilson john le mesurier and corporal jack jones clive dunn who in civilian life is the local bank manager is a fussy little man peering at the world through a pair of thick spectacles it is he who takes the initiative in forming the home guard unit and who appoints himself its commander he is pompous officious with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and of his own powers of leadership the sort of man who does not suffer fools gladly and in george world view the term fool covers most of the rest of the human race he does however have his good qualities he is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage shown in his encounter with the germans br br wilson is deputy at the bank the two men are very different in character something emphasised by a difference in appearance wilson being tall and thin whereas is short and stout he comes across as being both more intelligent and better educated than his boss his accent suggests he may be a former public schoolboy nevertheless he has ended up playing second fiddle both in civilian and military life probably because he has the sort of passive personality which leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take anything altogether seriously jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher's shop his promotion to corporal is due mainly to his ability to bribe with black market sausages his enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos although his catchphrase is don't panic he is prone to panicking at any given opportunity br br several other members of the platoon are featured private fraser the dour scottish undertaker is even more of a pessimist than wilson catchphrase we're doomed man doomed private godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is the whereabouts of the nearest lavatory private walker is a sharp cockney spiv and private pike another bank employee a spoilt mummy's boy pike's mother is wilson's mistress although wilson tries to keep this liaison secret from the disapproving two significant outsiders are the mild mannered vicar and the arp warden detested enemy and quite his equal in and br br there are occasional bawdy doubles entendres keep your hands off my privates is ostensibly referring to those soldiers who hold that rank more so than in the television show which was surprisingly free of innuendo its creators david croft and jimmy perry would later go on to create comedy shows such as are you being served and hi de hi which were notorious for suggestive humour the film does however preserve much of the mixture of gentle wit nostalgia and sharp characterisation which made the tv series so successful 7 10
<START> i don't recommend watching this movie it's a movie in which a movie is being filmed with no attraction between actress and actor being played the sex scene at the end of the movie which is to explain the reluctance of the actress being played in the movie to cooperate with the actor being played in the movie in it is a blunt repetition of the same scene in the movie fat girl everything there was played with more delicacy if you can attach delicacy to a sex act like that a typical french expression for the the thing happening in sex is comedy is oh la la in film brief crossing there also is sensitivity in sex is comedy i don't see real sensitivity and also a clear plot for the movie is not being developed so that there is a rather loose story with the disillusion of the end
<START> a couple of help a group of mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement this low key western is unusual for ford in that it lacks any big stars johnson gets top billing but his is basically a supporting role although he and carey work well together dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest the best performance is given by ford favorite bond playing the leader of the mormons in fact this role helped him land a starring role in the long running tv western wagon train before his untimely death at age 57 featuring beautiful cinematography ford regarded this as one of his favorite films
<START> i remember catching this movie on one of the showtime channels what stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in phoenix arizona i'm from there so i spot the locales easily br br regardless a ninja kills a scientist because they wear yellow sweaters and golf who is pursued by the police it takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him there are no discernible bullet wounds his spirit lives on however when a woman finds her and touches his katana br br from then on she periodically gets possessed and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja then another ninja from japan comes to kill the evil ninja this might be a plot device from the previous two films or perhaps a plot hole all i know is that this movie is very campy bad and entertaining this is something to watch with a tub of popcorn and several friends and give it the mst3k treatment
<START> just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun this is a pure slice of the 1970s even the cops need haircuts badly shot in and around london the plot of the american ex con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in mayfair and then has the screws put on by crime lord david niven and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well handled br br i liked its simplicity and even innocence it harks back to a time when caper films where just that a caper and violence wasn't a part of the deal br br all in all you could do a lot worse than watch this it has enough twists and turns to give it some oomph and a cast that obviously had fun making it br br nicely made and watchable
<START> i like most other people saw this movie after hearing of it from patton oddly enough it was easier to find than i thought it would be though it shouldn't come as a surprise that i found it used br br the plot is summed upped masterfully within the title it's a bed that eats nothing more nothing less there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good one br br a demon's blood ended up on a bed and as a result it becomes possessed it devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange there is an artist who fell victim to the bed but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits the narrative is told entirely through him br br this movie fails horribly at everything even at being bad still it's not without its own brand of charm
<START> sherlock holmes basil rathbone and professor moriarty lionel atwill engage in a battle of wits for control of a inventor's newest bomb sight creation holmes wants to safeguard it for the british while moriarty isn't above selling out to the nazis br br while no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see holmes updated to the 1940s war time setting this particular film proves light hearted fun which doesn't wallow in wartime propaganda as it might well have done dennis inspector lestrade and nigel bruce's dr watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief the sparring between holmes and is colorful and well thought out to boot atwill does well enough as moriarty even if he's not as memorable as some others who played the role br br while this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series it is a wonderful escape from reality somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more compact less repetitive plot and all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of sherlock holmes
