<START> god that sucked you can't end a horror movie with a happily ever after family setting i was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act but my god he didn't have to kill the girl she didn't die the ghost father appears with a cure which makes no sense because his spirit would have been liberated after the yank kid killed all the bad werewolves what a hunk of junk this is the worst horror movie i've seen in a long time and i've watched a lot of horror movies this is a slap in the face for landis and everyone else involved in american werewolf in london i hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar julie delphy and cgi kind of new and chic back in 1997 but today it just looks drab compared to the artful prosthetic makeup work of london anyway i'm done i hope i've scared a few people of get the original instead or failing that the howling or failing that watch american idol reruns just don't watch this mess
<START> this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best if you want a simple cute story however you won't find it here the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state
<START> what a cast of actors and actresses in this columbo episode beside peter falk you have julie newmar jeannette nolan martin landau as twins anyway the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancÃ© julie newmar who plays the role so deliciously jeannette nolan plays the other woman of the house the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar martin landau plays identical twins in this one each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money well you'll just have to watch and see the outcome but i can assure you that it's always worth watching this one for the cast and the crew
<START> history and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the and thing anyone can do but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986 basically the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort security and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves which they hide from themselves with more sex this drive is linked to the decline of the american empire as expressed in an early interview within the movie br br so the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames revealing their ultimate loneliness and cutting rapidly between them showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement and to give arcand credit this is pretty much what intellectual life is a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone br br but yeah the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic i think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last which makes it kind of dated it's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like susan that makes art house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers in all i'll take it anyway it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters br br polarisdib
<START> this is probably the best movie from director hector it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners which is the same reality that haunts all of the latin american countries poverty and a survival instinct the most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a dog eat dog society many times falling into the gap of delinquency prostitution and crime very well acted and with a no frills approach this movie will get to you great story plot a must have movie on anybody's collection the starring role went to fernando ramos da silva a young boy who fell into the crime wave killed some years later during a robbery i would suggest people to watch the movie who killed pixote so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters some other characters from the movie had a similar fate some died and others are in jail none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory
<START> well acted drama based on a novel by arthur miller something as simple as a pair of glasses becomes life altering lawrence newman william h macy is a man that has chosen to be satisfied with his mundane life the same job for twenty years and still living with his mother he is told by his boss to correct his vision with a pair of glasses newman's life drastically changes and delves him into hell the glasses he chose makes him look jewish he looses his job and becomes the object of heavy scrutiny by his brooklyn neighborhood searching for a job he encounters the attractive and outspoken gertrude laura dern herself living with conflict because of her jewish appearance soon the couple's new life together becomes a nightmare filled with humiliation and bigotry driven attacks a very apt cast that features joseph ziegler peter kay hawtrey and of musical fame meat loaf
<START> definitely a must see for all fans of film noir br br thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller br br wonderful characterizations articulate the movie's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance it's difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn't a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling br br making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage now all these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it's refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like crossfire br br another low budget gem from the hollywood archives
<START> br br this movie really has nothing going for it with the reverend played by phillip seymour hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2 5 hour movie you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in literally it's a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment dreadful br br
<START> after a decade of turbulent unrest american movies began to switch gears and turn their cameras away from war torn battlefields political corruption and general social unease to the more intimate world of family dysfunction the toll the selfish baby boomers began to take on the american family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt br br kramer vs kramer is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s and it's one of the best it gets a rather bum rap now because it's known as the film that beat apocalypse now for the 1979 best picture academy award but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast they're not remotely the same but can't we enjoy them both director writer robert benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie its strength lies in its performances those of dustin hoffman and meryl streep particularly playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son the courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways is devastating and feels authentic the movie doesn't present hoffman's solid dad as a hero or streep's straying mom as a villain they're neither good or bad as people they're simply bad at being married br br the film is tear jerky at the finale but not in a manipulative way it earns its right to elicit sobs br br grade a
<START> the first thing you see in this film is a static angle one which will be repeated later in the film depicting the chaos going on unseen to the audience in a studio that airs news soon after fonda's character's typical story is shown in that same angle don't let this mislead you the film is not about a female reporter a woman struggling to succeed in a male dominated profession that is merely a lead in a way of starting the film though it's used later the actual point to this production is revealed gradually and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on the entire film has that pace not slow or drawn out but deliberate it's never really fast even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so this pacing especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed as the disturbing unsettling nature of the film is unraveled is strong almost painful to the viewer it inspires you to if it had been possible jump into the screen grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to remedy the situation never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment the subject is extremely important to be aware of and it's handled perfectly here no over dramatization well very little anyway just an accurate presentation of the issue the direction is astounding the empathy felt for lemmon's character is profound the editing is masterful one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly the editor judging from his filmography is vastly underrated the writing was excellent the acting was great in particular by lemmon fonda and douglas who also produced it the lack of a score is perfect no music is needed to enhance the ending is sublime and effective the movie does have a few negative points among them some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition one particular part of the film whilst dramatic doesn't seem to mesh with something that follows it not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly and rightfully so attributed to bad movies the pacing which can be mistaken as being slow and the lack of score one could argue that to be a negative thing as everyone ought to consider the points it presents but maybe it's better this way handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect for the topic as well as the viewer something like this maybe it shouldn't be spoon fed i was mesmerized with the film and left very taken aback i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it 9 10
<START> there are a select few cartoon films where animals or something not human is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them apart from a few points of the plot and the characters this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals although it's good someone did not i feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans br br this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues which is rather odd for a disney film it mentions alcohol shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack humans and it shows a male cat called abraham thomas o' fancying a female cat in a surprisingly human and adult way br br as a cartoon film or just a film in general i feel this is pretty good quality the storyline and characters are especially good the film in general is set in france and you meet a family of cats the mother duchess and her kittens marie toulouse and you also meet the kind rich old woman who adores the cats the butler edgar and an old man who has clearly lost his marbles called george the kind old woman discusses her will with george and edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it he is incredibly cross with this and has an evil scheme in mind br br a very cute film for every age enjoy aristocats br br not including basil the great mouse detective and a few others maybe which i cannot think of at the moment
<START> the atmosphere in this show is great there's plenty of excellent buildup but thats where this show fails there's way to much build up for nothing you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then nothing over and over again nothing you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none they show up at these peoples doors talk about their deep and emotional pasts set up lame equipment and find nothing there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything paranormal i laugh every time they need to exercise a horrible spirit that we as an audience have seen nothing of they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing nothing
<START> could contain spoilers read only after seeing last episode season 2 think about it the guys on the north pole center of the earth looking for abnormal magnetic behavior they also said something about did we miss it again so there was another abnormality of course that was when the plain crashed i think this whole island is a setup set up by her daddy she found out about it and is looking for her desmond how else can she know what to look for br br so basically it's an island in a magnetic shield all of it is fake all the signs are there fake beards fake doors fake medicine fake observations stations with fake air shafts that lead to nothing it's a project indeed and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with desmond his chick and her dad and probably libby she's weird maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing ok now i'm drifting off br br also in this episode henry gail tells michael to go to some coordinates and he'll find rescue their this is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield once you're gone there is no way back br br i think it's pretty obvious despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season if you think back on what we've learned in season 1 and 2 i'm sure we'll get loads of answers in season 3 br br can't wait br br can anyone agree on this theory hope to hear from you
<START> this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting it comes across as a poorly conceived rip off of 2001 br br the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects but even that wasn't enough to keep me from nodding off i would like to get the soundtrack especially the music during the space flight sequence for nights when i have trouble falling asleep
<START> i actually saw the movie before i read the book when i saw the movie i was upset because i wondered why dean koontz had made such a bad book movie the movie was confusing and didn't have a flow at all it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the tv i couldn't connect with the characters at all so i didn't care about what happened to them normally i love the characters because i can relate to their personality or problems then i read the book and loved it i often re read the book and the movie is collecting dust i wish someone would make a koontz movie that follows the plot of his books then the movies wouldn't suck so much do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money
