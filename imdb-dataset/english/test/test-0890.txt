<START> unlike some of the former commentators i was and am an avid fan of the carpenters face it christmas would never be christmas without the carpenters that said i believe the movie did a good not excellent job at depicting karen's life the movie was enjoyable to see on primetime tv but the content fell a little short i suggest that you all look into getting some of the carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's you cannot believe how awesome a drummer karen was cynthia did not capture the extent of karen's talent also karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser my choice for playing karen is hilary swank i would love to see a more substantive story because there was more to karen than meets the eyes when listening to we've only just begun i have tons of unreleased music and it is absolutely excellent her singing of california dreamin is to die for
<START> most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the movies for men channel today i loved the film's story cinematography as well as the superb casting of ben johnson and harry carey jr in the lead roles along with the ever dependable ward bond apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series train' which featured bond once again as the boss of the wagon trains heading west johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like ben does in this movie other notables include the lovely joanne dru as denver and an early non speaking role for james arness who later became famous for his marshal matt dillon role in ' if you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one
<START> after the across the board success of my name is barbra cbs television permitted barbra to create an even more elaborate follow up as her second special streisand wisely knew in order to follow in the ground breaking success of my name is barbra that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle not surprisingly she succeeded once again even more impressively streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of my name is barbra br br once again the special is divided into three distinct acts filming on location at bergdorf goodman's department store was so successful in the first special that streisand and company decided to film on location once again for the first act of this second special the decided upon location this time was the philadelphia art museum which would allow endless chances for barbra to enter different art works that would correspond with the songs being performed in addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color br br after the recording of draw me a circle that is set against the opening credits barbra then dashes around the museum in a maid costume to the strains of kern and yesterdays she stops to admire various paintings and statues often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song streisand performs a bittersweet rendition of hammerstein and one kiss as thomas concert singer delivers a hilariously campy performance of minute waltz as marie antoinette embraces abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of peter gotta move and performs a wrenching rendition of non c'est rien as a distraught girl the high point of act i however is when streisand compares profiles with the bust sculpture of egyptian queen while singing a tour de force rendition of rogers and hart's where or when the act ii circus medley allows streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals while singing various songs with farm circus animal themes some highlights include barbra singing were thine that special face to a baby elephant performing i've grown accustomed to that face as a serenade to a piglet the campy sam you made the pants to long sung to a group of baby penguins and barbra comparing profiles with an while crooning we have so much in common streisand also swings on a trapeze and leaps from a trampoline to the chorus of spring again and then slows things down by performing a haunting version of i stayed too long at the fair while seated alone on stage barbra also gets the chance to show off her pet poodle sadie in this segment and even speak a little french br br the act iii concert is once again the high point of the hour dressed in a white wool dress the concert segment is performed on a uniquely designed stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere streisand opens the act with a sultry rendition of harold anyplace i hang my hat is home before launching into heartfelt versions of the familiar standard it had to be you and the rarely heard c'est si bon it's so good streisand then really amazes the audience with a breathtakingly powerful soaring performance of the sweet charity ballad where am i going of which streisand delivers the definitive rendition of streisand also introduces the then newly written richard jr david shire ballad starting here starting now which contains an impassioned vocal from streisand that ranks among the very best vocal performances of her long career br br more than anything else color me barbra was a showcase for streisand's ever increasing mega watt star power despite the presence of even more visual razzle dazzle streisand herself is always the main attraction her voice sounds as beautiful as ever and this special was the first to showcase how strikingly she photographs in color as with my name is barbra color me barbra was another rating smash and spawned yet another top five gold selling soundtrack album simply put color me barbra defies tradition and emerges as a sequel that is nearly on par with a classic original
<START> the man who knew too much 1955 is alfred hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple james stewart and doris day on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder espionage assassinations and the worst of all kidnapping of their 10 years old son the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun stewart and day have a good chemistry together the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense br br the inclusion of que sera sera proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like que sera sera did in the man who knew too much br br hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin storm cloud for almost ten minutes while scene in london's royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both the scene and the are simply marvelous
<START> i saw this film last night at a pre code film festival and i have to tell you that when gary cooper turned his head for his introductory close up the entire audience gasped he was just that beautiful br br cooper's looks aside this film displays directorial artistry to perfection wonderful scene fades creative camera angles symbolic allusions mamoulian just keeps exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovation br br this was sylvia sidney's first role in hollywood after her success on the new york stage and she is just as lovely as a gary cooper leading lady ought to be it's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she was given so often she looks like she's afraid she's about to be hit by someone br br there are lots of familiar faces in this film including the wonderful gibson most striking is guy kibbee best known for playing fatuous rich men as a grinning and mendacious hit man br br there aren't nearly enough of these pre code films available on vhs or dvd so if you can't find a pre code festival near you try campaigning turner classic movies for a broadcast as for the reviewer who believes gary cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than yep or nope he should perhaps consider coop's performance in films such as mr deeds goes to town or meet john doe although heaven knows anyone who looked that good shouldn't have to be smart as well
<START> buy this if you like rock led or just want an amazing experience world class i love this band and the dvd was even better than i had hoped for believe me if you took the time to read this thread you need this dvd period
<START> this was the second cinemascope spectacle that fox produced after the robe notice how some of the roman sets are redressed to pass for egyptian sets the film is produced with all first class elements beautiful photography stirring soundtrack alfred newman and bernard herrmann see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes however the principal acting is a bit weak edmund purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch the best performances come from peter ustinov as the one eyed slave and polish actress bella as the babylonian temptress i find this movie in general to be strong on plot which is rare for these large spectacles produced at the time all in all the film does an interesting and entertaining job of social commentary on what egyptian society might have looked like
<START> in the line of fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse clint eastwood is plagued by john malkovich in this riveting film malkovich says he's going to kill the president and he purposely calls eastwood and pushes his buttons he questions eastwood's ability to protect someone malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mindset to his character everything he does he does for a reason and he's not shy about killing eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch malkovich but no one wants to listen to him the result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the hotel wolfgang peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn

<START> the primary plus for this movie is the combination of chris farley and david spade this was the first film in which this comedy duo displayed their laurel and hardy esque brand of humor obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly augmented by spade's sarcastic take on every situation they find themselves in br br this movie stands apart from other comedy movies tommy boy ranks in with blues brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits stem from the plot rather than serve to break up the storyline and give the film a disjointed feel as so many other comedic films do thanks to excellent direction by sagal every scene is tight and immediately foreshadows or acts out the story being told he is as much to credit for the film's hilariousness as farley and spade are the acting of dennehy lowe ackroyd and many others see the gas station attendant 22 miles from davenport strengthen the film br br the film warrants multiple viewings because there are many fine to the film that may be overshadowed by farley spade br br i believe this film is very well made and is the funniest movie i have ever seen
<START> this 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship potemkin at the port of odessa the movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 which was seen as a direct precursor to the october revolution of 1917 following his montage theory eisenstein plays with scenes their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques the odessa steps sequence in potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema the baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in brian d' palma's the untouchables it is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes
<START> loosely based on actual events river's edge is a film much in the style of david lynch about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends but no one does anything about it for a long time with top notch acting by crispin glover and dennis hopper we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film br br the film begins with a young boy tim joshua john miller dropping a doll off of a bridge murder 1 tim then hears someone yelling when he looks up he sees samson daniel roebuck standing on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him murder 2 samson eventually shows the body to his friends all of which are horrified not only because of the murder but also because the victim jamie was a friend of theirs despite all of this no one goes to the police you may think this is unrealistic but this is what happened in the real story if you are familiar with the story of alpha dog 2006 you will know that the same thing happened there as well through all of this crispin glover is working to keep samson safe although no one including samson seems to care about keeping him out of harms way as time goes on we learn that dennis hopper a middle aged shut in who deals drugs to the local teenagers has also killed a woman before murder 3 from here things begin to close in on samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed but not in the way you may be expecting br br in the film we learn of three murders each one with a different reason a different reaction and a different effect on those involved when tim drops his younger sister's doll off of the bridge we are never made aware of his motive however we do see the reaction of the younger sister she cries and screams while her mother consoles her later her older brother matt keanu reeves helps her put a cross in the yard in remembrance of her doll the murder of jamie horrifies everyone except samson who is apathetic to the whole situation and when asked by why he did it samson replies with she was talking sh t but they do not sob or scream the run away and go on with their lives trying to forget what had happened in situation he did not kill his girlfriend out of hate we never really know why he killed her but we see that is not proud of what he had done he even mentions that he is sorry and that her loved her from this we see the different ways we can be affected by death in the film it is easy for us to identify with the teenagers because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about the death of their friend in much the same way we the audience do not know how to feel because we do not know jamie we are obviously saddened by the death and realize that samson should be arrested but we don't feel strongly for jamie as an individual br br there are several similarities between river's edge and twin peaks 1990 1991 especially in the overall feel of the film i wonder if mark frost and david lynch were thinking of river's edge when they were creating their series after all tim hunter did go on to direct three episodes of twin peaks br br crispin glover's performance as the hyperactive frantic is an oscar worthy performance always in a rush and always worried about keeping samson from getting caught is an intense character that seems to be on speed if you have seen crispin glover in any film you know that he can deliver a line like no one else it is always a treat to see him perform the other great performance in river's edge is by dennis hopper his portrayal of the shut in drug dealer who has one leg and an sex doll he talks to named elly reminded me of a more toned down and more humorous version of frank booth hopper's character in david lynch's film blue velvet 1986 br br river's edge is great film and i believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in reality we need to step up and speak out against the evils in the world
<START> i grew up in new york city and every afternoon abc would show the 4 30 movie saratoga trunk was one of the first movies i remember watching as a kid i loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years i recently watched it again and still thought it was great maybe i am just a romantic but i thought it was well done i do not want to say this movie was good only because of the main actors i really did not know who they were when i first saw this movie i guess i just knew quality acting as a child both bergman and cooper were excellent i especially loved seeing old new orleans during the time period of this movie if you ever get a chance to visit new orleans you should watch movies that show the city during that time period when you get to see some of the old homes in the french quarter not just bourbon street or uptown you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago br br i love old movies this one to me is a good flick
<START> i tried watching this movie but i didn't make it past the first 15 minutes it's a terrible disappointment considering the cast but i can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in english and some of the actors pretending to be indian are not even close read kristin kreuk considering that india alone has 1 6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries i don't think it would have been hard for the film makers to have found an excellent indian actress to play the part and i don't say so because of some blind patriotism but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non indian to play the role of an indian pakistani now some people say that 'as long as she's convincing who cares ' but my point is exactly that she's not convincing and never can be not due to her acting skills but due to her ethnicity for example however good an actor tom hanks may be he'll never be able to play an australian aborigine br br but that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film makers made having the dialogue in english it totally destroys the mood as well as any semblance of authenticity had the same movie been made in native languages hindi urdu punjabi with english subtitles this may have been an excellent movie unfortunately as things stand i would not recommend anyone seeing it apart from film students who want to study what not to do in movies
<START> i am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on imdb it belongs in the 2 bin at your local video store to say that this is a b movie is extremely generous br br besides lacking a single redeemable character only slightly better than average acting and an ugly 80's style picture quality the script for this film is dull and lifeless this film is not only boring it is pathetic admittedly there is occasionally some mildly interesting chemistry between the two main characters even the final plot twist rather the only plot twist does not save this film br br rent diamond men if you must but do not hesitate to turn it off once you become of its worthlessness 2 out of 10
