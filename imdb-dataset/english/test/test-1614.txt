<START> this movie was not that good at all here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie harrison ford's name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title the music was nominated for an oscar what the heck was that that music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie the acting was sub par at best except the amish boy he did a decent job for being so young then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place and it won for adapted the music was horrid i know i already said something but it was really bad the premises was real good and it should be remade well that's all i really have on that br br your average movie guy br br

<START> many accuse rod steiger of overacting and anyone who has seen the amityville horror and the section would struggle to say otherwise that said he's brilliant in this br br it's never on tv you can't buy it on dvd legitimately in 1988 when channel 4 still had a prescription for innovation they showed this amongst a small amalgam of 60s films privilege etc and i remember an essentially theatrical experience transposed well to film the great thing about theatre is it's enclosed how do you make it available and interesting on screen ph just about pulls it off because this sort of film is never even on cable or sky tv anywhere it's hard to get a debate going but for anyone out there who has seen it or can remember my memories are of a forthright almost strident performance by sally geeson all taken care of' which eschews the almost diffident general performances of her and her sibling in many early 70s offerings she says ref conception there are several of these key lines you remember years decades on that's the power of a film like this br br ps i just saw it again and its just as good one day tv too will be enlightened
<START> above all you must not take this movie seriously it takes itself seriously unfortunately but that can't be helped this anime ninja flic has to be the crowning achievement in spoiling what could have been an endearing if unoriginal story with bad plot twists ridiculous time killing cutscenes and one outrageous guest appearance which will either make you laugh or groan or both like me br br while i'm typically a fan of ninja samurai anime ninja scroll and to name a few this one has to be the exception for the record from a technical point of view of its time this movie was very well animated and constructed it is just the plot that stunk the authors of this movie clearly decided for what rational reason i don't know that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway around the world in search of a treasure that he learns his father fought and died for in the process he saves a black slave named sam meets a french girl who is living in an apache village makes friends with a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him meets more family members then he knew he had in the weirdest places and circumstances and whom all subsequently die at some point in the movie br br even so far these ludicrous plot twists could be excused but then come the two guest appearances 1 after having a cliche showdown with two cowboys meets a man who introduces himself as mark twain at this point you're probably saying what the this meeting serves one purpose it entirely discredits a movie which tries to add to itself an educated historical background i found it disappointing that the authors went to all this trouble to research the 1860s us and didn't manage to realize that mark twain's real name was samuel clemens 2 when finally finds the treasure it turns out that it used to belong to captain kidd i can hear the groans of disgust now br br finally there are the running scenes these scenes show various characters running with the landscape moving behind them for several minutes and there are a lot of them it is these scenes which make this movie 2hrs 12 min to seem to last a week and a half br br if you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitled movie that just asks to be made fun of this is it feel free to poke fun at every possible aspect of it and have fun just don't take it seriously 3 10
<START> my son adam 5 years old is a big scooby doo fan he like this film a lot he particularly liked when the loch ness monster tried to attack shaggy and scooby the vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters br br having seen the vampire rock film first this not surprisingly was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting br br few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the tv cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children you either like this or love it i loved scooby doo for half an hour as a kid i am happy my son loves it i can just about put up with it now
<START> this was a highly hyped movie prior to its release but turned out to be a dud i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie i agree i didn't like it either perhaps one big reason it wasn't a box office success was that it had nothing but unappealing characters in the story br br for awhile there i don't know if this is still true i hadn't any movie in which laura linney or dylan walsh played anything but annoying characters br br that and a stupid story make this film a big disappointment especially considering that big buildup did the filmmakers with dialog this dumb really think this was going to be a hit
<START> caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack but there are legitimate reasons for it 1 rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn't like the script wanted to change it his request was denied so he didn't do the film 2 it was low budget bill murray had grown to superstar status ted knight passed away in 1986 and chevy chase the so called ace of the first movie although it was rodney all the way be on more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him but you had dan aykroyd robert stack randy quaid and jackie mason all serviceable substitutes who none had their best performances
<START> first there was tsui hark's zu warriors 2001 which is visually ground breaking but much lacking in the acting and writing departments now this movie which is visually almost as good as zu though no longer ground breaking but is even worse in the acting and writing departments it's really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the hk movie industry i guess you need to understand cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are it's like some delinquent kids talking in the street it's that bad to make it worse the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids and can't act even if their life depend on it i understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in hk but has hk youths really become so brain dead that they can't appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting writing if that's the case it makes me ashamed to be from hk br br i wish hk movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like zhang yi mou or ang lee and finally make a movie that's both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments and stop using young singers idols heartthrobs as actors because they can't act however many fans they may have in hk
<START> hey look you don't watch this movie to change your life but if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for richard gere this movie is right up your street diane lane and richard gere have on screen chemistry going way back in is not a oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric beautifully shot love story between middle aged good looking people they don't make your stomach turn and even when gere is 'on top' he does not look too then this is the movie for you i loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways of course the whole thing was presented in a superficial way glossed over and not really dealt with i mean i would have liked to know more about the father son relationship between gere and james franco but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change you for the better whether it is a lover a child a friend etc the theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways i was kind of surprised that james franco took such a small part in this film but he is always good even for a few minutes screen time i really liked this film because it was moving and sweet
<START> spoilers this film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of johnny carson to determine who would succeed him the impersonations of david letterman and jay leno are performed in a satisfactory way by john michael higgins and daniel roebuck though the performances weren't great reni santoni is the best performing of the execs he plays john of nbc and warren littlefield played by bob is a close second i was shocked at the way in which littlefield eagerly discussed dumping johnny carson this was johnny carson this scene evinces the cut throat what have you done for me lately world of television kathy bates delivered the best performance of the film as jay's agent helen another commenter asserted that leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film i respectfully disagree the relationship with bordered on something akin to domestic violence she orders him around and when he rebels against her at the end she tries to play the sympathy card mentioning her dead husband and son however when jay terminates their relationship she turns violent again screaming don't you leave me you two faced bastard before smashing a picture on the floor overall the movie is hilarious and i wish that it were shown more often
<START> this was a modest attempt at a film though it appeared more like a tv pilot extended br br some may find this unfair but it looks like someone saw the brothers and save the last dance and thought hey i could do that too well not quite br br while i personally found the movie predictable somewhat poorly acted and contrived watch for the cookies carl payne shows that he can carry off a lead role and should be back on television the leading lady can't remember her name sorry was plausible too but you keep thinking of julia stiles she was the one in save the last dance right because this one was really stuck in white girl mode
<START> a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries is a very beautiful greek island that keeps many of the novel's characteristics i think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie one thing i didn't like at all though is that the main characters like and father weren't greek actors but foreigners i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot irene papas was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the 40's who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone john hurt father also acted great he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions
<START> piranha starts out as expected stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them i thought for a while it might be a cannibal film it starts off like so many others showing nothing but shots off untouched amazon rain forest for all i know it could be florida at this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up instead you get the acting talents of william smith who starred in l a vice and angels die hard he plays an acclaimed hunter who i would describe him as jack palance light he is bigger in stature but not quite the jack palance goodness as for natives you don't really get that many where's the piranha should i even ask that question now hunts humans i guess he doesn't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though just stares at them does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over dramatic smokey and the bandit kind of way the motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence i can't tell you how many times i've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle never actually do they live do they die will you care anybody wanna race on motorcycles caution this film contains extreme dry look my advice is to rent a jack palance classic like craze
<START> it seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing sex don't get me wrong i'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all i'm interested in is highly offensive take the a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and or a script that wasn't written by a six year old this is essentially the craft with supposedly hot guys and yeah that's it it bored me to tears even my friend who usually laps us crap films hated it it is really stunningly bad to the extent where it can actually be funny i would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it they were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the really clichÃ© boy on boy kiss happened towards the end watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film i don't think mainstream hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers or indeed for anyone so i think i'll give up unless you're a teen who likes the pussycat dolls thinks paris hilton is hot and watches mtv it's like some sort of wasteland life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house p s someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members totally hawt lol 111
<START> well there isnt much to say about this movie its simply trash very poor acting poor script and lame story well the actress i even know her name who played not the blond one but latina one was acting fine but the blond one who played the friend of main charactor her acting level is just like highschool play so as most of other actors in the movie also zombies very bad acting as well and the story itself has really no point at all well if you are really bored and really got nothing to do but wanna kill time somehow maybe you may wanna watch this movie but there are still millions of better b movies than this crap its total waste of money and time
