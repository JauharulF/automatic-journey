<START> being a huge horror movie fan one of the most difficult things to be considering the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre and having seen hundreds of them in my lifetime i have to say that dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired lame and poorly done piece of trash i have had the misfortune to see stay away from this movie it's so bad it's not even laughable the special effects did i say special were probably achieved spending a couple of grand the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project the whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse also for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies don't be fooled by the r rating if you're thinking you get a chance to see erika eleniak even half naked you're wrong she is fully clothed throughout the entire movie and the cover art is completely misleading there is no scene in any part of the movie that even marginally resembles the awesome cover art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans br br too bad the rating is only 1 to 10 i would give this movie a 10 be warned don't waste your money or your time on this one
<START> goldeneye is one of the best n64 releases ever br br better than this game well star wars rogue squadron star wars episode i racer and the legend of zelda ocarina of time are far better and superior games but i still love goldeneye br br this is the best adaptation from a movie second only to star wars adaptations the story is perfect it's like you are in the movie itself br br the graphics are excellent the movements are extremely realistic the enemies' artificial intelligence are the best part in this game i loved playing the stage in which james and break from the janus base as the goldeneye prepares to burn it escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult eluding cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the gameplay br br it's also the toughest game i've ever played n64 games are usually very very easy goldeneye is the one exception i'm still trying to beat the 00 agent difficult level but winning the easier levels was already a great victory i loved when alec asked for england james i answered no for me it happened just in the moment i blasted him to death just like in the movie i love accomplishing every objective br br the multiplayer gaming is even better at first i got killed every holy second now i know how to win i love forcing my playmates by playing at license to kill br br the music and sound are astounding super mario 64 looks like an atari next to this the only thing i still wanted to hear was the goldeneye theme song that plays at the end of the movie br br after zelda was released i nearly forgot i still had this game it's still excellent even if it's already surpassed i hope other 007 games are produced br br fantastic job nintendo was very smart to release this game on the n64 exclusively magnificent job nintendo
<START> the movie is about a futuristic video game on a pod system that is almost like virtual reality the only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer jennifer jason leigh unless it can be repaired the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste the only way to repair the game however is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust jude law this movie was pretty good but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film the best thing about this film were the twists toward the end definitely worth seeing 7 10
<START> larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director but he has made some undeniably important films kids bully and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose shock revulsion and even disgust these films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth kids exposed us to the proliferation of a i d s and sexual promiscuity among the young bully touched upon similar issues ken park dealt somewhat ham handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui irrefutably all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth br br wassup rockers is about a group of poor hispanic from south central las angeles who go to arbitrarily go to beverly hills to skate that's it br br wassup rockers is nothing br br it has no substance it has an essentially nonexistent narrative and like kids it features a cast of first time actors who were drawn out of the films setting however unlike kids none of them have any semblance of talent there is better acting in porn this film features without a doubt the most terrible performances i've ever seen in a feature film one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the film making process but these kids are absolutely cringe worthy folks might i add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you'll ever hear my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater or you'll regret it afterward br br but then again it's not like they had much of a script to work with every line that is uttered is a contrived pathetically delivered and irritating beyond all measure the story itself is ludicrous it starts out reasonably enough but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity this begins of course with a capricious with a pair of rich white girls followed by a series of clichÃ©d national encounters characters being killed off for no reason and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti climax shots go on much longer than they need to be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight overlong lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets but then again with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible perhaps wassup rockers would have worked better as a short film br br anyways i could go on like this this is the worst film larry clark has made yet for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics look elsewhere this is by far the tamest film he's made yet and it's also the worst it's flat out horrible like uwe boll horrible definitely the worst one i saw at the festival br br 1 10
<START> what was bruce willis thinking when he signed on for this one this one made no sense to me i was so confused by it it wasnt funny at all i dont even know why disney made this one bruce is a great actor whom ive liked for a long time and this disappointed me a lot pass this one by on the video shelf
<START> a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by wolf blood into a meek quiet but very large gardener in order to prove an hypothesis so the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature island of dr moreau frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated goofy morality play br br though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best this film is not too poorly made and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time like most mad scientist films this is a weak warning against fooling around with mother nature it doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway the acting is passable as is the cinematography and the film moves along at an entertaining clip some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous but hey it's just a movie and a b minus one at that there are also a few nice shots of a wolf and a smattering of humor tossed in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously always a plus for this genre
<START> br br lets swap murders your wife my father seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers bruno anthony and guy haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey guy a solid respectable tennis player whose problem is that his wife the flirtatious miriam won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter anne laughs the whole conversation off as a joke the following week he isn't laughing any more in a scene of classic hitchcock suspense bruno stalks miriam through a carnival and strangles her as he does her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses cold hearted and amoral bruno his part of the deal completed approaches an appalled guy expecting even pressuring him into 'doing his bit ' matters are not helped when anne's precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting guy of murder so accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to commit another what is guy going to do the power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature and this hitchcock does to perfection
<START> no matter how much it hurts me to say this the movie is not as good as it could have been maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb but i expected so much more br br sure the idea is a good one the violent scenes and the camera work are outstanding the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking but the movie is soiled by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable first of all am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart with a different kind of music goblin during the needle scenes it would have been soooo intense instead the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension secondly the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired i don't want to say amateurish cause i love argento's movies the ending left me feeling empty talk about a final impression this is hardly what happens in most of films though admittedly suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale even if most of it is brilliant br br in short watch this movie try to make the most of its good points but be prepared for some bad ones as well this is not a perfect movie by any means
<START> i'm amazed that of all the reviews i've looked at nobody seems to have noticed one of the main points of this film or at least how i saw it it seems like one big homosexual fantasy camp clothing a glorified nude ferdinand a definite sexual tension between ariel and prospero and as a final climax a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the this whole approach once you get used to it provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images the sight of an innocent ariel being pulled towards a disgusting nude in order to perform her earthy and commands is one of the darkest i've ever scene in a shakespeare film however by the end of the film i'd grown tired of the style and the final dance was just too much to take still overall its an interesting interpretation of the play
<START> then the second half of this movie is hard to follow i got the first part with the spanish but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain the movie does little to fill you in on what happened and i don't remember much about it so the movie gets confusing then the movie begins when daughter of a rich merchant is accused of by the church specifically father lorenzo she is put to the question and forced to confess even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison her father forces lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp in hopes of getting released all it does is give a reason for the church to condemn lorenzo who runs off to france br br then the movie skips many years and the french revolution is in full force is released from prison it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help she tells him she had a child in prison goya sets up a meeting between her and lorenzo whom is now with the french and in power he is the father goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo whom decides it's best to send her off to america so no one will find out but before his plans get carried out the british join the and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted that part is not well told in the film it's like the film shows this to happen in a day br br final verdict the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the then the movie expects you to understand what is going on it just got too confusing to me then
<START> is the story only russians could tell about the second world war the largest front of the whole conflict has been ironically the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war while the western allies war effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner the east has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value br br there is no chance that could compete with band of brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind that the soldiers are russians is enough big reason to forgive the less eye captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is the most interesting so much different was the war in the eastern front and the nature of the russian army that you might wish people to produce more dramatizations from the other fronts and of armies br br is no way perfect but it has some rare specialties that augment the overall rating it tends to crush myths people have about the second world war the true heroes were russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only perish another great myth bust is that it presents the enemy who does not pick up his gun as an equal human being an advancement that has been difficult to try in many acclaimed films as well shows how the war in the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the isms grinds people into dust
<START> before watching this movie from beginning to end i happened to just catch the last half hour ordinarily i don't watch a movie if i haven't seen it from the beginning but a friend had it on and once i started watching it i couldn't stop br br i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release this is quite a funny movie often gallows humor and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing the monster makes leatherface look pretty and the monster truck is a like a cross between a world war i german artillery vehicle and a giant coffin br br a timid twenty five year old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married his ex best friend tags along and rags on him constantly they're menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck they also pick up a hitchhiker played by the very sexy aimee brooks br br i also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary and the electronic press kit and i found those both to be interesting i would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too but i have so many other movies to watch i've never seen before
<START> michael film kane' based on the character of the same name created by robert e howard is a disappointing fantasy action adventure film that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing poor characterisation and general dullness solomon kane james purefoy is a mercenary of queen elizabeth's army fighting in africa where he comes face to face with the devil's reaper Â a demon who collects the devil's debts i e souls Â refusing to go to hell just yet he evades the reaper and starts a new life in an english monastery with this new life solomon has left behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and instead now embraces the values of peace and non values but once he is expelled from the monastery due to the fear of the devil's reaper returning he must travel back to his home in devon and along the way he befriends a travelling family of puritans heading to the new world on their journey through the british the family is attacked and their daughter meredith rachel hurd wood is abducted by the evil sorcerer army which is lead on the front lines by the mysterious masked rider now a man of peace solomon must go back to his former life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction to save meredith br br despite having great source material to work from and build upon to create potentially an exciting and enduring medieval action adventure film the film fails in three key areas the pacing of this film is terrible which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short run time of only one hour and forty minutes and this is most likely a consequence of the fact that they wish to turn this film into a trilogy constantly jumping between of drama and self characterisation to that of action and muddy bloodshed somewhat kills the excitement of the action sequences instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats frothing with the eagle eyed anticipation the film instead feels incredibly subdued and this follows on the next piece of criticism dull despite being touted as an 'action adventure' film or in some circles an 'action epic' kane' is almost most certainly not the action is mundane and dull and is generally finished before you have the chance to admire the beauty of a decapitation finally aside from solomon himself there is very little characterisation within this film for example we know little and because of this care little about the young woman that sets out on his journey to save and i imagine again the filmmaker would refer this criticism to the fact that there is most likely going to be a second film which will hopefully touch upon these aspects that this film surely missed br br it isn't an entirely terrible film however james purefoy is gives a fantastic performance as solomon the mercenary who must decide whether or not to fall back on his conscience or his blade and how his decisions will impact not just upon himself but those around him as well while respect admiration and acknowledgement must also go to bassett and his crew as well for creating vivid locations that beautifully reflects the period in which they are filming at times it is hard not to get carried away with admiring the beauty of the locations shot composition and mise en scene at show here which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been placed into this film unfortunately however that is not to say the same for the story and characters at hand kane' certainly had the potential to be something more than simply an 'action epic ' however it seems that once again the lack of any real depth in the story and characters has resulted in michael bassett creating nothing more than a one dimensional look at swordplay during the medieval period
<START> certainly not a great show but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment it reminds of shows like married with children and roseanne as they go to places not traditionally dealt with in sitcoms it's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks but not rip roaring hilarious br br some of the characters are pretty funny the gay friend and some of the other drop ins this is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy sorry for the butchered spelling actually is effective and funny br br is this an all in the family or seinfeld type show absolutely not however it is certainly better than a show like 'til probably the worst tv show of any type out at the moment br br oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the hilary character is a little hottie
<START> this movie i saw it 15 years ago and in the last years couldn't remember it any more name or anything else just it was about a romanian country man played superbly by anthony quinn the impression i got from this drama will be eternal finally i found the name of the movie i hope i will be able to buy it and honestly this movie worth 10 oscars ten times bravo i was quite young when i first saw the movie i asked my friends if they heard about this story but nobody would know anything about anthony quinn playing the role of a romanian peasant i remember when a german officer came and saw anthony and told him he was a good breed but in fact the german was cheating on him for few bucks you won't get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it
