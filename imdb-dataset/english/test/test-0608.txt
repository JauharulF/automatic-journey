<START> this story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty one years as a boy i enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness books like call of the wild white fang the frontiersman and my side of the mountain influenced me tremendously i wanted so much to live like a mountain man but nothing inspired me more to do so than when i saw this movie on television in 1975 i wanted to be just like trapper however as i got older i found i was just too domesticated to live like that nonetheless i still romanticize about living that kind of life i agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in type movies but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story the true themes then i think you find yourself pleasantly touched i make it a point to watch this movie once a year after thirty one years i still get a chill running through me when i see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing haunting laugh of the trapper br br good luck old timer and stay free br br ps if you want to read more about the true story i found this link on the mad trapper of rat river br br http www com htm
<START> every movie quentin tarantino has made has become progressively worse i'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement but seeing as sic basterds sic has an 8 5 10 from over 100 000 ratings it doesn't seem like the general movie going public has any sense even his best work reservoir dogs wasn't a 'masterpiece ' the trouble is that claiming that you like tarantino's work has become trendy as soon as that happens you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon they will ignore laughably terrible acting and utterly self indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called everyone this movie is so terrible that i swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him like another reviewer has already said previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing i couldn't agree more this movie is nothing more than self indulgent and in joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play but thanks to the general movie going public i'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made bravo tarantino you've pulled off one of the best practical jokes of all time
<START> this movie is watchable but nothing special four girls on a road trip to vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker because he is cute they all end up staying the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere and the hitchhiker's psychotic issues with women become apparent br br the characters are clichÃ©s there is a married responsible woman a slutty party girl an unsure bride to be and a man hater who just got dumped the hitchhiker is genuinely nice until he goes crazy br br there's not nearly enough gore and way too much rape i enjoy slasher horror thrillers a lot and this one did nothing for me the ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie br br on the positive side the actors did a great job with that they had to work with the dialogue isn't awful and overall i was impressed with the cast having never seen or heard of any of them before and the plot wasn't out of the realm of possibility although i really doubt any woman in this day and age would pick up a hitchhiker no matter how attractive he is so i wasn't groaning that things didn't make sense br br overall the hitchhiker was well acted and made sense but wasn't very interesting there are a lot of better movies in the same genre that i would recommend over this one rest stop the devil's rejects texas chainsaw massacre even the hitcher remake do yourself a favor and skip it unless you don't have any other options
<START> this show just sucks i don't think i even need to say it or why because judging by the number of comments already i am just repeating everything keys to the vip is like turning on your tv and having it throw poo at you that is exactly what it is like i am not even exaggerating even a little bit these guys are so stupid not funny and not smooth with the ladies that it's not even funny its stupid i sat through four episodes and i want my two hours back where do they find the contestants because they are obviously deficient mentally if i was the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on tv i would do the world a favour and jump off the tallest building i could find how does garbage like this get on tv especially the comedy network shouldn't a show on something called the comedy network at least be a comedy show or maybe be funny so often
<START> 'the shining' has wit visual flair and an iconic performance by jack nicholson ' however has none of these things although it does borrow from its classic to wit a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife unlike stanley kubrick's great psychological horror film is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius it is magnificently comically awful it makes the spice girls movie look like a work of vital art is the tale of a family that moves to a gated community in the suburbs all is to be well with the world they will live in peace and they will calmly go about their business away from those mean old city streets but no character julia starts getting spooked by those things that insist on going bump in the night by empty supermarkets and doors that close themselves and her husband samuel played by jordi molla switches in an instant from laid back family man to wild eyed permanently unshaven nutter injecting julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden molla much respected as an actor is absolutely dreadful in this comic rather than menacing he simply cannot pull off a threatening expression he just come across as a barroom slime ball who's had one drink too many so is there anything to redeem this film no the script is clunky the plot non existent and the cast without merit completely without tension and full of be scared now moments is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller it is ridiculous and overblown but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of recent years it's well worth a watch
<START> this was an interesting adaption of william shakespeare's last known solo play but in my humble opinion a terrible one jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start he makes miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long prospero is no different a mix of madness and self pity on his part i could not imagine shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way jarman portraits them br br caliban's appearance is maybe the only thing he got right but then again i was under the impression that was a tormented deformed monster but turns out to be an insane rambling who is constantly cackling not as i would have imagined him ferdinand makes a brief appearance naked most the time and quiet br br in fact to the point i stopped watching this awful adaption their had been so many lines cut from the play if anything i think jarman was trying to re write shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time so much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a shakespeare play but a load of 70's melodramatic preposterous rubbish br br an attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be
<START> river queen attempts to pack a complicated sweeping historical narrative into just under two hours there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the scenery is beautifully captured however the film did suffer from some poor leads samantha morton sarah especially came across as unconvincing there seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong determined character with a clear view of her destiny kiefer sutherland's character private doyle seemed to be pointless and for the most part unintelligible irish brogue needs a little polishing on the other hand cliff curtis morrison and as sarah's son boy were well rounded and believable br br the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up e g how on earth did know how to find sarah and doyle no explanation and very unsatisfying br br i did go to this movie with an open mind i hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing
<START> what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr doing in this light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools while the topic is one that needs to be addressed the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick the characters are cutouts from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the faculty watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14 with them it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems for anyone older it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning as i did recently on bravo matter of fact what was this doing on bravo
<START> renting this direct to video film i was not expecting an amazing piece of cinematography not to say just because a film is in cinema it will only very loosely following the story retold in the epic poem this film provides a unique take on the tale of monsters and super humans the general photography can be summarized as conflicted with its mixture of mediaeval and post apocalyptic reminiscent of mad max with a rock and techno soundtrack to boot one comes away feeling a bit off the fight scenes though unbelievable are entertaining and christopher lambert possesses some of the most interesting weapon combinations i have ever seen on film though often a tad unfathomably inefficient the special effects used for the monster grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights br br christopher lambert delivers an average performance as beowulf it will be nowhere near as memorable as highlander but at least it wasn't as poor as fortress the supporting cast is rather neutral br br if you're looking for a good action adventure story with a complex and engaging plot i would not suggest this film however if you want a flick that is of little substance full of campy battle scenes and a somewhat predictable plot find a copy of this
<START> sorry this was a woeful excuse for a film a plot line so holey it resembled a block of swiss cheese and a butch of characters who seemed to me to be utterly devoid of inter personal relations well except of course for carlyle and lee miller who i could have sworn were meant to be in love unlike the union of tyler and miller who were for the most part like the rest of the film utterly unconvincing although the end product was and amusing for all the wrong reasons the production values were high and deserve some acknowledgement but unfortunately the end result was rubbish what was everyone involved thinking they definitely should have packed up early on this one
<START> this kind of angst can only be inside a young person who seeks very seriously his religion and his place in this world as the text in the beginning of the movie says these pictures are dead they are the past already and have been right from the moment when the product was ready but that is only for the maker of these products maybe to somebody who is in the same frame of mind i think very many people at least of those who are seriously interested in religion go through the same terrible and doubts in their personal development and that of course is the reason that art is made in the first place identification and consolation amongst fellow human beings br br this film uses very well the classic of the experimental cinema and this is where those are to my opinion in the best possible use as an instrument in telling stories and creating atmosphere to them not just as a pure abstractions or as an end in those tricks have already been made many enough times some other movies that i imagine have influenced inspired this director are eraserhead and nosferatu it's interesting how these make this movie totally timeless there is nothing contemporary in this movie or nothing from any other specific time either it could have been made a thousand years ago br br it is interesting in this story how these people treat this new born holy child they use it selfishly in their own purposes and don't even try to listen to him they beat him rip off his intestines and castrate him they drag his living body forcibly from place to place and they do the same kind of violence to his mother the story also reminds me of the borges' short story el de brodie also the critique towards the practices of the christian institutions reminds me of the great el topo br br unpleasant watch at times but beautiful very simple thought and concentrated very strong movie almost too strong the whole human energy has been concentrated to this also this movie shows that when you have the passion and ideas you can make a movie with a round zero budget br br but i have to admit it was a bit hard to watch for a contemporary viewer like myself because of the it was so slow and demanding but after all worth the suffering i have to give ten points just for the effort that somebody makes this kind of movie
<START> first off i want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things br br this movie is shot just like the tv show with a lot of short clips compiled into one long movie some of the scenes don't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny the only negative i had is i felt like i wasted money on my popcorn and there was no way i could eat or drink anything during this movie i was constantly laughing i was honestly nervous of drinking some and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere br br if you don't mind some male nudity and you enjoy jackass the movie jackass the tv show and viva la bam then for your sake go see this movie br br and if you don't like the first movie or the tv show don't see it and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it hardcore christians who see this and bash it just doesn't seem right to me
<START> tomorrow is another day is not the sequel to gone with the wind but a lovers on the lam story and a surprisingly alert and moving one as well for a supposed hack relegated to b minus features like the devil thumbs a ride felix feist proves adept at filling his work with unexpected inventive details steve cochran leaves prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13 and now he's still a tentative gawky pubescent operating inside a man's frame lonesome he visits a 10 cents a dance palace and falls for brassy grasping ruth roman but the sudden shooting of her police bigwig boyfriend causes the ill matched couple to hit the road ending like the joads in a california migrant worker camp br br roman's the revelation in her best known role as farley granger's fiancee in hitchcock's strangers on a train she was ill and under used here she persuasively from bottle blonde taxi dancer to sacrificing wife and mother to be and a brunette to boot almost as good waffling between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an under socialized male and the ending while unconvincing is nonetheless welcome along with they live by night and gun crazy tomorrow is another day displays a redeeming sweetness and warmth that belie its film noir pedigree
<START> i just saw this movie at the tribeca film festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing the combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile the movie was about a seventeen year old boy whose mother and father are very religious the seventeen year old ben decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life it is very comical and touching i honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone if you didn't catch one of the showings at the film festival it's supposed to come out in theaters later in the year please go see it it is a great film
<START> what some hollywood movies try and practically never succeed creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons without becoming unrealistic manages this beautiful movie perfectly well resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'la double vie de of the same director and with the same beautiful actress this is a real movie that changes perspective of life a little bit intelligent and beautiful story masterfully directed excellent main actors masterful cinematography i've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time and i still think it's one of the best i've ever seen and if you should be unhappy with the ending of 'white' 'red' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy
