<START> while amiable and amusing for gay audiences frank oz's film in and out about a closeted gay teacher who has been on national television by a former student has been sanitized and to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that the bird cage although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film the movie revolves around kevin kline's howard brackett who is a grossly stereotyped gay man the movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music revel in barbra streisand movies and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation like queer eye the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly dim witted and lacking in taste and culture ok so in and out is only a comedy but even comedies send messages that can hurt br br unfortunately at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character howard is middle aged deeply closeted or in self denial and evidently has never had a sex life a three year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets long talks and watching funny lady fortunately joan cusack plays howard's intended emily montgomery and she steals the show throughout most of the film's funniest moments belong to her although kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious he is a gifted physical performer but the film gives him only few moments to shine matt dillon also stands out as the student turned actor and the clip from his oscar nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical however despite the movie's gay theme there is no boy meets boy romance and only one male to male kiss and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between michael and fredo corleone in godfather ii br br although well intentioned in and out fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials yet little outrage is expressed most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about howard's self realization which seems to take place overnight and his abrupt and unjust dismissal not surprisingly howard's parents endearingly portrayed by debbie reynolds and wilford brimley and his students rise to support him however the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to howard brackett in the film the movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob was a rabid fan of football drove a station wagon listened to country music and lived on fast food despite some good performances and funny situations in and out perpetuates stereotypes and whether they be positive or negative stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history
<START> throw momma from the train is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs br br billy crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse danny devito plays a man in one of crystal's writing classes crystal's ex wife is a hag to put it nicely and crystal hates her devito sensing this offers crystal a deal one night devito will kill crystal's wife if crystal kills devito's nag of a mother crystal does of course refuse but later corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes and so as things play out we see what happens when you try to throw someone's momma from a moving train br br this story is an interesting character study a story of evil greed revenge ego trust doing what's right but most of all corruption we see crystal's white collar writer become ever stressed with events colliding around him and because of devito's constant nagging he says yes but we know deep down in his subconscious he wanted to say yes and he's pleased that he said it to devito br br this movie is a bit of a dark spoof on hitchcock's immortal film strangers on a train and it plays an homage to the film early on when there is a theater playing strangers on a train we see devito watching the movie and a in his head pops on he gets an idea throw momma from the train br br billy crystal gives another convincing and strangely comical performance as a hassled writer on the verge of collapse he has been so beaten down by everything around him that his inner emotions come out and he agrees to throw devito's momma from the train br br danny devito directed this film excellently he uses just the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and sickness everything is demented but not to an extreme like in some other dark comedies it has just the right touch of darkness that shone through in the war of the roses br br not only is throw momma from the train a simple tale of corruption and morality but is also an interesting character study definitely worth catching on tv br br 3 5 5 stars br br john ulmer
<START> this much anticipated dvd memento of rush's visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc the picture and sound production values are amazing even more so as they constantly battled the elements to bring this production off all the tracks you would expect from the rush catalogue are here from tom sawyer to the pass gloriously reproduced for the frankly brazilian crowd they actually to which is an instrumental and gives you an indication of their fervour the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set pieces la villa and the awesome drum solo plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy
<START> i don't understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment the eye popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated me and my girlfriend just watched it together and i'm not sure we'll ever be able to have sex again i'm not sure what was worse the scrawny unattractive cast their supremely genitals the rancid attempts at humor the screeching noises that claimed to be songs br br no i know what was worst of all the girls in the green leotards with green licking alice to dry her off then proposing in broken childlike speech that they suckle milk from her breasts that was the worst br br also what was with the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas why are all the male actors gay why does humpty dumpty a dildo in the air and pretend that it's his penis why did my eyes have to see this there are no words
<START> this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his piranhas any since 1978 90 of the special effects are lifted from piranha 1978 up from the depths 1979 and humanoids from the deep 1979 it makes piranha ii the spawning look like it belongs on the american film institute list
<START> i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller it is anything but thrilling br br most of the time you hear piano sounds then you hear piano sounds then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybody br br then again piano sounds br br to be honest this movie was the reason for me to register at imdb because i think this movie is one of those which humankind has to be warned of br br spoiler by the way the most action like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled br br also very interesting the actors yes the quotes are intentional as you can think because they do not act they play piano and do smalltalk but it's not acting they do br br i think before this movie i never left a cinema and felt angry really this film made me angry angry for the time and money i spent on it
<START> well where do we start there was a lot of potential for this film with such big stars playing a role but the whole story was ruined by a horrific plot this movie did not pan out to be what i would expect the good guy makes it out alive i mean co mon nobody wants the good guy to be successful the ending was cringe worthy and very clichÃ© no thought what so ever you got the plot all wrong the bad guys are meant to come out successful br br if you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spend it doing something else this movie was the epitome of crap i really think the actors did this movie for some quick vegas cash no doubt about it save your money watch a better movie
<START> some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise this film is horrible br br william shatner's character harvey is an amateur screenwriter he's also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters grovel maybe they do br br the film's setup is way too long we don't get to the point of the story until well into the second half the first half darts and among assorted characters br br shoot or be shot is touted as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people they're all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane br br i can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate for money he used to be a respected actor what happened br br even though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a put down of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasn't the intent but that's certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written
<START> i just witnessed a movie that by all rights should have been fodder for a second rate mow on lifetime but trust the irish to keep it from being anything but saccharine the set up all but screams here's a message concerning what's truly important in life but the execution was way into the let's see just what we can get away with here br br it helps to have two fantastic actors in the leads james mcavoy as rory and stephen robertson as michael while rory is offered up as the near saintly one never mind the language and attitude he's the life force in this piece and could easily have been insufferable in his ultimately caring attitude mcavoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet but the revelation is stephen robertson as michael not since leonardo di caprio in gilbert grape has anyone so perfectly captured a person with an affliction that i began to believe he really was an actor with cerebral palsy and his eyes my god he can rip you apart with them br br this movie is to paraphrase rory f n' amazing go see it take a box of kleenex and enjoy every well earned tear and laugh
<START> this movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes i don't know what everyone else was smoking calling this a beatiful film i feel that a couple hours of my life were stolen from me and i want them back i would put this in the category of a battlefield earth yes folks it is that bad you would do just as well to watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over it would have the same effect do not waste your time
<START> my poor tank girl they ignored everything great about you why does it have as little to do with the comics as possible i would have loved a movie that followed the plot or at least had the characters right br br why was tank girl american she's austrailian dammit and she's not living in a post apocalyptic war zone either she lives in the outback with like a savage she does it because she wants to live that way not because she has to because malcolm mc is acting the git and why's she looking after those kids the only children in the comics end up violently being choked by her it's terrible that they made her into a lame mother figure br br and my poor jet girl and sub girl in the comics jet is a sarcastic wisecracker and sub girl is another sarcastic wisecracker with a weird sense of humour in the movie jet is this mousy little thing and sub is this ditzy middle aged hag and doesn't look or act anything like what he's meant to be either though maybe hot roo human love was too much for the usa box office the humour was so lame too whatever happened to all the stuff about the smiths and that brilliant slang they used all the time what sort of line is will this take long i don't wanna miss baywatch even programmes for tiny children can come up with better material than that
<START> having known and loved this book since i was eleven i was terrified to see it coming up as a movie what if they'd made a dreadful mess of it in the event i needn't have worried at all everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison which to me added nothing at all however it really is the most beautiful love story and i'm so glad i it so i can watch it again and again my only gripe is why didn't they give a green 'which made him such a personable man' such a simple thing when they went to so much trouble for everything else if you get the chance see this it is excellent
<START> i hadn't heard of soap girl but i saw a poster with a five star review from film threat outside the theater so i figured how bad could it be well i soon found out my god this film was awful the most wooden acting i have ever seen outside of a porn flick absolutely agonizing dialogue i just can't understand how this was made and why anyone agreed to be a part of it and i find it completely unfathomable that this was actually being shown in a theater and money was being charged to see it how did this happen and most importantly what the was the guy from film threat thinking
<START> i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night into woods that scared her in the daytime this movie was pretty good had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically but still manage to get into danger it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots for the director to get closure in ending this film br br atmosphere was great scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me i live in a wooded area so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten
<START> finally a true horror movie this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off i have to admit that i didn't want to see this movie my 17 year old dragged me to it but am very glad i did during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw first one michael myers and jason and no cgi crap
