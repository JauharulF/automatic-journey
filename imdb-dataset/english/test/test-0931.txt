<START> what makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when every once in a while when you least expect it a film like the cell comes along and knocks your socks off this movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special affects the acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while it is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation so a lot of credit must go to mark the writer 9 out of 10
<START> it's pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made too bad you would have been watching it alone probably the reason you hate it no game keys to the vip is hilarious light and funny guys are going to eat this show up my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show the chicks were and the clubs kicked ass i'll be watching every week it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren't being made now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television
<START> the capture of bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time i love sasquatch and bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one's time terrible terrible terrible i watched this movie last night and it was all i could do to finish watching i understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture bigfoot but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie it did have some amusing parts though there was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie i think the director was trying to fill time the worst thing was the way the bigfoot looked the obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur bigfoot it was laughable if you want to see a very bad bigfoot movie then i suggest that you purchase this movie personally i wasted my time and my money on this one
<START> this was a very nice concert by the one and only mj the choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent the vocals were okay i have to admit that his vocals were crap on human nature and billie jean you couldn't hear him half the time the other songs make up for the singing the highlights of the show are jam smooth criminal i just can't stop loving you she's out of my life thriller billie jean the dancing not the singing black or white man in the mirror the concert was almost perfect if it was anybody but mj it would have been a 9 it is a must see i wish i was born then so i could have gotten a ticket to the best concert of 1992
<START> look this movie is obscure brilliant and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary i suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin nevertheless we could only pray for the chance to see this one on dvd i would say that it even beats the great if you like a dark movie with plenty of spooky imagery look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be
<START> i admit i go more for the traditional vampire tale but this one is a real winner lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours there was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world a good one for all us vampire lovers
<START> this is a docu drama of mostly the later years of life with nearly all the parts played by actors but spot which tv plays himself it was made for the arts channel but my guess is there will be syndication and dvd releases soon is ably played by the excellent michael sheen here repeating his previous stage role with great success most of the supporting cast are also very good and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors this is not however light viewing anyone familiar with diaries and general unhappy demeanour will already know how twisted he could be in later life so don't expect 80 minutes of carry on styled buffoonery since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout recommended but it's tragi comic indeed
<START> leon errol handles his double role of uncle matt lindsay and lord basil superbly but i have trouble liking the mexican spitfire series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities and these are telegraphed way in advance errol is funny as the stuffy lord but i would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition br br
<START> this was touted as a sequel to crash dive which was a very good film in the low budget category i assumed this movie would be good also but boy was i wrong first this movie has nothing to do with crash dive other than they both take place on submarines secondly the plot can be slow tedious and in some cases totally preposterous br br this movie will not hold most people's attention i remember reading a book during the slow boring scenes there will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud the corkscrew scene is definitely one after i got over my initial shock that anyone would slip this in and not know people would not only disbelieve it but laugh at the sheer silliness of it i was able to find humor in it br br if you want to see md in a good sub flick watch crash dive and leave this lame film on the shelf
<START> i happened across this movie while channel surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly made christian film about the end times which i find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously to be fair i only saw the last 30 minutes so i missed the part about ufos and the sci fi stuff but it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the christian faith as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense br br as a film the script was terrible the acting was mediocre and the pacing was poor the cinematography and direction were sub par no interesting visuals no layered plot line no creativity don't just blame it on the budget films can still be interesting without special effects this wasn't christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message and the message here was hardly christian br br disclaimer the rest of this comment is targeted towards christians br br first off it is unethical in any business to bait and switch your customers i don't like being told i can win a free ipod only to realize i have to spend 300 at participating stores first don't like being told they're watching a sci fi film and then get bombarded with christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer hidden agendas don't win you any friends much less converts br br secondly you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true the actors who represented christians came off as callous smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing representational dialogue turn to jesus or go to hell fine don't believe me but you'll be sorry the day you die i can guarantee you'll wish you paid more attention to this jesus stuff when you land in the belly of hell ok i may be exaggerating but it certainly came off in the same manner if you think this is a clear message for christ you're wrong i don't recall jesus using threats and and i don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear so christians please don't use this as a witnessing tool for your unsaved friends it is heavy handed offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true christian message br br thirdly the theology was bad apart from characterizing jesus as a means of hell insurance it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether ufos or alien life could exist instead it offered one pat answer ufos are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most christians as the bible doesn't mention ufos or aliens you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other the rapture isn't necessarily even a widely accepted sound biblical concept though nowadays most evangelical christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series if you do your research as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting the idea of two comings of christ the first as the rapture is a relatively new phenomena in church tradition popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century the majority of orthodox christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported br br basically this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of christianity and its beliefs i wouldn't recommend it
<START> you gotta love the spaghetti western universe the vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme close ups and the anti hero walks away from the girl in the end a lot of people call films 'depressing' i find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go i think bleak and unforgiving are more apt mostly because 'depressing' suggests a level of sentimentality almost every director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad strokes br br gli must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the sergio corbucci canon it's a beautiful movie and it makes sense that corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with companeros after the unremitting one two punch of the great silence and this although he would later revert back to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed sonny and jed there's still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall grimness of the movie imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble and it hurts to have mario playing mexican one handed bandit el diablo as over the top as he always plays his characters br br those minor gripes aside there's more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado shootouts galore the population of an entire town reduced to crawling naked in the dirt the typical iconic of the laconic antihero played by johnny halliday the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the movie corbucci might never receive the acclaim of the more famous sergio or the american of the genre but you and i know that's a gross injustice for a very talented director his dynamic shot selection in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and receding in the background his flair for quick pacing and feverish energy in moving a story that wasn't always all that along the way he photographs open spaces everything in his work makes me sure that if corbucci was american and had emerged 15 years later along with mann and hawks the cahiers du cinema critics would have lauded him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration
<START> what on earth happened to rgv there are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start first and worst the music every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood quite pathetically i might add secondly the lighting do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working and finally if you are going to the godfather and godfather 2 please realize that a lot of us have seen in was a ripoff of but better done and more entertaining i have seen a similarity in both company and sarkar and while rgv's ab tak 56 was brilliant these two movies leave something to be desired people will not be impressed any more by just corrupt politicians and the lot maybe rgv should see which is good enough to be rgv
<START> watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine Â it's sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure it's the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation he's very good in a small role as pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie
<START> having spent all of her money caring for her terminally ill spouse recently widowed karen lori moves with her two daughters sarah scout taylor compton and emma chloe to her late husband's run down family home in rural pennsylvania where local legends speak of zombies who roam the woods at night br br just seeing the names of this film's writer and director in the opening credits was enough to send shivers up my spine boaz davidson is the responsible for penning the scripts for such stv titles as octopus 1 2 spiders and crocodile whilst j s cardone gave us the godawful 'video nasty' the slayer and dull vampire flick the forsaken with such dubious talent responsible i didn't expect much from wicked little things br br and having just finished the film i'm glad i kept my expectations low br br although the movie looks good at times with lovely use of the eerie woodland locale and the cast give reasonable performances given the clichÃ©d drivel that they are working with the plot is so laboured poorly written and derivative that it's impossible to be enthusiastic about most importantly perhaps the film's killers undead children who rise each night from the mine in which they died aren't in the least bit scary a smudge of makeup black contacts and some crappy joke shop scars doing very little to add to the sense of menace scout taylor compton and company do their best to look afraid of the tiny terrors screaming convincingly with every confrontation but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience is to little avail the little just ain't got what it takes to chill the blood br br there are a few lacklustre zombie chow scenes in a futile bid to win over gore hounds and the final kill which sees the victim's blood both compton and is suitably tasteless but on the whole wicked little things aka zombies in the uk is instantly forgettable another clunker in the filmographies of cardone and davidson
<START> this movie tries to be artistic but comes across as puerile as a film school student's first attempt next it tries to be erotic but comes across as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt lastly it tries to be cruel gripping but aside from kinski's performance which is powerful but conspicuously misplaced amidst the amateur melodrama it's about as gripping as your hand around a wet noodle which is an appropriate metaphor considering how un erotic this film is it features a blowjob scene which is even lamer than career burying performance in the brown bunny run away now while you have the chance go find yourself a victoria's secret lingerie catalogue instead it's more artistic and more erotic than this tripe
