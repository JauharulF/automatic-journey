<START> at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece set in the early 60's complete with a flawless motown soundtrack but there's so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it the cast of unknowns at the time is excellent and it is notable as an all black cast film that doesn't fall into any clichÃ©s at times cooley high almost feels like an updated urban neo realist film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well there's a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar minded films like later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warm hearted but also true to life this might be one of the sleepers of the 70s celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss this is a fine fine film br br the bare bones pan and scan dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little cared for this excellent film is
<START> zen and the art of written and directed by david is a short film about a young man named david his friends call him zen and what transpires in one strange day of his life zen works as a for an upper middle class family the lady of the house tries to get zen to help her cheat on her husband unfortunately her son walks in on them instead of her husband from this point on the movie starts to speed through many revelations between the characters along with the eventual involvement of the man of the house zen and the art of landscaping is witty smart and overall very well written the comedic timing of the actors is also very strong it's a fun light movie that i would strongly recommend
<START> rudolph film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's dexter cornell dennis quaid is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage the initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned we are not that surprised unless of course you are familiar with the original dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students sydney fuller meg ryan but they find they have many obstacles in their way br br the film begins promisingly in black and white as dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder his own but the huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad its only a question of how bad sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium but now the film resorts to full technicolor there are some brief homages to noir as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind but there's really nothing here to recommend it the performances are awful ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine the film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded into an already fine movie premise obviously trying to cash in one the body heat audience the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure they are welcome to it 4 10
<START> seeing the names of the starring actors statham snipes and phillippe i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting instead all i got from it was not just boring 92 minutes but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame and shabby bad cop phrases br br the main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to begin with and when you have that than no one can help you not statham not wesley snipes not even john mcclane could save this movie it could be cool for the kids if they aren't over 12 years of age because they don't care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie
<START> i just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century i got what i had expected and so much more just to think i came across this movie by luck before i had never even heard of it it's a german film made in 1993 so i suppose i can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern american audience it's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film i dare say that its as good if not better then platoon full metal jacket apocalypse now and all quiet on the western front all of which are iconic war movies br br 1942 world war ii is in full swing nazi germany has over run mainland europe and parts of north africa then adolf hitler orders the full scale invasion of the soviet union a fateful move that ultimately dooms nazi germany to defeat in the early stages the invasion goes well and the german armies conquer large sections of soviet territory but a critical battle ensues at stalingrad a city that hold great symbolic strategic value the battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions a nightmare for both the german russian soldiers fighting on the verge of taking the city the germans are suddenly counter attacked by the russians who end up cutting off the entire german 6th army inside stalingrad to make matters worse the russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the germans this entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young german soldiers fighting for survival not only against the russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about medals glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier br br this film is going to haunt me for a while the german soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive then their humanity sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic nazi's often portrayed in film everything they were fighting for is no longer important and everything they believed in was shattered and after fighting a gruesome battle against the russians inside stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of winter causing many to freeze to death the battle winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real it's amazing in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything after witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on it was really sad when there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death which is just another one of hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the russians br br a good anti war film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does the battle for the tractor factory sequence is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth but that's really what the battle for stalingrad was like the german russian soldiers were depicted with humanity it was only the bad apples specifically on the german side that doomed the men bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically emotionally during war we all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time what the average foot soldier endured at stalingrad was beyond imagination even if they had survived everything they had seen done would have scarred them for life br br stalingrad shows us why war is hell and what exactly hell looks like
<START> this film was just on two nights running on itv1 dear oh dear someone actually bought this on the strength of robert ok i missed the start but what i did see was so bad i thought no i watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it nothing was based on reality i doubt things would progress as they did in this film everything was poor about this film ok cgi but no reality the write up gave the impression of a cliff hanger end sorry i wasn't impressed yes formulaic couldn't guess the end from what i saw the military had the upper hand people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing it just wouldn't have happened that way it was worse than leave your brain at the door it was annoying as someone else said yeah right of course that would have happened not the credits mentioned quebec and canada so it was a co production missed the third party concerned i'll have to check back on this site i'm not usually this critical but this annoyed me
<START> based on the 2007 spy novel by david ignatius body of lies tells the story of a cia operative roger ferris dicaprio who is sent to jordan to track down an al qaeda mastermind all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his jordanian hosts and his manipulative american boss ed hoffman crowe br br anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double agent action and the betrayal of ferris by hoffman but the actual story is much more mundane instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy american ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of amman jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals only during a scene where ferris takes his new found iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from jordanian men br br compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding ferris flies to jordan ferris gets expelled from jordan ferris flies to washington ferris flies to the uk ferris flies back to jordan hoffman flies to jordan hoffman returns home to take care of his kids Â an on it goes this is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of the amazing race not a spy thriller br br in body punishing loyalty to his craft crowe gained an impressive 63 pounds of for the role of portly ed hoffman thus joining the small select club of actors consisting of robert de niro and christian bale as thespians who've subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub par mess
<START> now this movie is the worst i have ever seen it is simply a disaster i think it's really a sick movie i just wasted my time watching this cheap crap i can't believe anyone would produce such a disaster such a waste of money and time nothing to learn from this movie it's just a hollow sick evil flick i don't think they could've make it worse this movie just earned it's title as the king of lowest crap the acting is a disaster the meaning oh well there is no meaning just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the suffering child in the end of the movie and the killing of the wife which again was another dumb blow to this movie do yourself a favor if you actually have some self respect keep away from this awfulness
<START> a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television indecent proposal br br indecent two protagonists david and diane murphy are played woody harrelson and demi moore i'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me love affection playfulness attraction Â none of these materialized on screen in their interactions together br br since i knew that eventually robert redford would show up it was clear from the beginning that the good part the meat of the movie would be the scenes between him and demi moore poor woody harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film he seemed to be holding back preoccupied with his receding hairline br br ok so fast forward what idiots these two diane and david are for thinking they can win back the 50 000 they owe by gambling no acting faux pas there just hideously bad lazy unforgivable writing of course they lose all their money surprised i know i wasn't enter robert redford john gage in the film Â a romantic perhaps emotionally frigid man an updated gatsby a very good role and though not a great great actor next to those two redford looks like olivier he immediately falls in love and lust with diane and we the viewers for once feel it this is how to love a woman not david's way trading gum mouth to mouth with diane on a slimy pier did i see that right as gage redford wears a suit and tie in every scene yes it's meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a rich man but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it other wardrobe symbolism includes david's now ironed shirts at the end of the film signifying resolve getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearing br br and what is it with california garden parties as depicted in hollywood movies suddenly everyone appears british complete with lacy dresses three piece suits for the men hats hats and of course the parasol yes diane her transformation to rich man's fiancÃ©e now complete is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol though she insisted that she couldn't be bought she succumbed at last to the sexual tension here is where the film branches off into pure americana i mean of course david and diane will end up together my question is why diane was bored with david why not let her ride the robert redford wave and i mean for a good long while how can she pull herself out of the sexual romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because woody harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party sits himself down and looks demi moore in the eyes that's just not how it goes he was so weak br br but we must have our happy ending we have to swallow the moral lesson we're not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise director lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juvie set the br br in addition to garden parties in which there's nary an suv tee shirt or baseball cap in sight such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects far flung california cities and how else to symbolize the return to middle class or working class life
<START> this film made me so angry because of its stupidity that i felt the need to create an account on imdb to share with you my opinion i liked ashton kutcher in a lot like love and this is why i still wanted to see this film despite it's current 4 2 rating it is highly over rated i trusted that an actor any of them would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such low now quality production it is very disappointing the theme of home sitting was much better used in deuce bigalow male gigolo things that did not make sense here fist of all the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who doesn't know anything about taking care of it secondly the rule is not to let anybody in the house but the house sitter fails to follow this simple rule the door is not locked and so on
<START> talk about false advertising i wasted an hour and twenty five minutes watching this piece of crap and there was not one leisure suit not one platform shoe no pointy finger dancing and not a single disco ball i watched it on a saturday night and ended up with an awful fever but it had nothing to do with the music br br seriously with or without john travolta this movie sucked br br from the opening scene you will be asking yourself the question where did that rope come from and will it please hang me too from its unabashed bias against the driving abilities of the pennsylvania dutch to the shameless promotion of the apparently everlasting capacities of laptop batteries to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from japanese cinema this is the worst film to hit theaters since the grudge
<START> eisenstein describes his collaboration with as an equal partnership where they worked together to match image and music scene by scene unfortunately the sound recording was a disaster so for once the devotion to authenticity in criterion dvd's backfires fortunately there is at least one restored version of the film on vhs classics with an excellent re recording of the music by the st petersburg philharmonic orchestra and chorus br br it is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in england germany and the united states eisenstein's film was made in 1938 in response to the fear of a german invasion and olivier's in 1943 when a german invasion of england was still expected both films are stagey but in different ways olivier begins by showing a staged performance of the play in the globe theater by shakespeare's own company then takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic though still stylized setting eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning but the dialog and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old russian theater this works very well for speeches as alexander because part of his job as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public br br in nazi germany the first major propaganda film was leni riefenstahl's tedious triumph of the will which recorded a huge political spectacle crowds cheering hitler's ranting speeches the propaganda in her masterpiece the film of the 1936 berlin olympics is much subtler with its worship of the athletic male body carrying disturbing undertones of the aryan superiority myth but wartime german propaganda films could also be subtle karl ritter's furlough on word of honor is typical it shows a young lieutenant letting the men in his company go on a 24 hour leave before returning to the wwi trenches and almost certain death against the advice of veterans he accepts their word of honor to return though he will be and shot if they don't naturally they all return though some of them berate themselves for it presumably inspiring the audiences to similar displays of duty to their country br br in the united states one of the better wwii propaganda films was howard hawks' air force in it we follow the mismatched crew of a bomber as they bond to each other with the experience of battle and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war typically for hawks' films however their real loyalty is more to each other than to their country br br eisenstein has to reach far back in history to find any russian military triumphs ironically alexander like the other russian princes is descended from the vikings who sailed up the russian rivers to conquer and rule their own fiefdoms so he is a conquerer repelling another would be conquerer physically they are not that different though the actors portraying the german princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and smirking stupidity but the real contrast is between the common soldiers the russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles whereas the german peasants who scuttle out of the shield wall to kill wounded russians are a foot shorter than their masters there is some historical truth in this contrast russian in the middle ages were much better off than their european counterparts because they could always escape into the wilderness and clear their own land br br eisenstein's film also cleverly gives us our first sight of alexander as a fisherman in the battle with the germans he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them when breaks the shield wall they are forced to regroup and mass on the west side of the lake where the ice is thinner br br one of the other pleasures of eisenstein's film which most audiences miss is the historically accurate way that he portrays the politics of medieval russia cities like and owed their growing wealth and prominence largely to trade which put the merchants into power and sidelined the princes until their military expertise and feudal were needed to repel invaders in the film alexander is shown not only as a military leader but also as a master politician who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory
<START> the joy and tragedy of the christmas season lies in the fact that it mostly revolves around family that is why some people call it the children's holiday as we age natural and progress removes the people and the things that gave us our special memories john denver in one of his sweetest roles plays george billings a successful nyc architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier his life is focused around his 9 year old daughter alex both are still grieving their loss george is trying his best to make this a special christmas for his daughter enter his boss thomas renfield played by the wonderful col flagg of m a s h guy edward winters who sends george to georgetown co to explore a possible real estate deal lying to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a vacation rather than work george and alex fly into town where they're immediately met by a collection of loving generous but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose main eccentricity is that they all believe in santa claus georgetown is a picture book community we'd all love to live in and we'd love the people for neighbors george soon meets a love interest in susan jane were it not for the grinch renfield it would be an ideal time but the fact is he is in town to find property for renfield to develop and there is a nice ranch near town about to be foreclosed and the dark edges of the movie revolve around the impending foreclosure and the reactions of the townies the rancher and the outsiders i won't spoil the ending for those who've never seen the movie it's a typical happy christmas ending but it's handled in a fairly subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy all in all this is a most pleasant way to spend a couple of your christmas tv hours john denver and jane have nice chemistry and james as alex does a real nice job i've always loved the work of mary wickes a recognizable character actress and all of the other cast members do a nice job with less meaty parts this is a regular christmas fare for my family i rate it 4 5
<START> i felt as though the two hours i spent watching this film may have been better served by perhaps going to the local used bookstore and looking for old fashion magazines and halston ads or perhaps by watching paint dry those two would have at least engaged my mind a bit more than india song the most frustrating part of sitting through this was that i could see what moods atmospheres were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been fleshed out more instead what happened was a presentation of an incoherent silly chain of with the same scenes rehashed over and over to beat some sort of point into our senses br br i was loathe to devote more time to this film by writing any sort of review except to perhaps warn other folks against this waste of time
<START> movie about two australian girls debbie nell schofield and sue sue knight and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys br br i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981 technically i was still a teenager i was 19 so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted script wise there's nothing new here it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating sex suicide etc etc i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored what i found interesting was despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair these teenagers aren't much different than american teens they had many of the same difficulties and hang ups also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well made and pretty interesting so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids i give it a 7
