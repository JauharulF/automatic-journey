<START> most of this political thriller presented as a mostly run of the mill movie with a somewhat better development of many of the major characters that was much appreciated until the big twist and powerful climax that recalled twists experienced in silence of the lambs or the sixth sense reese witherspoon as the distraught wife of the missing egyptian husband and as the strong armed interrogator offer strong performances jake gyllenhaal unfortunately is handed a more two dimensional character and has to struggled with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn cia analyst that has been presented many times before in other movies early on there is the nice scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of saving private ryan the silent scene that was used so effectively in reflecting one consequence of violence the script also provides a little more glimpse into the mind set of the enemy but still doesn't allow the audience really much understanding again permitting the audience to wallow in stereotypical characterization the cinematography and photography also is somewhat of a letdown because unlike jarhead or blackhawk down the crisp raw visceral presentation is missing not allowing the audience to really be there in the movie there is some distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen however overall the movie redeems itself by the end offering the audience a measured look into the complexity of the united states' use of rendition and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use eight out of ten stars
<START> alistair simms inspired portrayal of miss transcends drag it is one of the great comedy characters in film equally wonderful is joyce character ruby gates br br this is a movie you should curl up on the sofa with on a wet sunday's afternoon and be transported to a time long ago when terrifying rampaging school girls only gained our respect not our ire i hear that a remake is in the offing with rupert everett as miss he will have a hard job competing with the master or should that be mistress alistair simms br br go and rent it it beats so much of what today goes for comedy
<START> i gotta go with my boy allen who also reviewed this film zombie gangbangers as my copy is entitled guess they left out the ninja part after realizing there isn't a single ninja nor reference to ninjas anywhere in the whole f cking film is a total wasted of time honestly one of the most boring retarded films i've ever had the displeasure of viewing br br a hooker is repeatedly un graphically raped by two zombies and then by a cop again un graphically when the cop doesn't believe her story she meets a guy who was beaten up by said zombies and the two try to find a way to seek vengeance on the undead culprits br br first off there is no or really other banging at all to be had in zombie ninja gangbangers i was hoping to at least get some sort of horror porn hybrid a la porn of the dead or re penetrator or perhaps perverted stories but no there was absolutely no sex in this film at least a bit o' the ol' in out might have redeemed this boring garbage to some degree but without it we get a bunch of poorly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero payoff i'm all for trash films and most other schlock gore porn and exploit material but this one honestly sucks in every conceivable way save your time pass this one up 1 10 and the one is only for a few brief shots of some sub par titties
<START> what an awful adaptation the worst part was the music saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's the only character that didn't bore me to sleep was robert hardy i had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and i love jane austen movies usually i didn't even rent it i borrowed it from the library they should have paid me to take it i don't quite understand how catherine and henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another isabella and her brother were way overdone it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isn't this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies i've seen
<START> while researching susan harrison the ballerina in reference to a bonanza episode i was reminded of this gem br br this episode is the inspiration for dylan's all along the watch tower hendrix's cover is probably as well know and is one of his best which is one of his best br br thus this episode is responsible for several not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television br br but this is the twilight zone further comment of the series is unnecessary br br characters' is typical serling intense dramatic barreling toward an end that is as inevitable in hindsight as it is surprising the first time you see it br br this episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen it br br but you will feel ambushed and you will never listen to hendrix with the same ears again
<START> now i have seen two movies by the director chen kaige a very good one farewell my concubine and this bad one the assassin both movies depict crucial events in chinese history fmc in the 20th century and ta the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century bc fmc with memorable characters gorgeous cinematography convincing sets good acting and an interesting story the assassin fails on nearly every level okay the sets are great the cinematography is good and the few battle scenes are quite exciting but the pathos call me a cynic but too much is too much if you felt that saving private ryan was too pathetic be aware this here will make you sick the dialogue is lifeless many lines seem like political statements subtle or entertaining is this pic not the film is overpowered by its own i am really surprised that the assassin gets such high votes here on imdb 4 10
<START> actually i'll admit i'm a political junkie so this resonated with me but the erratic nature of ms green yes i know what they did to her but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself br br why can't barry l and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do let us debate it br br instead they have this oh i'm not worthy bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down stop the disney ending and putting a bow on it life isn't easy they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone br br we had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie and then it turned sniveling and the stupid inane behavior by ms green when the crap was out of her system just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake
<START> this film is boring boring boring boring and boring it's not the worse film i ever saw on the contrary but how shall i put this it's boring there is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it if it was advertised as a travelogue i would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot some drama and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion br br i read some of the comments on this board about this films and i wondered if they saw the same movie as i did br br see this film yawn at your own risk one thing for sure it really is rated correctly g rating which most stand for god awful boring
<START> spoiler but probably not br br the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it br br anymore diddy is gone aswell br br the 1st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favorite br br super nintendo games the other being super mario world br br the 2nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels br br although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times br br however this one is the worst of the lot it does not have the feel of br br the original or 2nd the enemy's look stupid and the levels are br br even worse it does not look realistic anymore i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two the first had great br br background music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in this br br game is horrible br br it happens a lot these days that movies shows and sometimes br br video games that start out fantastic end up with it being ruined by br br a stupid sequel i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as good br br now that it has donkey kong 3 br br they should have left it at the original or maybe the 2nd one
<START> i vowed some time ago to never get another joe castro film perhaps after near death but i sort of ended up with this one by accident since it was a troma release i didn't read the cover carefully oops well i watched it and it's by no means good but it's i guess sort of tongue in cheek if it's not it sure seemed that way some intrepid folks from the university of the rio grande set out to find if the exists because of surveillance camera footage from someone's goat barn that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision and also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition there's a couple of camera men one of whom whines the whole time and there some ex marine named army who is some kind of munitions expert or something at any rate the do find the on some guy's ranch set out to find it getting involved with two supposed witches along the way the creature itself is rather ridiculous looking with spines on its back a great big long tongue that gene simmons would die for eventually after a bunch of folks done get killed so does the and they take it back to the university for an autopsy so is it from another planet is it a genetic creation from some lab in puerto rico uh they don't tell us really not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either definitely not a wide audience for this one 4 out of 10
<START> at the beginning it was almost a shock to see norma shearer without her makeup then she glamorizes herself and becomes the life of the party br br anyway she divorces her husband makes herself over and gets on with her life or so she thinks somewhat keeps you guessing if they'll get back together
<START> they missed up the film when the tried to use some one they should of keeped ralph macchio as danny instead of changing it and made more karate kids with him in it and also many people were what happen to danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four
<START> fata morgana is an absolute masterpiece it's werner herzog's most unconventional film it doesn't have a plot or story instead of a story we're given a collection of images words and music that work so wonderfully together it's not a documentary either some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read it has some of the most beautiful and haunting images herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror the use of music in this movie is so brilliant from leonard cohen mozart and the third ear band imagine stanley kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey in the desert that's what this movie is like this film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body a must see it will change the way you view films rating 10 out of 10
<START> one would have expected hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution surely few expected his most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy but that is precisely what they got strangers on a train br br what is remarkable is how much bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress guy is making of his life and hence the society he represents or is eager to join guy is the archetypal american the working class boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome bruno is his destructive opposite gay decadent he lives off his father in a big house and just lounges about dreaming of murder bruno's life is one of repetition circularity whereas guy moves straight ahead it is bruno's achievement to move guy into his realm represented by the merry go round and force him to break the law hope for murder bruno's br br bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy all the authority figures in the film are criticised bruno's father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film especially in aunt clara's paintings that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere anna's incredibly machiavellian self serving father the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of after an execution the tennis commentator whose smugly comments are always mistaken far from being the mother hater of legend hitch as robin wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy br br bruno's transgression turns the world topsy turvy this is hitch's most surreal film whenever guy is in his plot he is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music but whenever bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes bizarre much more fun this is hitch's first truly american film revelling in the primitive detritus of americana grown men puncture little boys' balloons or try to throw them off merry go rounds distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains elderly society are strangled at elegant washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting dali painting there is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of magritte just look at any scene with bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarre br br abound in the most ridiculous permutations check all those balloons hitch had obviously just seen the third man as well as in more staid environs washington will never look the same again strangers is also vertigo notwithstanding hitch's most overtly sexual film as well as the there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with horses the fellatio joke when hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman br br and yet hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense in the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place much has been made of bruno as a prototype of norman bates and hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing bruno into murder there is a hilariously painful sequence where bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame guy down a drain the gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience i was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success and hitch milks it with callous glee listen to the mocking music and compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously br br strangers is one of hitch's five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema the dialogue is so strange and brilliant i can't believe it wasn't written by chandler patricia hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts guy the fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set piece black comedy and symbolic site if bruno's final words condemn him to hell according to the catholic hitch is supposed to embody compare with a similar ending in the killers we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to guy's debased serving of self
<START> when i tuned in to my local pbs station last night to watch the war that made america i was expecting a dull documentary instead i got a very good and believable reenactment of the major events of the time now i see the reasons for the american revolution and the part the indian wars played larry is george washington and he is perfect for that part the narrative to the camera also work fantastic i'm looking forward to next week to see the rest it's good to see pbs really using the hd format to bring the 1700 right in to our living room br br i hope larry is seen more in the future since he is such a talented actor
