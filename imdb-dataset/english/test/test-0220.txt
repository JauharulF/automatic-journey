<START> okay here is a really short review this movie blowed i wish i could just have a review that stated this simple principle but i must bore you with more bad review type words like 'horrible' and ' it's the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do here's the premise the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a play off hockey game and only van damm can stop the madness truly truly terrible but then again i didn't pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in his wallet after this movie i hate the fact he is a republican and all but then again he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage okay that is now enough space to be recognized as a review so i bid adieu
<START> i wasted enough time actually watching this chore of a movie i don't want to waste more writing a big review not once did i so much as crack a smile all the jokes were boring forced and lacked any kind of wit i kept saying wheres the punchline almost every single character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the situations were clichÃ©d and half the time there wasn't even any kind of solution things just happened to get to the next scene for the life of me i can't understand how this got as many good reviews as it did if you like clunky acting and poorly composed film making fat girls is the movie for you
<START> stay away from this movie it is terrible in every way bad acting a thin recycled plot and the worst ending in film history seldom do i watch a movie that makes my adrenaline pump from irritation in fact the only other movie that immediately springs to mind is another people in an aircraft in trouble movie airspeed please please don't watch this one as it is utterly and totally pathetic from beginning to end helge
<START> i missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week i had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what i saw i left the theater thinking i had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like br br the full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves br br the problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess there are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens shots of people in a city that go on much too long with no purpose in the narrative we get beautiful vistas and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes but they are used too frequently as a place holder instead of as punctuation or to set a place much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good br br i've attempted to actually sit down and watch heavens gate with out resorting to the fast forward button but somewhere along the way i find i can't stand it any more br br i wish mgm would take pity on us and release the shorter version to dvd as well as the huge dinosaur perhaps as a two pack so that we could see which is the better version and whether cimino was mad or not br br and while they were at it why not include the once rumored johnson county war edit that ran 90 minutes supposedly united artists tinkered with a further cut in the hopes of getting some of their money back whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air but it would be interesting to see
<START> fantastically written acted and produced loved seeing this gleaming talented cast every single one of them give a such great performance this movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart great storytelling br br this is a great movie for black history month full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain with dignity and a belief in a better future it is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood the next time you're in the company of a listening and observing child remember show or he may be a writer in the making
<START> this movie was a suprise for me while i was surfing from channel to channel i don't know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly i liked it this is a must see one br br
<START> this movie is such a waste of talented people and hollywood budget it made me think everyone in the movie was paying off a favor by being in it because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible trash pile of a film it's a contrived plot that is just pathetic unrealistic and not even close to fun or interesting the only thing that kept my interest was the numerous big names in the movie that kept popping up for no apparent reason and who had no acting or good lines to contribute to the mess of a film i kept expecting it to have some good stuff since all of these people had been cool in other films but it never came through this film should be shown in prison as punishment but that would be cruel and unusual you will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parading around such a horrible pathetic script with flat lines and horrifically bad acting this movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with lots of recognizable faces big trouble 2002 which also went off the readable scale on the suck o meter
<START> the word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task in 1927 it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort nevertheless it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination such then is the heart of this movie called the spirit of st louis the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america's own james stewart who convincingly plays charles lindbergh although there are many facets of life the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic the story is an interesting one and for fans compelling to say the least seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may 1927 as he was christened endured enormous risks which are featured in this superb film other notables which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud gurney bartlett robinson as ben mahoney arthur space and charles watts as o w schultz the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut it has since become a classic in it's own right well done
<START> this movie was so awful i don't even know where to begin the only positive thing i can say about it is that luke perry gave a good performance the entire movie was all over the place there was no explanation as to the cause only theories of the eruptions or for their solutions or why it would work it was ridiculous all the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy you just wanna laugh there was just no background to any of them the love relationship seemed to have been added on to the script it was so awkward there's an army man big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth with the i'm the man attitude such a pathetic bad guy the two sidekicks who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys and then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebody's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he's coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something and then plays hero cheesiest scene of all to help the plan which is to do who knows what its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene in a nutshell don't waste your time
<START> thankfully i watched this film alone enabling me to fast forward through the worst scenes aka most of the film actually ok some of it is not all bad with partially good photography even some of the under water scenes and at times not too bad directing but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting additionally when i don't find the movies hottie to be all that even the wannabe sexy love making scenes get dull really dull and for the drama you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies br br if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie if not stay well clear
<START> the true story of devi who became a national hero in india because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner i was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of india instead of the bollywood art trash classics they churn out
<START> ideas are dangerous comment by one interviewee br br dvd rating b 4 out of 5 8 out of 10 worth the time br br a great story for adults or teen boaters but not for children none of the stupid violent crime stuff so often mistaken by hollywood these days as quality work and it can be used as a trainer film on what proper boating preparation is all about or not about prior to sailing the seven seas the movie starts out somewhat slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do but as it draws the viewer into the saga emotions begin to in one's head emotions include anger sadness and disbelief the era late 1960's br br that solo sailing around the globe is dangerous is not surprising what is surprising is all the twists that viewers wouldn't expect its not your average group of guys in a sailing race each boat was different as allowed by the race rules each solo sailor had different levels of ability as allowed by the race rules there were well known sailors among them and a few not so well known one was considered a mystery man as nobody seemed to have any knowledge of his ability at all each boat was allowed to depart at will so long as all were underway by a certain date and this was of course prior to modern electronics that allow boaters to communicate with shore about vicious storms etc br br actual video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews of family members and others involved the mood of the interviewees is always somber despite the years that have passed br br the main character don is the focus of attention how his journey relates to those who he not only wanted to beat but due to circumstances of his own creation had to beat he had to win the story was about what that circumstance did to his life as he moved south west across the atlantic ocean over a years time alone on the water br br do not fail to view the special features section of the dvd once the film is finished the entire saga isn't fully understood w o viewing the 'bonus' stuff br br in the end once you've watched everything on the dvd you will likely just shake your head and exclaim 'wow ' and keep in mind that is why the story has remained alive for the last 40 years br br spoiler do not fail to view the special features section of the dvd once the film is finished one sailor who was headed back to england after the globe decided on the fly that no he was going for another spin and the film records his spouse's opinions about that decision the opposite story unfolds as another sailor wishes the race allowed two on board so he could take his wife along and their photos demonstrate a very warm union between them the interview with an ex paratrooper who had actually rowed a boat across the atlantic with a friend prior to the solo sail race was incredibly funny as he described not even knowing how to sail and who thought the bad things happening to him were 'normal ' too many people think that setting sail in the open sea can be an romantic adventure without mishap don't you be one
<START> i can accept the fact this was the next karate kid so ralph macchio can be happily retired from the series and while hillary swank is great for the role the plot to the movie is just dreadful br br mr miyagi's old buddy from world war 2 dies leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand daughter when her parents die in an accident the girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local rotc which i'll explain in a minute has it out to get her you know the drill miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after br br its hokey its cheesy its the 90's but that's not even the long and the short of it my first case of huh is why is there a military division in high school i thought that stuff went out in the 1960's especially in a public school as much as michael ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel since when is military involved in a high school my next gripe is that during the prom scene the militants jump to scare the crap out of people why the thing i noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through billy in part 1 sato in part 2 in part 3 this movie is no different after ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom blow up eric's car and threaten hillary swank the whole movie ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like um no if you're gonna do pathetic face turns at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod br br as for the rest of the love plot between eric and hillary swank corny but nothing to melodramatic which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage ralph macchio pulled in the first 3 movies br br i will say for its own movie after watching the first 3 movies i can accept it being more or less a spin off but i can't accept the whole military thing way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously now if ironside and crew was a wrestling football team and he was the coach that would have been more believable br br ironside and morita deliver the goods swank is ok the rest are the same as anything the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod that was cool 4 out of 10
<START> the first 20 minutes were a little fun because i don't think i've seen a film this bad before acting script effects etc the rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect these people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie there's no adult language a bit of brief nudity and no gore except fake blood smeared over no open wounds etc it would have been rated pg in the early eighties and pg 13 nowadays i'm not sure how it got an r rating or if it really did i saw the american international release titled hospital of terror i've seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film i've ever seen here's an example of how bad it is there's one scene where something green comes through the door i'm not sure what it's supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kid's green crayon scribblings i'm not exaggerating super imposed over the film semi moving inside the door then its supposed to do something to nurse sherri to possess her i suppose i could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment
<START> i was really surprised when i came across this movie on cable tv a couple of years ago the story is a wonderful example of how our land keeps changing and the fight to hang on to it and use it according to need conflicting desires of the people and the government the actors were fantastic in their portrayals and i absolutely fell in love with cardinal she is so believable and was such a character in this movie as was rip torn the story was also a love story about the land the past and between the 2 main characters i have tried to buy this film and have been unable to locate it but i would sure would love to own it
