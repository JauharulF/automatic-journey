<START> leno talks through his punch lines this spoils the joke for those of you who haven't figured it out his show is held in a micro sized studio for a reason or two reasons the small amount of laughter will be amplified and few want to see him letterman's set is the polar opposite ed sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full br br nbc tacky nbc will never get it founder david megalomaniacal enterprise continues to be all about the money at least cbs has a bit of a family feel to it br br leno collects cars or is it stamps while letterman races cars the difference is informative br br when i i used to ask other to email me if leno ever said something that was funny i never got a single email letterman has superb timing he also can re use the most unfunny joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night's show br br letterman has built other careers paul is now well known and respected in his own musical right even paul's other band members get recognition and career boosting biff henderson has become a name america knows of even the businesses in the same block as the ed sullivan theater get a boost what has leno ever done for anyone else personally i am glad that dave moved and leno got the carson gig i never watched nbc shows before and had no reason to after br br the top ten list is an american icon so is letterman leno is a dream nothing more

<START> it is a surprising movie that gets you in your chair waiting for the last minute of the film leaving on your leaps a sweet taste of i want more there are very good actors portuguese actors that have a lot of experience in the world of theater and films it is not a million euros budget film but still we can see the destruction of a car in an excellent perspective that gets you in the movie if you have the opportunity of getting your hands on this excellent film don't wait for another minute just see the film i think that portuguese film are increasing the quality watch out spanish producers the portuguese are getting a high quality standards i saw the film and i'm waiting for more
<START> or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks br br i mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past very bad things groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts br br noble idea totally in it's execution
<START> if rich people are different from us because they have more money then film makers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought br br this self indulgent piece of tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another movie and someone would finance it not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a movie unless you are a college film student trying to complete a course when you don't have anything to say sometimes it is best to remain quiet br br the visuals are not breath taking they are quite ordinary the dialog is inane and unbelievable they speak words no one would every sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination germaine f k is finally brought to the screen even if you believe in love at first sight no one falls into bed as easily as these characters they screw before they talk even more unbelievable is an aging balding director finding instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town though gravity is already getting to miss at a youthful age
<START> weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance none of that explains why this is such a bad film br br it's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available the acting is flat even the sparkling ziyi zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera br br the cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap the editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi particularly the closing routine performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order
<START> i couldn't stop watching this movie though it was far past my bedtime br br comparisons to hitchcock are deserved this thing really plays with you it walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark distancing humor like many of hitch's heroes our doe eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy br br the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication who is to be trusted and who is a monster the plot twists and turns unpredictably suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork imagery music but most simply the eyes of the characters which sends raw fear right into you br br a warning there is some frighteningly real gore as well as some nudity the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage slasher pic br br and a teen slasher pic it ain't the characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing a couple including the heroine you may even find endearing as i did there will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown ups i mean alec guinness is in it briefly and you know he didn't need the work br br pop this in the vcr some night when you can't sleep and don't want to yet
<START> this movie is scary at times perhaps no more so than when a naked george kennedy tells his hooker girlfriend he wants a little more sugar thankfully his nakedness is covered by a blanket but the image is still more horrifying than anything you're likely to find in for example schindler's list br br the dialog in this film was inspiring it inspired me to watch another movie in one scene when a stewardess remarks about male pilots kennedy asks why do you think it's called a pit charming br br and yes contrary to what some have written this film is very very bad
<START> i wasn't able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film in and age of dv cameras it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphone br br as a filmmaker myself i know the constraints of indy film making and even keeping those things in mind i'm amazed films can be made this poorly br br the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i've seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release i'm guessing the box is what sold it it does have good box art but it all goes downhill from there br br side note it seems the director has 11 friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a 10
<START> i was looking forward to watching this movie and it does contain very interesting perspectives from iraqis all over the country not just in major areas br br however as the film went on and as it seemed to become increasingly more one sided i started wondering who had edited the film to get several hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes obviously decisions had to be made br br i would have really enjoyed a film that showed how everyday iraqis felt on all sides of the issues but with the newspaper headlines in contrast to what people were saying and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end i thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre conceived bias br br it could have been such a great film
<START> beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen not for its cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni one of italy's most famous directors however if you gave this film only a quick watch over passively i mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances this movie deserves great attention to the point of embracing all its cheese by cheese i don't mean a slice but a whole brick of cheddar the music seems like it's from some italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head br br but once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known the basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people cannot communicate to each other instead they can only communicate through each other i suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic br br i left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful i hate because i have reason but what does the hated think maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary in other words melodramatic br br so melodrama is actually an existential function a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do br br this is a great film i recommend it to all
<START> the consequences of love there is really something special about this film but it's very hard to put your finger on it is a love story of sorts but not really one i've seen before it has several love themes running throughout the film one mans love for a younger woman a younger mans love for his older brother the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end the cast are all superb from sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight faced ness of the films central character with simple yet affective camera work bounced off an ever changing soundtrack that mixes low fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces the style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever getting cluttered love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the tales we are told rumble towards various conclusions the director has married old and new into a rich italian classic
<START> if you find the first 30 minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it don't give up also hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans who don't see and hear a lot of danish films anyway as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his her patience br br being a fan of the movie out of africa this film piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by karen the major character in that film br br the meal babette's feast was amazing i'm no chef but i was impressed how one interprets the story too varies i suppose depending on how much you read into this and where you stand religion wise if the latter how you look at the definition of can affect how you interpret this story br br in any case it's a fine film but don't watch this if you're dieting
<START> spoilers below 'night mother is the story of jesse sissy spacek a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to her brash mother anne bancroft that she's going to commit suicide this is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement the brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat the story that follows is lacking in substance gravity and revelatory value where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives where are the secrets revealed the confessions and fantasies and regrets they're here but they've all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and celebrates the of playwright marsha norman at the expense of everything else the result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test br br let me preface my comments by saying i find sissy spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures a woman so magnetic so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom she brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does and i've seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes her soft voice and sweet smile it was because of the great spacek that i watched this film in the first place and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way this film fails in two br br first and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the pulitzer winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive the entire movie is a two woman dialogue between jesse and her mother what worked on stage a middle aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house dies on film a play no matter how great needs to be adapted for the screenÂ it is self indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not of a word of it can be altered the screenplay for this film could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages and a knowing screenwriter would have given the brilliant spacek and competent bancroft some physical sequences some facial reactions something to break up the wall to wall yak fest and prison like single set it is no wonder that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright marsha norman who may know theater but reveals herself here to be clueless in film br br i cannot over emphasize the effect the stage play script has on the film watching jesse and her mother argue about jesse's impending suicide is redundant and dull the women walk from the living room into the kitchen into the den and back into the living room where they start all over again a tiny midwestern house is not the ideal location for a single set film and the director never tries anything clever or original never tries to break up the monotony with an exterior shot or cutaway or a flashback or anything there's no music no other characters no other stories just two women covering the couch cushions and arguing their opinions the reverence given to the play is even shakespeare's most solemn classics get shaken up for the screen the commitment to the original play seems almost it's as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play with the audience an afterthought br br the other reason the film fails is anne bancroft she may be a good stage actress but on film where presence is 80 of performance she rarely seems to fit she certainly doesn't fit here playing a midwestern grandmother but looking more like mrs robinson before her morning coffee she chases jesse around the house looking more aggravated than astounded and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic even when her lines convey a loving if flawed woman br br sissy spacek is great as she always is honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her character's choice sissy lets us see that jesse is a flat tire a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices she's never had control of her life and her suicide will be her way of finally saying no more this is where i get off that's how she puts it anyway and when spacek you listen she proves in all her films that a good actress doesn't have to behave like a man doesn't have to be all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone in this and in films like coal miner's daughter she quietly demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is you can't help but fall in love br br that's why it was so hard for me to watch 'night mother spacek is wasted in a stilted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract i would not recommend this movie to anyone except die hard fans of sissy like myself and even then you'll be disappointed i do give the film an entire letter grade bonus for the ending which is courageous enough to let the lead character do what's right for her and not pander to a hackneyed happy ending grade c
