<START> this is a wonderful comedy short one of keaton's absolute best through a long series of silly mistakes buster is mistaken for a wanted killer and as a result most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular while generally i am not a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability i have seen some that have had wilder stunts but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace in particular there is a scene where he runs across a table jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the as as is humanly possible plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone by the way this film is very similar to cops also by keaton but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing br br this film is brilliant and the only keaton short i can think of that i probably liked even more was the playhouse where buster plays every role at the theater
<START> sequels well there are many reasons to make 'em but what went through irwin allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters there are so many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous like the poseidon which is a ship with passengers on is drifting on the sea and just michael caine with his and an evil telly savalas discover the boat well at the beginning the french marine are circling above the wreck with their helicopter but as a sinking is a daily thing they just fly away what am i trying to say hmmm michael caine goes on board with sally field and he might pick up everything he sees diamonds if there wasn't a telly savalas who is looking for weapons on the ship my god why in fact am i wasting my words on here it's ridiculous and knowing that both field and caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts certainly not diamonds
<START> a movie like this doesn't come along too often i'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it politicians and civilian hawks should view this before making decisions on how the destroy peoples lives i watched this the day after viewing the tv version of uprising about the warsaw ghetto even with this fresh in mind i felt sympathy for the german soldier i felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen it will take awhile to thaw out from this one i'm surprised they have not made a movie based on the forgotten soldier by buy this movie shares the cold with the book both will haunt me for the rest of my life
<START> it is always a well known and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes in the crucial opening scenes the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film here in mute witness we find a prime example of this br br scene spoiler br br in the first 5 10 minutes the film opens to a very hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment with the radio on she's wandering around applying lipstick herself up and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose of course the serial killer is in her house and monitoring her moves knife in hand she hears a noise looks in a room and there is her partner in a pool of blood at the very point of her screams she turns around to be faced with the knife wielding maniac who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act br br then something odd happens as the woman in her death throes the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish before he finds his lighter his cigarette is lit from someone else in the room the camera pans out and we realise that there are more and more people in the room some taking notes some filming some recording the death and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die and making a very hammy job of it too when the audience realises what's going on and the whole scene is part of a film the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour br br end scene spoiler br br i have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons firstly it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly a thriller in the style of hitchcock or de palma with some very and even blackly humorous moments it conveys a central subject matter that of the difference between a 'movie screen death' and a 'snuff film death' an issue which is elaborated on later in the film and finally it introduces the viewer to the characters all as silently as possible br br the plot of mute witness centres around billy hughes an american special effects make up artist who is working on the set of the film being shot in a large warehouse in moscow billy cannot speak but she communicates in sign language through her sister after the end of an evening's filming billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident and in her attempt to escape is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film but turns out to be a snuff movie suddenly her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death br br without doubt the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping billy's saving grace and her handicap is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound in fact in my opinion one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock full of women screaming there are some utterly disturbing moments and some superb set pieces of real suspense the and the elevator shaft are perfect examples the timing is fluid and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself br br the second half of the film introduces new concepts while there are still several suspenseful moments the focus is on plot twists new characters are introduced and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on while there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half there are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes but there are also some very lame comedy moments coming specifically from billy's sister and her fiancÃ©e who happens to be the director of the movie billy is working on that almost ruin the film just because they are badly misplaced and or mistimed and ruin the pace at the end the twists keep coming at a rapid fire speed and the climax of the film is appropriately as tense as the first half br br there are several things that really make the movie work the barriers of communication that billy must face both as a mute and as an american in moscow mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation the actress that plays billy natasha does a wonderful job in the film with an engaging on screen prescence and a brilliant performance and finally the direction as a whole but most particularly in the first half of the film which truly is a study in alfred hitchcock's suspense thriller film techniques br br as i have already said though the let downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added there is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of karen hughes and andy clarke the sister and the to turn their scenes into some unusual sit com however despite these shortcomings the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller and ideal for a group viewing at halloween certainly better than the usual slasher horror film
<START> i've watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now when i came across it on dvd i didn't hesitate too long even more because i have a predilection for early belmondo flicks but what a bad surprise some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure to preserve a certain memory and not to shock audiences br br widely hailed as one of chabrol's rare cynic works the only lasting impression i got from re watching it is boredom some movies really do not age in style but what about movies which didn't have any sense of style at all br br the flaws in the script uninspired acting presumably due to the lack of direction a sort of production design which doesn't deserve its name less than mediocre photography and last but not least the worst editing job i've seen in ages make this one truly hard to stand br br my impression was that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously no idea or any skills at all it really comes as a surprise that this one didn't abruptly end chabrol's career don't blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever
<START> pitch black was a complete shock to me when i first saw it back in 2000 in the previous years i was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci fi movies ex starship troopers and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different but to plainly put it this movie freaked me out in a good way i wasn't aware that i was still afraid of the dark till i watched this movie i must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when i was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there br br the alien creatures sent shivers up my spine the individual s who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque br br i loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion br br vin diesel gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping at first you figure him out to be a coldly intelligent villain but in some brief moments you can see something humane behind his animal side but as soon you discover it he does something maliciously devious he certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end i didn't know whether to despise or admire him he's definitely a love hate type of character br br johns cole hauser was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive john's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as devious as riddick br br fry radha mitchell is a character who as johns so nicely expressed looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences but what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance even while endangering her life when others discarded all human values and went for the dark hills running br br jack griffith simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in riddick through a child's eye good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil i thought it was absolutely priceless when jack shaves his head in ode to riddick you know what they say imitation is the best form of flattery br br imam keith david like jack has the ability to see good in any evil he uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships that he meets and when time permits he rationally grieves his losses and then soldiers on in a way he served as a morale booster for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening br br the casting for this movie was positively perfect each actor shined brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on screen br br this movie may have had a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects do all the work for them this movie is a definite sci fi classic watch it and judge with an open mind for yourself it will be well worth it
<START> a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities br br it starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks i'm not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie br br she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david hasselhoff and his german speaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff he's taking photographs and she's translating an esoteric german book about witches i think br br also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couple's children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately br br the hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn't used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorder br br people start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots since we're not seeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty there's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions br br in the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa 4 and ghosthouse 2 that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa 3 ghosthouse la 1988 it's not that's also a better movie than this one la casa 1 and two were the evil dead 1981 and evil dead ii 1987 again unrelated to witchery and la casa 3 and much better than those there's also a casa 5 la 1990 aka house 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house house 1986 house ii the second story 1987 the horror show 1989 aka house iii and house iv 1992 how's the horror show fit in there it doesn't really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa 5 is also aka horror house 2 does your head hurt yet
<START> just seen which way to the front on tcm uk it is a truly awful film if i'd paid at the pictures i'd have walked out br br a terrible mess of a film byers lewis and his mates prance around in cast off uniforms from an italian sci fi movie of 1960's were the cnd peace symbol badges on the uniforms meant to be ironic the sets were pure 1970 i'm sure a hollywood tv back lot could have provided a more realistic set br br the film is riddled with racism the film takes the mickey out of veterans br br not funny how lewis every got to make another film is beyond me
<START> i cringed when i heard the first canned laugh track in the first few seconds of the show but yet i gave it a chance you know when someone offers a line which is only slightly amusing and you hear an obviously fake laugh track explode in uproarious laughter that it's a show aimed at morons who need to be told yes it's funny go ahead and laugh br br ugh i couldn't stand this show as it revealed itself i can't speak for everyone after all some people actually like that idiotic show stacked which makes me wish to vomit i can imagine those who like stacked might actually like this drivel too some people still get a kick out of the old pull my finger gag to me this show is just about as witty and just about as original br br the themes were old and tired the jokes were lame and hackneyed the characters were ones we've seen everywhere before and the worst of any you might imagine br br so if you like things like burping words and neighbors who say pull my finger you might actually like this show otherwise pass it by it's stupid and not in a clever or original way this one is about as old and tired as any show has ever been at its premiere
<START> alright we start in the office of a shrink and apparently not a very good one the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office out random rhymes about jack frost gee alright my brother is yelling it off '' anyway back to the crappy movie br br the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie but he looks nothing like him yadda yadda yadda they laugh at the poor sheriff yadda yadda now some people are digging up the anti snowman yadda yadda now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people i don't quite see how this has to do anything but their poking the anti freeze evil killer mutant snowman with needles heating it shocking it adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it the whole nine yards nothing alright they give up and leave it in a fish tank one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank the janitor walks in cleans stuff bumps the and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive br br behold the power of mocha now somehow he is in uh i believe the bahamas but it looked more like hawaii but it couldn't be hawaii unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets bah i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self er i wouldn't suggest doing so though sheesh
<START> steve martin looks like he's had a face lift something very strange about his face i usually like anything steve does but this movie comes off as trashy not funny didn't think charlene encouraging him to be rough with his wife was a good message to be sending out to teens watching this film
<START> as embarrassing as it is to admit i was listed as production manager on this film my very first as a matter of fact it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated watch carefully and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes as a soon to be murdered asylum attendant named my own last name br br originally titled hostages this picture was changed to another son of sam by the producer director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time nothing could have helped i don't even think this picture was good enough to be shown on mst 3k br br the film was shot primarily with a collection of old mitchell cameras and early hand held cameras matter of fact the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own wwii era the picture was filmed entirely in charlotte and belmont north carolina in the mid seventies most of the stars were local tv newscasters and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or gullible enough to believe former stuntman and producer director dave a adams' delusions of br br if you enjoy watching this kind of picture you might love the work of another north the legendary earl br br
<START> there was no need for this movie plain and simple the original although hated by some was something i found to be actually really entertaining mainly because it was before jim carrey started to really lose his touch and cameron diaz was well 'nuff said so why make a sequel prequel thing honestly knowing that jim carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created but then they just make mistake after mistake jamie kennedy why is this man still allowed to breathe the writing and story terrible why would i ever want to see a baby wearing the mask moreover why would i want to see it fly ever how did someone think this was a good idea the acting is despicable in fact nearly everything about this movie is i'm trying to keep calm or imdb probably won't let me post this bottom line don't watch this piece of trash pick up the original see how good cameron diaz looked and how jim carrey used to have a career and laugh don't waste even a second of your time on this
<START> italian soft x exorcist clone br br woman buy statue of crucified thief said thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies br br ivan rassimov plays the devil brilliantly mostly due to his gift of evil looks and because he was never above doing nudity good on him br br the actress in the lead did a decent job her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped br br this one has a similar plot element to most italian horror films the girl's parents are filthy rich and depraved watch it to get the details br br laura gemser's husband gabriel also appears as a random stud his part is basically phoned in but like a cheap beer it did the job br br fault the director for its failings this could have been a horror sex classic
<START> i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the 3 way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at 4 30 in the morning what a very entertaining rich funny and well developed plot line and script we both thoroughly enjoyed it my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work going on to recommend it and say what a kick she got out of it i am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old an unexpected very enjoyable surprise nice work thanks two thumbs up
