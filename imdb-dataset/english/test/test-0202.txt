<START> hari om is about an impossible love between a french tourist and the auto rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a rendezvous with her indifferent boyfriend a sort of third world road movie that careens from lush reverie to madcap comedy it is distinguished by the stellar performance of vijay who has become one of india's actors after his appearance as the event planner in mira nair's monsoon wedding br br in an interview proves to be quite untouched by his success responding rather carefully and pensively to questions he discovered a love of acting and joined a major theatre troupe while in university but for one with so much formal training is surprisingly inarticulate about his craft he speaks of honesty and purity as the of his approach and the earnestness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear on screen conveys an emotional integrity and dramatic assurance that lifts his characterization to an extraordinary level and director has cast and directed him perfectly he has a wonderfully expressive face which the camera revels in close ups of that face are as compelling as shots of camille who is gorgeous as the frenchwoman
<START> a young couple decides to runaway to sunny california they never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the rest stop br br after a fight with her boyfriend nicole insists on pulling in to a rest stop when she is ready to leave she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car leaving her trapped on the back roads of texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company br br rest stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic will rest stop become a cult classic you may ask well the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are gore sex and artistic merit rest stop has bucket loads of gore and while i do not want to give too much away it contains oodles of blood soaked nastiness this movie has everything from the bad guy running over a cop's legs with his car several times to him making use of a drill on a girl's leg at times it can be about as bloody as a film can get it also has a gratuitous and yet somehow quite intimate love scene in the opening minutes of the film therefore the sex is covered now the hard one Â does it have any artistic merit you never get to see the bad guy's face Â you see glimpses profiles shadowy silhouettes he is a faceless relentless monster which alone scores highly on the artistic merit scale the movie has very few characters in it apart from the main protagonist Â nicole jaimie alexander since she spends a large part of the film on her own she cannot reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation but must speak them aloud so that we the audience know what she is thinking at times this can be slightly irritating however it is a brave step by the writer john and it does work for the majority of the film as an audience knows being completely alone and isolated from civilisation is frightening enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers br br so will rest stop become a cult classic it probably will because along the gore sex and arguable artistic merit it also has plenty of chills an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouting at the screen as the main character does plenty of things you should definitely not do when running from a psychotic killer what fun are horror movies if you cannot complain about the stupidity of the victims
<START> what you saw in bullitt and the french connection is nothing compared to what you have here the chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best you'll ever see this movie has become a classic crime drama from the heyday of 70's film making it's a gritty and realistic portrayal of the mean streets of new york city featuring one of the slickest wise guys ever put on screen tony lo behavior in this movie is cool as ice he's ripping off his own associates and making it look like the police are responsible his childhood friend roy scheider is a street detective who becomes puzzled by the disappearances of the mobsters you can tell that lo enjoying the game throughout the movie at times though the film gets dull but then right when you feel like giving up on it something big happens and it pulls you back in the score by don ellis sets the tone of the cold gray in new york city and to top it all off my man joe spinell shows up in an early role as the garage man br br score 7 out of 10 stars
<START> it's really not worthy of a 'best picture' consideration but as entertainment goes it does the job this is one that i've watched with pulse every time at least a dozen times br br most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done and we can recognize them from other work those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it br br this was a fun adventure sort of like the little rascals if they just had to be serious
<START> this episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror so far this season masters of horror has produced one really good episode the damned thing it is still early i have faith that the episodes will get better i admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline the episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring but the last fifteen minutes was really good though i am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possessed please save this season john carpenter i have faith that pro life will redeem the entire lackluster season so far br br you're an angry little elf
<START> i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i'd be able to relate to this film perfectly its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads br br there are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how rob lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his path the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless br br the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness this is one i think most could enjoy a few laugh out loud even if you are alone moments ensure that i'll certainly be watching this again
<START> i own this movie i am actually from the same town as the brother directors but that doesn't make the film any better but if one night you wanna watch something not serious and don't have and high expectations i strongly recommend demon summer yes the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny but it contains key elements of a horror comedy i just wanna see some small town kids make a movie full of effects and i say bravo to the campell brothers they are now making more movies and continuing a long dream demon summer was one of the movies that are gonna help them start a great career with a great future speed freak productions and compound pictures described in one word potential
<START> trust the excellent and accurate review this film is compelling and moving in that roughest most brutally beautiful film masterpiece way file under unforgettable strong meat or films that howl at the moon pixote gets into your nervous system and elevates you despite the pain on the screen here's an unrelated list of films that did the same thing for me i e engaged destroyed transformed inspired resonated this category transcends nerdy film top ten lists that seek film perfection a woman under the influence wages of fear saint jack funny bones out of the blue
<START> this is a very moving movie about life itself the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand it should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans and while some of us are gifted with a mind heart and sound body there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky or maybe we're the unlucky ones we don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions and see it only in one light what can this world do for me maybe we all wish we were like radio a loving happy individual who loves everyone
<START> i saw this interesting film back to back with the chinese french film 2046 at the recent dubai film festival both were intelligent works made the same year 2004 2005 both had the main characters living in a hotel in both films the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a location both dealt with love between a man and a woman both had wonderful music and riveting performances what a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in treatment of the subject somewhere at the beginning of the film a man walking on a pavement turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamp post the audience erupts into a volcano of laughter innocently but isn't that brief shot the synopsis of the film that entertains you for 2 hours while the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy e g using a stethoscope to listen to neighbor's conversation the film builds on what buster keaton and jacques tati had introduced to cinema earlier stoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of robin williams or the heartwarming danny kaye a sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of tati's works br br but the film is not mere comedy the anti automation statement cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it the dummy that acts as an ineffectual warning to the speeding lady the reference to as the fictitious company he works for etc are several cues that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer laugh yes but reflect on it and enjoy further br br the movie's strength lies in is brief staccato script by director paul that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy truth is boring dad is dead but nobody told him bad luck does not exist it is the invention of the losers and the poor then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on insomniacs you will not sleep through this lecture br br provides entertainment pegged to the subject the italians know best the mafia it is an existential mafia film br br since truth is boring the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of superb acting toni good music clever camera work luca a beautiful enigmatic actress magnani grand daughter of the great anna and powerful script the dessert is for the viewer to figure out whether what preceded in the film was the truth it would have been boring if it was wouldn't it
<START> eisenstein's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of when the russians under alexander nevsky defeated the knights eager to bring russia under roman catholicism made in 1938 nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda the germanic knights with their sinister and somewhat goofy helmets are obvious stand ins for the nazis the butchery by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of world war ii the film ends with a warning those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword made in delicate black and white somewhat reminiscent of a it also marked eisenstein's return to official favor by the late 1920s stalin wanted soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the russian public that stopped eisenstein's career in russia for a decade and in nevsky he came back with his more accessible film strong point is in its second half which features the battle itself and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history never before and probably never after a battle would be so vivid in the screen another strong point is beautiful haunting soundtrack using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time one of its weaker points the comic relief in the form of two simpleton russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian peasant is really jarring
<START> mickey mouse is now 75 years old he was created by walt disney a famous producer director etc i love the disney movies because it is great fun watching the cartoon movies altogether walt disney i think is the king of the creations everyone has got to love this creations and the movies by walt disney thank you walt for all the classic characters you made
<START> corny and horrible i was not surprised this short lived show didn't make it i remember fondly when tales from the crypt tried reusing these corny episodes like they were actually scary coupled with bad acting and lousy music i was surprised this crummy showed was ever conceived it never showed up again and one can only be thankful for this circumstance
<START> i loved the first 15 minutes and i loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead of its time method acting technique but this movie ultimately disappoints even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more disobedient citizens it still lacks punch and believability and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already br br and for the record despite rampant rumors to the contrary this movie has never been banned in the us i can't comment on the rumors of uk censorship but i'm suspicious hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing and i am more than willing to believe the nixon government had some influence on this decision however the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this rather careful and advertising driven fashion of doing business as for the present you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days
<START> i would like if they brought back surface i really enjoyed the show along with my family i felt the plot development and storyline were first rate like the other person said it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common denominator nothing but bland politically correct junk survives just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show this is the same thing that happened to the time travel show i think was called 8 days but should have been called did the olympics kill surface i know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest american hero
