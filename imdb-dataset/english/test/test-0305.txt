<START> if you like silly comedies like airplane you'll love this movie it's definitely in the style of airplane and scary movie a fun film it has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie michael jackson evan marriott joyce stuart pankin charlie and eric roberts the special effects are hokey but i think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy there is apparently two versions of the film one at blockbuster and one on the official website com the one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director there's some fun behind the scenes material filmed at neverland with michael jackson as well the movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's pg rated fun on the box
<START> this movie is so mild i tried not to expect anything greater from this film but still it was a big disappointment the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential this could have been so much better the characters are really simple no depth at all it's a shame that previously talented performers and didn't make the already poor characters any better the director just don't get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr p br br and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie that's hideous br br why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation br br it's too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it oh no
<START> the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting and i was really sold on the mother daughter relationship it is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects a story of how it really is i couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends the acting was quite exquisite and i hope we'll be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road
<START> in a time of bad if not plain awful comedies king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air it's a complete oxygen tank it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times nothing has been this good since married with children kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses and believe me it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius these guys truly understand what is funny i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing just once other funny people in this show are carrie janet spence and doug carrie's boss i'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers check it out if you haven't
<START> i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites it has all the charm 1940's quaintness and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious to boot barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking home life articles for a famous magazine under the premise that she is a married homemaker even the president of the magazine is under this delusion enter a handsome gi played by the talented dennis morgan just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy his simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home cooked meals she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation add to this that her fiancÃ© is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun throw in the character actor nicknamed cuddles who fits this name completely it becomes even more adorable this has become my must see movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season a wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime
<START> as a bruce campbell fan for nearly two decades i was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance unfortunately man with the screaming brain was itself a disappointment br br set in bulgaria where the sci fi channel makes its saturday night original films man with the screaming brain is a curious mix of '50s b movie horror body switching comedy violent revenge flick and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation if that doesn't make sense well neither does man with the screaming brain campbell plays a pharmaceutical company ceo who visits bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former communist country's half finished subway system the two fall in with a former kgb agent turned cab driver and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman br br a local scientist stacy keach and his goofy assistant ted raimi who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into campbell's damaged skull also they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand br br campbell escapes and with a hastily skull and the voice of the cab driver whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body echoing in his head sets off to find and kill the gypsy his robot wife does the same br br but first there's an attempt to emulate steve martin lily all of me when campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner just as he was playing his own evil hand in evil dead ii campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind br br at times screaming comes closest to another steve martin film the man with two brains as it also takes a silly approach to '50s sci fi clichÃ©s however it tries too hard for too little result and that goes double for ted raimi's semi comprehensible bulgarian oaf who gets entirely too much screen time nothing against raimi it's just that he's better in smaller doses br br in the end it's neither outrageous or funny enough to satisfy as a spoof nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a b movie pastiche i was glad that campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt as i feared having to say gee bruce that was really something br br perhaps the best praise i can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion and it was twice as good as alien apocalypse
<START> i originally saw this movie as a blockbuster vhs rental that was quite some time ago but still remembered it blockbuster doesn't have it anymore netflix didn't have it and there weren't many copies on the web only a few vhs copies recently did finally find it available in dvd form on ebay for a reasonable price in pal format but our dvd player will play pal discs on our ntsc tv br br wife and i both enjoyed it the style of the movie is a bit strong and many if not most of the parts are rather strongly over played as if amateurs were making it especially the kids but it's not bothersome the contrasts of societies are accentuated in the overplay br br there is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that the young in russia shouldn't try to escape their not so great life but instead should at least try to make things better first but that's not dominant it's fairly humorous most of the time br br some downplaying of the west commented upon by others isn't that at all imo i take it as a comment about expectations of the russian characters at least when taken from my western viewpoint perhaps it's a downplay of the west from a russian viewpoint which it is literally by the characters saying it br br i can't say how literally true to the film the english subtitles are but i can say that the subtitles were done very well full of english idioms as if done by a native english speaker complete with colorful language
<START> i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen i know that on this website it's received only negative reviews but for once i'd like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review i find the movie to be extremely funny and it has the perfect mix of everything it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it and i can't get enough of it the soundtracks brilliant i love it i understand why people may not love it as much as i do but i don't understand how people could hate it the movie is 100 brilliance blurred is amazing i never realised that aussie movies could be so good and i also never realised i could watch one movie so many times in a single day without getting sick of it i think that everybody should watch it whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12
<START> this was such a funny movie which was soon forgotten about probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies such as this the movie is not quit as predictable as one would think crawl is an unattractive but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend still an unlikely match for rebecca who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home when he helps feel more at ease at school by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more they become buddies but it is completely platonic when she realizes her boyfriend might propose she does not feel ready he seems to like her boyfriend but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility you kind of learn what a good friend crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married when her boyfriend proposes to her in front of the whole family she kicks crawl and puts him on the spot he tells the whole family that he proposes to her and gives her his diamond ring which it out was his the whole time he must have come from money or something well they never really show a close up of the ring the message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him rebecca's boyfriend who her parents love turned mean when we find out he his new girlfriend after rebecca amber and crawl so that rebecca would have broken up with crawl thinking they were a couple although they were not rebecca was mad at him which when you think about it was kind of unfair since they were not a couple but i think they were starting to like one another and i think she thought there was more the movie never showed them actually become a couple they left it open for the viewers to decide they never even actually kissed at any point although there was one part where they almost did that was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand many people saw it and said that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock but they were just friends the whole time even towards the end and she did not introduce him as her boyfriend still they never told her parents they were not engaged rebecca almost did even if he would never become her boyfriend they could have still been friends in the 90s for some reason men were in and there was this big stereo type that woman liked men not that there is anything wrong with that think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type which crawl proved to be through his friendship with rebecca but when i saw the movie i must admit if i went for looks i thought i would have gone for the first boyfriend still it was a creative movie that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others
<START> this could have been better but it was alright it helped me get away from my boredom i didnt even wanna see it the only reason i wanted to rent it is because jamie is in it he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie i give it a 4 out of 10
<START> this is one of the great movies of all time the story is fascinating and the actors are convincing your really identify with the characters william wyler proofs with this movie that he is a great director his craftsmanship is unsurpassed
<START> wolfgang peterson's in the line of fire is cunning and occasionally a truly white knuckled ride even if once or twice we might feel like we've been down similar roads before how could one not when clint eastwood right after allegedly closing the book on his western legacy likely closes the one on his gritty detective pictures don't count blood work in there but there's more than that because eastwood's character here a hard bitten demon ridden and hard as nails secret service agent has a slightly charming side to him even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he spouted his trademark lines there is some complexities going on here that don't rely on just the usual swagger and it's note worthy for how such a possibly contrived back story didn't save kennedy from being assassinated in 63 is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona which more than likely hides his wounds most of the time eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film however and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for him br br but there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional we still get the 'harry' type scenes of him being smarter and as smart ass over everyone else in the room and being scolded and told to back off by the top brass here a chief of staff including here protecting a president that wisely we never really see or know at all even the romantic sub plot which is sort of undercooked if there for some machismo laughs would make the picture a little sub par if the other quasi dirty harry aspect didn't come into the picture an indelible villain this time there's some extra hollywood suspense however intelligent suspense almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves with the john booth character played in an oscar nominated performance by john malkovich as someone who's described more as a predator than an assassin there's ways this could go wrong with the eastwood character but malkovich possibly trumps some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and un collected there's that devastating cringe worthy scene where he kills the bank teller and her roommate and as his past is revealed there's still that element of 'what the hell is with this guy' that keeps the audience and eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid it's a classic malkovich performance quintessentially creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalism br br it's also aside from the conventional points just a sleekly made picture from peterson and company and they come pretty close to the spunky pulp realism of don siegel but peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that had me grinning at times anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to vertigo jumping from rooftop to rooftop hero dangling from the ledge the 'twist' it still provides some shivers down my spine there's also the phone conversations between eastwood and malkovich where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game probably another kick in the ribs to but in the end even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp formalism in the climax it's also a characters picture in some ways throughout and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to ponder over at least in the suspense movie sense a great lead russo plays the female possible love interest sincere and mature and malkovich is top of the pops there's also a few notable supporting roles too and a fine studio score in there one of the better films of 1993
<START> this film plunges headlong into the realm of the surreal Ã  la lynch and jodorowsky with an atmosphere that is strangely compelling lulling the viewer with the dream like intensity of its images br br the narration is to be savoured the narrator being trapped behind a painting adjacent to the bed who often speaks for it vocalizing its desires and reasoning yes beardsley would sound like that br br there are some flaws but its strengths overwhelm its weaknesses the sequence with the woman wrenching herself out of the bed and crawling across the floor trying to escape will leave you breathless br br the film possesses a fin de siecle air about it and should be read as a disarming cry from the bowels of the 20th century br br find this film and bathe in it
<START> six months after high school laura dies during a race a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style originality or decent gore br br what it does deliver however are some stunningly awful musical interludes a few familiar faces including an early appearance from scream queen linnea quigley and a smattering of nudity a prerequisite of any slasher movie br br so forget the death lame and rather instead enjoy the movie's more memorably crap elements the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures the roller disco which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song ' gangster rock' as performed by the unforgettably awful an impromptu jamming session by the school's students christopher george hamming it up as chief red herring coach michaels and the cheesy music teacher who after his female students who for some reason find him quite irresistible br br towards the end of the film the action picks up a little with the discovery of the slaughtered kids' bodies under the bleachers and a quite twisted scene featuring laura's corpse in her cap and gown but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity
<START> this is a great late night movie what i mean by that is that i truly have enjoyed playing my 3 00 vhs copy now i have a 6 99 dvd copy many nights just before bedtime or if i have insomnia there's just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated viewings it could be the fun that basil rathbone has in the secret weapon wearing several disguises which fool the bad guys and holmes's assistant nigel bruce watson but not the housekeeper mary gordon it could be the espionage code cracking and ww ii theme it could even be the light touch which the director uses to handle the threatening situations holmes finds himself in while keeping the story moving whatever it is secret weapon is simply a pleasant and enjoyable detective story which takes us back to a time when the nazis were seeking world domination and does it with the bonus of the camaraderie between watson and holmes whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble save the world themes of this movie or not i think they are right on i find that they only add to the flavor and fun of this fine old adventure film that holds up to repeated viewings i rate it a pleasant 83 100 points
