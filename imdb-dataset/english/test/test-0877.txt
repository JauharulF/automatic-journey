<START> never been kissed starring drew as reporter josie gellar is a sweet extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named josie gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school only problem is josie has never been popular high school was in fact a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes josie grabs this assignment as much to finally fit in as to get a scoop what she finds is the major premise of the story br br never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie it is however very sweetly done drew is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely josie she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic i also enjoyed leelee as the intellectual student who befriends josie on her first day at the school br br never been kissed has some really funny moments as josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool example the reggae bar scene i also loved the appearance of brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student the way that he helps to give josie her dream of finally fitting in is just hilarious at the same time as woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to josie to be affected by her story drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore josie from the beginning br br there is a lot of mean girls a 2004 release in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together br br i liked this movie it was really beautifully done in some areas the movie is corny in some places yes the last scene realistic no way does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way oh yeah yeah yeah baby but it manipulates beautifully there are some lessons to be learned here the movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to josie i've met people very much like all these characters i think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school and how hurtful it can be but it's there not unrealistic at all what struck me was drew's speech at the prom as she demonstrates the sheep mentality that can exist so as hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be it was well done and very true br br i'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture it's engaging sweetly acted and just rufus i'd say check it out 8 of 10
<START> cia analyst douglas freeman gyllenhaal gets to see his first secret location interrogation when anwar is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker wife witherspoon is frantic regarding the whereabouts of her husband br br don't you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary i must have an old edition as this rendition is not a musical piece no it's the government's way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information br br while watching this movie i was reminded of a similar story line in the crossing jordan tv show now off the air and i expect we will see even more of these story lines it's inevitable the events of 911 are the br br this is a tough one to watch because we don't like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things we like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers but when that door is closed to us we are truly lost and without hope as wife was br br performances by all were first class and it's possible we may see more of i have no idea how to pronounce it because he resembles and can act like telly savalas no kidding br br violence yes sex no nudity no language yes
<START> lifeforce was one of cannon films' biggest flops it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe hooper's career in the wake of the spielberg poltergeist controversy all of this is unfortunate because lifeforce is actually a really great movie it is supremely entertaining moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over the top direction production performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen it must have looked bizarre on paper the producers of the delta force the screenwriter of alien the director of the texas chainsaw massacre the composer of breakfast at tiffany's the special effects wizards of star wars audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness br br what more do you want we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats we got a sexy naked space vampiress sucking out people's souls we got exploding bodies we got zombies we got possession we got an s m interrogation we got the entire city of london on fire it's dracula meets night of the living dead meets and the pit meets earthquake it's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror sci fi comedy action disaster erotic apocalyptic epic ever unleashed that is if there are any other ones out there br br try watching this movie while chemically altered perhaps then you'll understand a genuinely f ed up experience and one of director tobe hooper's most underrated movies maybe one day it will find its audience
<START> i adored this but i am an 80's kid i loved rainbow bright my whole childhood i don't know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show mine wasn't but thats okay i bought it for me anyway i just brought the little one so the guy at the checkout stand wouldn't look at me funny i love the non violent drama and the colorful scenery it just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show although i may be just a little biased on the subject afterall i was rainbow bright 6 years in a row for halloween i wonder if they make a rainbow bright costume for adults lol
<START> i think this movie is different apart from most films i've seen it was exciting in a way and no matter what others say i say i was surprised about the final solution certainly didn't see it coming although it's sad it's worth watching i can't think of any movie that would be like this actors knew what they were doing if you say this movie sucks you say probably what most people would say but if someone says that this movie is ordinary i absolutely don't agree and norman reedus should be more noticed br br maybe i'm freak but i liked this very much it was kind of mess but who cares i'm tired of boring and ordinary movies
<START> the greatest tragedy man faces is that capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal from this fact does so much great tragedy emerge death in venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head on it confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms self denial and decay undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema its refined look echoey sound mixture of languages and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director the central performance at once rigid aroused and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence highlights bogarde as if not the best british actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous able to hold on to sympathy as his desires take him over and interesting despite the endless close ups and score playing above him not one for a friday night with your girlfriend but certainly ok if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation
<START> the brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process which is a conventional but executed intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post wwii but in the fact that this story was told at all samuel goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands an alcoholic and an underachiever
<START> please why on earth did bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap br br to begin with we the viewers at home are treated to a narration from some unknown ding bat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankind's triumph over the demons yeah right br br i can tell you right now that this doesn't in anyway what so ever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether bava as usual makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set oh god i'm not going to go on go see for yourself br br as usual you'll be treated to laughable dubbing crap scenarios that don't make any sense and above all un answered questions how typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crap br br overall if you're one of those dvd collector's then maybe you'll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague it's no way near the first so you may wanna avoid like the plague
<START> don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one it is but that does not a good film make br br comedies require a well honed script and masterful direction sadly this poorly executed film has neither a good director in other genres does not deliver in his comedic farces les series being another example br br the comedic timing is terrible some jokes are telegraphed some are re hashed from other movies others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh the plot has messy subplots the allergic daughter the lesbian co owner and just does not develop or envelope the viewer it isn't funny and it isn't believable for a second br br compare this to any comedy by billy wilder some like it hot a foreign etc or by francis veber a true genius at french comedy le diner de cons le placard les la la grande blonde etc and you'll see the difference in their tight scripts great comedic acting and timing with each joke leading to the next one br br watching mon ami twice would be cruel and unusual punishment not a good sign for a comedy
<START> kramer vs kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same they can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by justin henry br br what i really did like about kramer vs kramer it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents dustin hoffman and meryl streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature though the film is slanted in hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son he's not presented as any kind of saint nor is streep a completely black villain hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game he's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations still it's a big shock to him when streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out she also wants out of being a mother at least for a while br br hoffman and henry make do the best they can the pressure of being both parents causes hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency at that point after over a year streep decides she wants custody br br both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully but in these situations the tie is always broken in favor of the mother br br dustin hoffman and meryl streep won their first of two oscars respectively for this film her in the supporting actress category i'm not sure how these things are decided streep does get less screen time than hoffman if that's the determining factor the film does focus on hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure as for meryl it's a choice for her as it is for many women to balance a career and motherhood the conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen br br dustin hoffman may have won that oscar partly for the same reason that spencer tracy picked up his first by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and henry is great because he comes over as a real kid not a hollywood kid i wonder if hoffman saw captains courageous and saw how spencer tracy dealt with freddie bartholomew dustin could have done a lot worse than channel spencer tracy in his performance br br kramer vs kramer also won oscars for best picture best director for robert benton and best adapted screenplay it's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child don't miss it if ever broadcast
<START> just saw this movie yesterday night and i almost cried no it wasn't because it got me utterly petrified no it was absolutely horrendous sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future this movie is one of those it's as though the writer actors director et al just came together and copied and pasted scenes of their favorite horror flicks zipped it all together and said hey here's satan's whip after seeing this movie i could not help but be tormented by the sight of people whom call themselves actors waltzing around like they're some kind of talented artistic interpreters do not be fooled they suck don't bother wasting your time or money
<START> this was hitchcock's third hollywood feature and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930s br br hitchcock's formal method on the other hand had by now settled into something consistent so much so that he was unable or at least unwilling to deviate from it it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content in other words hitchcock was no ernst lubitsch br br first let's look at the romantic angle the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild passionate and slightly dangerous Â the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have situation and he was great at depicting that this is something that makes a much earlier film rich and strange one of the few hitchcock non thrillers that really works hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story a light tender touch is required and hitch doesn't have it br br secondly take the comedy of course hitchcock films could be funny Â the lady vanishes is probably the best example Â but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story the master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller Â snappy opposing angles of people talking inserted close ups of hands and feet point of view shots Â but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags for example the business with carole lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close ups but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point and have no comedic impact occasionally hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy Â for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive sophisticated woman at the next table Â but such moments are few and far between br br even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard i'm not sure this was robert montgomery's strength lay and he is boring here this was of course exactly where queen of screwball carole lombard's strength lay and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances even jack carson who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera fails to perk things up at all of course neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place even if the basic story is a fairly good premise br br the only full on comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour when the basic framework was suspense Â as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot Â that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well
<START> george scott gave the performance of a lifetime in paddy the hospital a very dark drama about an aging big city hospital and a middle aged physician on the verge of suicide along comes diana rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself their dialog crackles and it is clear they are made for each other from the outset but will she save him their one sex scene is both graphic and memorable for its passion and fury meanwhile the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who don't want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center and a serial killer is loose in the hospital specializing in doctors and nurses a good part of the movie though is squarely focused on scott as it should be what a difference a few years made back when this movie was made 1962 had given us the interns a hokey old fashioned reworking of dr with terrible acting and a cardboard script along came 1971 and the hospital less than 10 years later hollywood did something right for a change watching the hospital today is a reminder of how much medical shows like st elsewhere and scrubs owe to this enduring classic and if the hospital reminds you of network it should same scripter
<START> 1st watched 6 21 2001 2 out of 10 dir emmanuel itier pretty much worthless supposed thriller that spends more time drawing us into sexual encounters with and without the star smith ' it tries to wrap a story around the sex scenes but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well i was so bored with this movie that i actually fast forwarded thru the ending to get it over with the video version i watched was called 'tell me no lies '
<START> the actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast the quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there the screenplay is intense and does not wander the plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending we showed this film to a small group of patrons at center for cultural arts after the film ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered while we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film i would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation
