<START> many years ago i saw this movie on television maybe and loved it so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation it did br br set in notorious king's cross district where prostitution drug abuse and sex stores thrive it tells the story of jimmy played by heath ledger jimmy is a young man maybe late teens or thereabouts who hasn't had a stable family background he is on the fringes of society and works as a for a sex club encouraging people to enter the store he is aware of an underworld figure called who is a local bigwig in the cross it's jimmy's hope that he will find himself on radar and get 'in' with him a short cut to upward social mobility he hopes br br one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex played by the charming rose byrne you just know that a love story will play out between them on that night as well jimmy is first contacted by played by bryan brown has a for jimmy it's the in the door' that jimmy has been waiting for br br to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer stylistically if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies you should be in tune with what to expect twists and turns and black comedy br br what's so great about this movie is its very it's no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie but a genuine australian contribution to the genre br br a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they're doing there in the end all these ends' tie together beautifully it's sort of like a celluloid strip br br a highlight of the movie is bryan brown's character of likes puzzles and it's fun to see him play games with his cronies it's the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable his taste in music for starters br br of the heath ledger movies i have seen the dark knight 10 things i hate about you this is perhaps his best role wasn't taken with 10 things if you are a heath ledger fan ledger recently died a tragic accidental death this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role i think there is great chemistry between ledger and byrne in this movie so on one level it functions as nice love story br br this movie doesn't have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies but it does have some adult themes scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty in that sense it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers but it's not a movie that gore hounds will get excited about either br br lastly i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknesses i e it has a great story great acting and a great script we need more popular quality movies like this to be made here in australia br br highly recommended other australian movies i have loved include br br breaker morant 10 10 mad max 2 10 10 my brilliant career not reviewed here by me yet proof nr the devil's playground nr the year my voice broke nr bad boy bubby nr a great dark comedy the dish nr a great charming comedy
<START> some movies are just Â unlucky these are the films that obviously thrived on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas but simply didn't have the budgetary means and or professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen the strangeness definitely belongs in this category you really want to like it but even the most tolerant and undemanding 80's horror fanatics will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of cheapness clumsy stop motion effects and dark cinematography the strangeness has a fairly original plot and setting okay it's similar to the boogens but i sincerely doubt that director david michael hillman intentionally ripped off a fellow insignificant 80's b movie and the players deliver enthusiast performances even though they're all miscast an assembly of amateur go on an expedition to explore the infamous gold spike mine many years ago several miners mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned ever since but there's supposed to be too much gold hidden there to remain closed forever shortly after they descended into the mine the group members one by one encounter the slimy ruler of the gold spike mine a lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward throughout most of its running time the strangeness is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting the characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the helmets of the there's very little action or horror to experience in the first hour but director hillman cleverly grasps the viewers' attention by showing bits and pieces of the monster at regular intervals as soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle you're doomed to keep watching till the very end the creature is realized with stop motion effects which i usually adore and worship but here in this case they look extremely weak and pitiable the person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of ray the death sequences largely occur off screen and there's very little suspense throughout the whole movie a horror flick with a setting like this should benefice from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects but the strangeness lacks all this the biggest trump of the film is unquestionably the beautiful appearance of blond actress terri she resembles a as much as i resemble mother theresa but she surely looks good in her tight white top and beige pants
<START> a confusing senseless script with plot holes the size of the tower terrible acting by all involved no exception laughable and cheesy dialogue lame attempts at humor and romance extremely cheap special effects all this makes for a giant mess of a film you'd best avoid
<START> gulliver ted danson is a doctor who goes missing at sea leaving pregnant wife mary mary steenburgen behind eight years later he turns up disheveled and seemingly mad babbling about his adventures in the lands of the tiny the giant the floating island of the intellectual laputa and the a race of intelligent talking horses who have to deal with the yahoos a race of bestial humans among many other adventures the not so good dr bates james fox who has designs on wife has gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution and mary and son thomas tom must find a way to prove his sanity br br a splendid adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical novel this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels the story the satire the characters the visuals the brilliant cast it's simply a treat to watch and it's almost amazing considering that it was a made for tv film br br the film does a brilliant job of capturing swift's vicious satire which cuts like a hatchet through british society of the time but still resonates today the wise and the are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why gulliver speaks with such pride of the vices and of his society the scenes where gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the yahoos are perhaps the best with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders they seem to pick the worst among them who rules until they find someone even worse go to war we only go to war for a very good reason such as they are weaker than us or we want all of their land etc the scenes involving laputa are also effectively done the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else and really possess little common sense and the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly dr bates is truly nasty character and when he gives a speech to the inquiry on gulliver's alleged vices it's quite clear that he's describing his own faults br br the film makes use of beautiful and fairly convincing cgi effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect the contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way the cinematography particularly that concerning the asylum and the costumes are brilliantly done the editing of the present with memories is a device which could be awkward but works very well br br the cast is truly wonderful a veritable who's who of british and american talent ted danson gives an excellent multi layered performance as gulliver showing effectively his transformation from a person bewildered by his strange surroundings to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears to his rational intellectual personality at the end most well known for his work on sit com danson shows that he's more than just sam malone with this wonderful serio comic performance mary steenburgen is effective as his wife and james fox is absolutely repulsive as bates the rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos with peter o'toole omar sharif warwick davis kristin scott thomas geraldine chaplin alfre woodward edward fox and sir john gielgud being the most memorable but even the smallest parts are very well played br br while not 100 faithful to the book gulliver's travels is a triumph of story and images it's not to be missed br br 9 10
<START> my 10 10 rating of course applies only if you're willing to get completely and utterly grossed out because you know that only john waters can do that in pink flamingos his directorial debut he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive what divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question but even aside from that the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine you had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie even some of the lines are rather mind blowing br br otherwise avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus
<START> this movie is an obvious rip off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson you owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense i'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline with everyone else getting killed all through the movie i wondered why frank didn't just blow johnny's brains out he certainly could have and johnny sure didn't act like someone that could be trusted another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes why do these people have sex with their clothes on is that supposed to turn us on surely they didn't think they had a shot at a pg rating nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally as if one were watching people in real life instead it was done in a heavy handed and shallow manner
<START> for anyone who has ever sought happiness half empty is a must see this original cross cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers which make the producers seem boringly staid writer bob patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life wisdom and happiness even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out ending their relationship when his book on happiness north star finds zero success in the states his publishers send him to germany for a book signing tour while explaining their decision to bob the boardroom erupts into a rousing song which would make monty python proud from his arrival in hamburg bob's complete ignorance of the german language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage however he soldiers on impervious of his hosts true feelings towards him until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction toward him br br the original songs propel the film often describing the subtext of the story in side splitting precision the cast led by robert peters exhibit an immaculately dry sense of humor and inhabit their characters as if they were not acting see it for a case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant how merciless americans abroad are viewed how little reason it takes to burst into song and above all for a silly entertaining unconventional laugh
<START> i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slasher gore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent with penny definitely the best of the bunch rachael taylor looks like a young christie but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that kane was good as the killer and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut i saw the twist coming from miles away but i still enjoyed the movie br br but what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him aside from the horror film speed cam you know where like the guy's face shakes all fast there's some good shots here the camera angles and environments really emphasize kane's size making him look even bigger than he actually is br br if you're looking for deep story or characters this ain't it but that's not what slasher films are about if you're looking for some good violence or if you're into gory films go check this out
<START> italians movie makers love to rip off american movies all of our movies and as often as possible br br i'm not stating that as a slur against italy as a whole but i would like to further observe that the italian film industry does itself great harm by allowing like this to go overseas to be seen by the world at large that's all i'm saying br br and no more grave injury do the italian people subject themselves to than by not sticking a harsh penalty upon those who made the world watch shark rosso which is admittedly a ripoff of the far superior jaws as if you didn't know br br let's dive into the plot get it haw haw this huge monstrous swimming thing that looks like a cross between an octopus a shark and steven tyler attacks many innocent americans ie italians off the coast of florida ie italy and the intrepid beer swilling peter sails out with his anorexic beer swilling girlfriend and other beer swilling people whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature killed by mysterious forces who want the creature left alone or just stand around and be otherwise useless and swill beer or be the doctor in this film who dying patients repeatedly 20 maybe 30 times in a row without waiting for his paddles to must be one heck of a good battery there doc br br then there's the monster brother if you thought the jaws shark was fake look herein and have your mind changed immediately br br this is a movie that was directed as an afterthought by a bava edited with an onion chopper acted by beer swilling pieces of driftwood and written by presumably beer swilling people who should never ever ever ever be let near a typewriter movie studio or major city in the world ever again if this is how the people who made this film think real people act in such a situation they've obviously made one too many of them zombie movies or too much beer br br need i say this movie is bad it is bad like green cottage cheese bad like a hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding bad like the bad theatre skits dan aykroyd used to host on saturday night live bad like calista weight gain get it good br br mike and the sol gang slap this beer drunk beauty upside the head repeatedly and reveal this horror film as what it is horrible though with a certain european charm it's charming when watched by a european preferably a beer swilling one br br no stars for the waterlogged dead fish known as shark rosso six stars for the mst3k version and now anyone for a beer br br
<START> there ought to be some kind of prosecution to punish producers from financing screenplays this stupid i feel that some kind of of bad film might prevent more films this idiotic from being made sure it has an interesting cast of characters but i don't think i've ever seen a more cardboard performance from an entire cast as in this uniquely crappy piece of crap that director ought to be punished somehow for not eliciting at least some kind of performance out of these people so detachment is a theme no really they'll beat you over the head with this one it doesn't mean every character has to recite their lines as if they on npr did i mention this movie was crappy lastly i'm not sure what connection one's memories would have with terminal bone cancer but i'm reasonably certain if you were totally brain dead your cancer would continue to grow regardless this movie is an insult to cancer patients medical professionals and non retarded people oh and lastly fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by beating their wings just like every other flying insect i absolutely despise people presenting false knowledge as fact next time do a little research before using an imbecilic misconception as a premise for an entire freaking movie just kidding believe in jesus
<START> john carpenter's the thing is hands down the best horror film ever made not only that but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time what makes the movie so great it's hard to put my finger on it everything just seems to work in the thing it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place the film is even superior to alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell the fact that it's not only about the gore which is wonderful btw but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films a truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs and anyone who has good taste in films
<START> her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role her face remained too white hair too clothes etc too clean and well fitting especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where comes home for any sense of accuracy it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect too but she was the only one who didn't get messy there was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek are we to believe she was the only person in the civil war with a bathtub and a mirror she certainly looked like the only one who used them tweezers too i mean what's with those eyebrows she looked absolutely mean br br the love story was implausible she only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute so she goes over to tease him then flirts with him a couple more times and suddenly this is a love on a par with odysseus and penelope please br br i should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us the english patient my reaction to that one was the same as on seinfeld it sucked
<START> i was very curious about anatomy aka anatomie and if i was going to see it i was going to have to buy it since no video stores in my area carried the film since it was not a low priced dvd i did take a chance and thought i'd take a peek at other comments on imdb many of the comments didn't give me enough hope of forking out lots of bucks for a film i had never seen nor had any clues about i basically got the idea it was a sexy youth oriented romp being compared to many cookie cutter teen thrillers well something in the back of my mind told me to ignore those types of comments and buy it i did and was i pleasantly surprised br br if it is going to be compared to any other films i would say it's a variation of coma and extreme measures i couldn't see any comparison to films like scream urban legends et al yes the cast is young that's because they're med students at least they aren't the increasingly boring high school type characters and yes some are lusty basically the character played by anna loos is and it is handled quite tastefully in the german language version but anatomy is well constructed there is a tense mood throughout the sets are amazing the makeup effects are a wow and franka potente is very credible in her role i found myself enjoying all of it despite a few gaping holes in the plot the story of a student discovering a sort of secret society doing autopsies on still living patients is a rather creepy scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever sure you could ask why didn't she just get out of that town okay but then the film would be over within a half hour br br this was the first effort from the german part of columbia pictures and it's actually quite an impressive one there was a bit of care in the production and to actually offer some genuine thrills is an accomplishment it is a bit mature in mind as it doesn't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters a breast fest or juvenile drug jokes anna loos' character while often making sexual remarks and looking for some fun was actually a nice touch having a character that was a woman more intelligent than any of the men in the school she found that sex was really just a distraction for her and the men rather lacking br br the important stuff watching this film in the original german language with english or french subtitles is the best way to enjoy it i saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in english and was disgusted by the change it made in the film's tone i have never seen a properly dubbed film in my life they never can find voices that suit the film's actors or characters sure enough i tried to watch some of anatomy dubbed in english and the intelligence level of it dropped severely making it seem more like a comedy a good example is when one guy was freaked out at being cut open and screamed to be sewn back up hearing it in german he sounded frantic but dubbed in english he sounded like a comedian frankly i'm sick of hearing people say they can't handle reading subtitles or watch a letterboxed film anatomy comes off as silly with dubbed voices that seem octaves too high for any of the people you see in the film and anna loos' sexual comments then just sound like awful remarks right out of fast times at ridgemont high i wonder if the negative comments about anatomy are from people who watched it dubbed it just doesn't seem like the same film at all this is not a cheap horror film and deserves to be viewed as it was created interesting to note that some of the english subtitles are different in scenes in the feature and the making of supplement br br as it turns out i gambled and won with anatomy it's a competent thriller with likeable characters and doesn't try to go for cheap thrills
<START> this is one of the most unoriginal cliche ridden movies i have ever seen even if you didn't like this film's antecedents 'the bad news bears' and 'the mighty ducks ' they are bound to have done a better job than this one from the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her don't bother with us we're all losers you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film br br all the usual suspects are here besides the spunky teacher we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids they're brats yes but no so endearing a slow witted small town sheriff that they love to torment an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team etc ad nauseum only olivia d'abo as the new teacher displays any i never cared much for steve guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things jay o sanders is a capable actor but his character the rival coach leaves him nothing to work with let's hope that writer director holly goldberg sloan comes up with something better next time out
<START> i've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen the netherlands it impressed me so much that i kept on smiling the whole day after i watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when i took the movie as the final taste of the festival what i knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renÃ©e zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera star but what i saw was much more than that splendid roles for morgan freeman chris rock renÃ©e zellweger a strange mix of romance violence and roadmovie and for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track many soap opera lovers will love 'nurse betty' the movie as well as the character but they can bring all there non soap friends 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines freeman and rock for the cruel scenes the thriller aspects and for the beautiful pictures and i'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm
