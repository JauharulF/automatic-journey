<START> this interesting lost film written by terence malick stars stacy keach and frederic forrest as two wacky southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant margot kidder was never prettier and forrest should have been nominated originally titled the dion brothers this light hearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy br br where is this film i've been searching for it for 30 years keach was still great back then and i'm surprised it doesn't have more of a cult following maybe it does these guys are a crack up with more ambition than brains but totally lovable dudes a 7 out of 10 if you can dig it up somewhere you'll have fun
<START> laura fraser creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and he's suddenly brought to life of course oh what jolly japes don't ensue in a britcom flop so day glo bright yet so dismal it manages to make the execrable 1980s american teen flick weird science look almost decent the sex obsessed script is by the sun film critic nick fisher a former teeny mag who's obviously never watched an episode of smack the pony in his life shame because then he might at least have been in with a shout of writing female characters that were recognisably members of the human race this knicker twisting lot have all too clearly emerged from the virtual brain of someone who imagines they're amusing suddenly the thought of new wave iranian cinema is somehow attractive
<START> i loved this movie but then again i am a big cronenberg fan if you have not seen a david cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start scanners the fly rabid would be a place to start and then work up to videodrome before checking this one out this is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond br br in this game the players plug a bio engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system it is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget it is full of cronenberg's slimy body works dark foreboding scenery all populated by a great cast including jennifer jason leigh jude law and willem dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously these people will do what they can to figure out the game and then to win at it like other movies of his there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat but like an auto accident you don't look away if you liked any of the movies mentioned above then by all means go out and get this one
<START> much better than expected good family flick catch it on reruns the whole is more than the sum of its parts paul giamatti chews up the scenery he has way more talent then the role deserves a treat to watch inspector from the illusionist go over the top the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches the cameos were particular fun for the parents nice to see lee majors and umm again it's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting i normally can't stand frankie but he is just fine here hats off to the casting director if only for hiring giamatti
<START> not for the first time i'm out of kilter with the majority view oz is a dreadful pretentious voyeuristic series the makers have their cake and eat it oz em city etc are used as ultra crude signals that the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy this allows viewers the of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beings br br when you watch an episode please remember that while the foul mouthed violent absurdly convoluted unconvincing sick imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water br br oz is exploitative drama at its worst it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful it blows hot and cold and changes from to more often than a symphony br br dialogue is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian the liberties taken with realities are stupid here's a nightclub owning dandy arriving at oz in his foppish finery complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye brandishing a stash of drugs that nobody detected here's a murderous wimp bleating about the heat death of the universe begging to be killed but of course being refused by the brute he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himself br br the action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic dim witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown don't worry a betrayal a murder a sex scene will be along within a minute or two br br finally oz is obviously pretentious you don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow you can watch it and tell yourself that the producers writers and actors are doing everything with a huge wink or same word but for a change of vowel to the audience br br yes you can be a nasty minded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the cleverness post modernistic etc skills of the oz production team they appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane br br truly a despicable series and every hour it shows rewarding its makers and actors and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible successful widely praised series
<START> sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good this movie was made in germany and is dubbed in english so you have to get past that the acting also was stilted and forced other than what was done by the real rats who imo did an excellent job of acting the part snaps to the rat wrangler anyway the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere this storyline has been used before not to mention has happened in real life too often unfortunately and the audience is not in for any surprises but this is fine we know what's going to happen and when and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along we have our hero down to the chiseled face and body the semi hero s and of course our heroine who happens to be the doctor but only still in training though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying and not just from a rat bite of course the villain must die okay all the villains meaning the rats and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works this is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not
<START> ripe is one of those awful indies which manages to get into circulation and give indies a bad name telling a stupidly incongruous tale of pubescent twin sisters who crawl from a firey car crash which kills their parents and then hit the road while happily shoplifting making goo goo eyes at some guy and ending up on an army post so dilapidated no army would want it yeah right an apparent attempt at a coming of age flick ripe is an almost complete loser which wanders aimlessly as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with nary a shred of credibility to be found anywhere not recommended for anyone
<START> this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb armand assante once again doing a poor stallone imitation is ray wellman a ex con just out on parole all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy played by a young marcia gay harden back unfortunately for ray lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot played by sam neill further complicating matters is that ray's old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen ray and elliot team up despite mutual dislike br br what follows is violent and slow but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future she's not as polished here but her raw emotion sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching almost br br rent fever no the title doesn't fit the film if your a fan of hers otherwise skip it and be grateful it's stars went on to better things br br note this is a hard r flick for language violence and nudity
<START> paul tempest interesting odd and strange movie about a mid life crisis set in nyc and a remote greek island with john cassavettes as world renowned architect who decides to drop out he is accompanied by his daughter molly ringwald and a lounge singer susan sarandon a beautiful transfer of this 25 year old movie on the dvd but without any extras not even the theatrical trailer tons of great scenery and razor sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip raul julia and gena rowlands round out a strong cast a good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near insanity this recent dvd release is worth renting b
<START> i saw this at the san francisco independent film festival and liked it a lot it worked for me as a slightly weird comedy because i don't like horror but there were only a couple of minutes i had to close my eyes br br the dialog was good the costumes and settings were not far off bbc quality which is amazing for an indie film i liked the way the plot twists and even meanders it kept surprising me in good ways i even warmed up to the willy character who i quite disliked at the beginning it would have been better if there'd been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island that felt very much like a plot device br br i am fond of dominic monaghan and he did a good job at pratfalls horror and at the more thoughtful moments nice voice in the narration too br br this would be a fun and unusual date movie
<START> this was the best movie ever has seen on cine club buenos aires this movie is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century it cause a very good impression to all the partners of cine club i recommend this movie to all the fans of troma and to all the people who like the good movies not the commercial movies
<START> this is another of my favorite columbos it sports a top notch cast including john cassavetes who was never or sexier comer myrna loy and blythe danner now here's something i've always wondered had paltrow been born when this episode was shot or was danner pregnant at the time thanks to imdb i have my answer she was five pregnant now i can really feel ancient br br cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to danner was apparently to use the social connections of her mother loy he has a mistress on the side comer a prominent pianist but she announces she wants more she's sick of being back street on the night of their concert he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide columbo picks up a few problems immediately one thing he notices you have a beautiful woman here bedroom eyes she has money a body and a career where's the man it's wonderful to see falk and good friend cassavetes together there's a very funny episode at the vet with columbo's bassett everyone in the cast is great br br this is one of the episodes that made columbo the classic series it became
<START> i haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater and i have been searching for it since at the time i was 12 and the story excited me and now the ending eludes me it was young love that engrossed me the most not to mention john's vocals and lyrics the story at the time hit home to my psyche i am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years it is that good place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run if this movie didn't excite your curiosity then you were just too old i look forward to seeing it again even at my age if nostalgia is in your venue i'm sure this is an interesting movie to see it's innocence is simply astounding and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable
<START> i'm not sure what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this poor excuse for a film but whatever they thought of didn't help this movie it only hurt it and it hurt this film badly the acting for once isn't the problem it's the horrible editing scenes will end for no apparent reason while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in mid sentence i'm not sure what the story was but it didn't really matter since what i did see was fairly uninteresting just bad all around a huge jaws rip off and not a good one at that the mst version was funny though 7 for that none for the film itself
<START> overall this is entertaining and odd film don't try to make sense of it there are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with but robert cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this fugitive like story br br unlike the popular tv show and then 1993 movie this fugitive isn't looking for a one armed man but a two armed nazi saboteur by the the name of frank fry cummings barry kane gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in los angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it fry to clear his name br br the first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting then priscilla lane pat martin enters the story and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog director alfred hitchcock often did that with his female characters to the point i wonder if he had a clue how woman talked lane's character here was a little lame br br actually the villains played by otto kruger charles tobin and norman lloyd frank fry were the best in my opinion just fascinating acting and dialog was especially good br br if you haven't seen this film but saw hitchcock's well known north by northwest you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it instead of a climactic scene at mount rushmore here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the state of liberty as usual hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view
