<START> i just rented this movie from the video store last night it being new and not released long ago here the rent was only overnight me my little sis and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically even my brother this movie is hilarious i actually laughed no matter how funny some movies are even if i think its funny i sometimes can't seem to laugh but this movie i laughed my brother ended up thinking it was the best that type of movie he had seen i ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later
<START> is by far my second favorite comedy of all time first being namak halal even though that was technically a drama story is nothing groundbreaking but the complications that are added to it make it awesome aamir khan is a total cartoon just watch his expressions in the song yeh raat aur yeh he is amazingly good at comedy i never knew salman khan was also good as the somewhat of the two characters the noises he makes are almost as funny as faces raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing the real pick of the lot is paresh rawal as usual br br the plot is rather simple amar aamir and prem salman are useless sons of poor fathers they don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way so both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's paresh rawal daughter raveena tandon who comes to india to look for a husband so amar and prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl when they succeed they now have to get rid of each other somehow both of them get into house amar as an injured guy and prem as his doctor from here on they try to oust each other but things are complicated as friend karisma kapoor falls for prem and pursues him and rich man's evil twin brother rawal also tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work br br this is a movie you do not want to miss watch it it will be worth it i even own the dvd its that good and if you like this movie i'd also recommend gol if you haven't already watched it other good comedies are namak halal and hera pheri new
<START> this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly 1936 1959 is a tour de force for gary busey the movie's highlights are busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings holly songs he brings such energy to the performances that holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved br br the film follows holly's career from growing up in texas to stardom and new york and his untimely death in a plane crash one thing i found interesting if true was buddy's driving ambition he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing as young as he was he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level we will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like the rolling stones br br the lyrics of many of holly's songs are pretty adolescent read the lyrics for peggy sue or oh boy and you will see what i mean maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences but his instrumentation and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to follow both the rolling stones and the beatles have acknowledged his importance br br clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect for example i doubt that holly ever punched out a producer in nashville or that the audience at new york's apollo theater was so immediately responsive as to be wildly dancing in the aisles if you are interested in getting closer to the truth see the documentary the real buddy holly story 1985 that is produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging paul mccartney this contains interviews with holly's family friends and band mates holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in the buddy holly story members of other bands like keith richards and don everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old holly performances the mccartney production can stand on its own but it makes an excellent companion piece to the buddy holly story and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the fictionalized story
<START> could possibly be the worst film ever made at least plan 9 from outer space was funny i can't believe they talked someone into actually putting up money to make this thing complete waste of celluloid before i saw this crap i had some respect for i guess somebody needed a tax write off please in the name of all that which does not suck stop whoever made this before they suck again this movie should be avoided by all people who are not on lsd or my crazy cousin that insists we're part native american if you are in the woods and an owl starts talking to you see a psychiatrist it is not necessary to make a movie about it
<START> to call this film a disaster will be an understatement i don't even know where to begin i have questions though and lots of them i would like to know who conceived of this script who gave them money to make this film who was in charge of casting and costuming they should all be sued i saw this film in my local library's catalog and i thought hey great i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version unbeknowst to me that it would turn out to be a total and utter crap fest br br the fog is a film about four friends actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends one of them is a beauty queen played by india's 1st mrs world and the director spares no expense at letting you know this the script even claims that she the character's name is has aishwarya rai eyes kareena kapoor lips and rani mukherjee hair feel free to barf if you want to at least at this point you haven't seen the film unlike poor me br br anyway receives a death threat one day from one of the uncle who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning but boyfriend doesn't allow her to do this and thus she participates in the pageant and wins this causes the crack cocaine sniffing uncle of her former college classmate tanya to come after her but with the help of her cousin drowns the culprit and they enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body it's tough but they eventually get around to doing it br br in a scene that borrows from hollywood's film diabolique the pool where the dead body is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a conundrum of whodunit and where is it by the time the film is over the film successful steals scenes from 'i know what you did last summer i still know scream 1 scream 2 scream 3 murder she wrote episodes and not to mention columbo and scooby doo' shameless i tell ya br br inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to br br 1 a scantily clad answers phone calls three times from her would be killer the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer br br 2 tanya tries to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest wtf even aishwarya rai who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didn't win miss india br br 3 in the pool scene the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive and the ball disappears too br br 4 the clichÃ© blue contacts lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene yet when his corpse surfaces again his eyes are blue br br 5 nobody who dies in the film is mourned strange especially for indian society br br 6 when jumps into the dirty murky pool an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day br br 7 sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo orgasm drenched song and dance number about coming of age that would have been cool for some bachelor party but they were celebrating pageant win hello br br 8 kunal sameer and can neither dance nor lip synch properly but don't blame them just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers br br 9 nothing within the film was choreographed it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want br br 10 the film played out like there was no script either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk br br 11 when picture was published without her consent in a magazine she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested yet she receives death threats and never bothers to alert the police br br just to mention a few of course this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film making
<START> my yardstick for measuring a movie's watch ability is if i get squirmy if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boring br br all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the coast guard too they are definitely under appreciated until the day your boat sinks that is br br the movie was very enjoyable and fun kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit however i was most impressed by ashton performance i have never liked him never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature well punk in this film he does a great job he is well on his way to having leading man status i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 2 3 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback particularly on the parts of the film we didn't like br br possible spoiler the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning kevin costner comes home to see his wife ward packing her stuff up and moving out he says maybe i should be the one to move out and she replies no you don't know where anything is in this house i should be the one to go this doesn't make sense if she knows the layout so well costner is right he should be the one to leave
<START> alex benedict john cassavetes is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist when she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide too bad for him our rumpled detective lt columbo peter falk is on the case br br stephen bochco has written another razor sharp episode for the series following marvelous detail with marvelous detail we watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty five minutes and we're completely engrossed then when columbo appears on the scene it gets even better br br we first see columbo after the murder as per usual this time he's at the vet with his new dog scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show think columbo's discomfort over the nude model in suitable for framing columbo is hilarious when he's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non suspects bochco by contrast shows columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story and i'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to columbo's quest to give the dog a name as far as we learn the dog remains nameless bochco gives columbo some of his best moments in this episode and peter falk makes the most of them he's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist and he's even better in his scenes playing cat and mouse with cassavetes that these two long time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected and that's what we get notice how alex benedict can't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted columbo even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck br br bochco makes the most of every situation in his script when columbo goes to question snooty mechanic of course Â of course Â he asks the man to look at his own beat up heap and when benedict finds columbo at the hollywood bowl before rehearsal of course Â of course Â he's on the piano playing chopsticks and what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim's typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller br br columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl dawn frame and the lovely blythe danner who plays cassavetes's wife it's nice to see myrna loy show up as mother though she does little with her minor role br br the director nicholas who also acted most notably as coach in cheers does a perfectly creditable job though he follows the lead of nearly every other columbo director by adding one or two silly flourishes scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus then there's that bit where cassavetes sees the he dropped at the scene of the crime Â and we see a zoom in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses there's also one scene with myrna loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except cassavetes br br these are quibbles though this is a splendidly entertaining episode the kind that made me a columbo fan
<START> in many ways the filmic career of independent film making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock the consummate studio director where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed immaculately cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally hitchcock's tales were always plot first narratives with the human element put in the background cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films if some things did not make much sense logically so be it br br one can see this even from his very first film 1959's shadows filmed with a 16mm hand held camera on a shoe string budget of about 40 000 in manhattan with cassavetes' acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film the story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites benny ben carruthers a trumpeter and no account hugh hugh hurd a washed up singer and lelia lelia goldoni the younger sister of both the film's three main arcs deal with hugh's failures as a nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager rupert rupert benny's in an about manhattan with his two no account pals and lovelife first with a white boy tony anthony ray who does not realize light skinned race even after bedding her then with stiff and proper jones who may be a misogynist br br in the first arc nothing much happens except dark skinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts he dreams of making it big in new york or even paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows he's a marginal talent at best that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work but this is the least important of the three while this film is better overall than say martin scorsese's first film a decade later who's that knocking at my door another tale of failed romance and frustrated new yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments acting wise nor cinematographically that that film has it also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era manhattan exteriors at ground level is a gem to relive while shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willy nilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle all in all it's a very sloppy job especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working style br br the national film registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as this is all in keeping with the credo of art cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote 'i've never seen an exploding helicopter i've never seen anybody go and blow somebody's head off so why should i make films about them but i have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way i've seen people withdraw i've seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and i've myself done all these things so i can understand them what we are saying is so gentle it's gentleness we have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems ' that this film is is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being it is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives
<START> if you are a catalan nationalist socialist with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the spanish republic this movie may be for you two brothers real life ones one of them being marc himself re enact a fictional version of a real life journey they had made through the spectacular catalan countryside and history is evoked pans of bullet holed walls artillery booms on the soundtrack but not shown there is very little dialog and most of it is incidental the story is told in a third person voice over the voice being that of an actress impersonating the real life sister of the real life brothers the images have little to do with what story line there is which isn't much many are stunning brooding pans across stark semi arid mountains and rivers think terrence malick or gus van sant there's not a little of both gerry and last days here interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames these are best enjoyed within the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music some quite good some rather odd but all gratuitous the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences with their occasional comment less inclusion of power stations and br br the relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic a major character is a man biting catfish never shown the more the nationalist commitments of the director are suggested the more the film's richer unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes though the director said at the screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third person narrative i'd like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog the result might be more moving and would in any case not be that much less baffling br br meantime this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object the bathing suit he had been wearing dangling from his penis this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is sorry pricked by something that's actually happening on screen what is that why's it hanging there but as usual no answers are provided very warholian very sixties and a not a little tiresome
<START> i was so excited to see the cast in this movie that i was completely surprised at how completely wrong this movie was i love john voight but i have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty the biblical accuracy was completely non existent and i honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children my kids stood astonished because even they know that lot was not even thought of when noah was building the ark i think that nbc should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is please do not buy this movie i have considered burning my copy but i have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they should have read before making this movie
<START> this movie has been advertised for over three months in greece as the biggest greek production ever well it could be but when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new something different what you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence george looks like he didn't really enjoy making this movie his acting is so simplistic that looks almost amateur the sound especially when some of the turkish actors speak english dubbed is full of hiss the thankfully few special effects showing istanbul and athens in the late 50's and early 70's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics finally we see the same boy from 1959 age 5 up to 1968 age 14 but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later br br so much for the biggest greek production at least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production and all one gets is a love story between 7 year olds who meet again 40 years later oh there is a political side too a couple of ironic remarks about the greek junta of '67 so childish that seem almost forced br br there are of course a couple of good things in the movie most of the actors are great mainly the very good scenery and the magnificent music by but they are so few for such an expensive production br br bottom line is it so bad a movie to tell the truth i don't know i just know that in no point does it justify its huge for greek standards budget
<START> viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles i give the nod to garbo but not by much in regard to her naturalness robeson is majestic but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground these were very progressive films for their time it's quite probable that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america
<START> this world war ii film set in borneo tries so hard to work on so many levels it is a shame it fails on all of them br br nick nolte is an escaping american who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the japanese he wanders deep into the jungles of borneo lost cue nigel who finds nolte's adopted tribe nolte now looking like robert plant has become his tribe's new king he defeated a staunch warrior in a bloody battle and had a telling tattoo on his chest a dragon now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one way ticket to borneo things are not going well in wants the tribe's help in fighting the japanese who are invading the island he teaches the natives how to use machine guns and a whole lot o shooting begins as the tribe becomes more successful they run up against a new squadron of japanese who are not like the others this squad the villages they conquer in order to keep their strength up talk about your sushi and they move through the jungles even quicker than the tribe since we know the outcome of the war we know eventually the tribe triumphs but with heavy casualties here come the spoilers is injured and returned to civilization he gives the location of the kingdom and nolte is captured then goes through the trouble of releasing nolte and the end credits roll br br direction is certainly adequate but the screenplay here is rather vague in its motivations it presents story ideas then abandons them in order to get to the next story idea nolte is awful as the soldier turned king desperately trying to channel the spirit of marlon brando's colonel kurtz he talks about freedom and the beauty of the jungle and the richness of his people and you will not believe for one second the words he utters he is often unintentionally funny especially his initial bug out in the jungle and he spends the rest of the film sounding like a hippie nigel spends the movie looking at nolte like he was raquel welch the vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship not quite to sex and settles into an unspoken relationship that must have had the natives talking br br often stands around and has an internal conflict repulsed at the tribe's but basking in nolte's attention his fellow straight laced british servicemen go native faster than the bounty landing party in tahiti but all i saw concerning borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green br br the climactic betrayal where gives away nolte's location is completely devoid of any reason there is not one thought given as to why does this except to keep the film going i was angry when by chance and nolte end up on the same ship going to the philippines the ship happens to run and runs to the hold to free the freshly shorn nolte no goodbye kiss but says farewell to the king explaining the title br br if you were fighting a war and an enemy squadron was eating your allies would that not freak you out this elite japanese squad is not shown enough although their eating habits are so horrific i would become a conscientious right away the same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in the 13th warrior br br other types of interesting ideas are dropped what about the fact that then modern technology brings about the deaths of so many backward people why did king nolte let the brits use his subjects without too much hesitation why can't hollywood find a decent actor to play general douglas macarthur br br in the end farewell to the king is a letdown not anchored by a strong lead and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options i cannot recommend this one br br this film is rated pg13 for strong physical violence strong gun violence some gore some profanity some sexual references and adult situations
<START> i must confess that i've been a huge fan of the almighty david the hoff hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80's tv series knight rider whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy revenge of the cheerleaders or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci fi gem the hoff has proved time and time again that he's a simply terrific and shamefully underrated actor supreme the hoff excels here as gary a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend leslie attractive brunette leslie cummings investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of they're doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotel's last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts a bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious lady in black an effectively eerie hildegard knef br br granted the rest of the cast gives the hoff a run for his money the ever perky linda blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed natch legendary jazz singer annie ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat poor annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and she's hung upside down in a chimney and gorgeous blonde catherine hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut fabrizio competent direction a suitably creepy atmosphere slick glossy cinematography the fluid prowling steadicam tracking shots are especially nice the gaudy special effects carlo maria and randy miller's spirited score and the gory sadistic violence are all up to par but ultimately it's the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky italian horror cheese such a winner he takes his shirt off once hubba hubba gets sprayed with blood and warning major spoiler ahead even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end produced by none other than joe d'amato this picture overall rates as good sleazy fun
<START> the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie then the story gets more and more outrageous the main character portrayed by marina is fantastic and had a difficult role this could have been a super great movie had the ending been more realistic
