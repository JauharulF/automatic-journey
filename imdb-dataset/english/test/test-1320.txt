<START> the main point of the movie imo is the fact the whole life has been nothing but a series of facades the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life br br when joanna accidentally hits cory she leaves the scene to call the police by the time she returns the police and ambulance are there as well as people from her community remarking what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there well respected in her community she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done but she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades br br great movie i have seen it many times
<START> this is one of those movies that are very underrated again i am voting for an underrated movie this movie has a good story line maybe a bit farfetched but it could happen sean astin one of my favorite actors again shows us a good performance the guy does a great job in acting but never gets recognized for his roles he has done well since the goonies not only him but louis jr does a swell job i thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters but who cares about money anyways all around this is a good movie that will have you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving itself i enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well
<START> after seeing this dvd i was floored it is so wonderful not only does it capture led zeppelin during performances they span a few years this only shows the growth of the band and the growth of their great music this dvd is a must have the dvd is over 5 hours long with extras the extras are also great pieces some are of the band performing in denmark and other various promo spots this contains footage that was once thought lost thankfully recovered and carefully restored to 5 1 dolby digital under direct supervision of jimmy page himself includes many timeless classics such as stairway to heaven going to california what is and what should never be moby dick and so many more great acoustic songs are also included this will correct any forethought that jimmy page isn't a supreme guitar legend
<START> the funniest movie from britain i have ever seen the is a tale of sex drugs cream and murder by the seaside dennis carter adrian average moron is out to impress his so called girlfriend andrea dawn french because she thinks he is too law abiding so to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him trouble is dennis' lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring and while telling her a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him and so begins this witty movie full of slick comedy and crude jokes dennis is banged up in the local nick and much to the arresting officers' delight there seems to be no way out andrea's earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of stand by your man by the two officers' then comes along commander robertson ronald allen chief intelligence scotland yard he makes a deal with dennis that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases dennis agrees and is teamed up with harvey duncan peter richardson and lesley reynolds jennifer saunders the rest is an unforgettable rib tickling experience with robbie coltrane as sergeant troy adding humourous colour to the film his walk along the dry dock against frankie goes to hollywood's two tribes is superb and probably the best scene in motion picture history the two officers' who nick dennis are wonderfully played by michael and patrick and alexei as the motorcycle cop is a laugh if you want something good to watch on a saturday night then i suggest you rent this you won't forget it
<START> a dark and painful look at the perils of drug addiction sinatra is wonderful in this film just watching his frenzied writhing and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying heroin maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the mindless drivel we are compelled to endure year after year br br it's the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new clean life for himself after being in prison trying to rid himself of his drug habit and his job of dealing cards in illegal gambling operations who is pulled down pulled back into the muck by the evils of human nature he is being taken advantage of by his employers the drug dealers and even his enigmatic crafty yet stupid wife br br even if you didn't like the film itself it's worth seeing just for the soundtrack it's all heavy swinging jazz with large drum and brass sections this with its groovy yet slightly sinister sound helps set the mood along with the grinning snaky drug and card dealers who always seem to hover like vultures around frankie machine br br i recommend this to anyone especially if you like film noir zoot suits fedoras or jazz
<START> sorry to say but was disappointed in the film it was very very rushed as i suppose you can understand a movie length version of pride prejudice would be and i felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story as the movie is so rushed unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all br br not only that this movie is boring i say that with a capital b 1 3 of the way through i started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over as i have read the book and watch the bbc version i knew how many scenes had to go before i could finally leave the cinema mr darcy whoever he is in this movie definitely can't act he looks also too young to play mr darcy every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something where is the build up at first he seems confused with everything he is just bizarre it all looks put on br br was trying not to compare to the colin firth version but if you love that version you will most likely be disappointed anyway br br the costumes are absolutely shocking where are the corsets i know elizabeth is poor but i think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion and hasn't been brought up in a her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of england br br i didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact that i don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things honestly mr who has wealth should know better there is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in and not at all like jane austen bingley's character is shockingly to me he behaves like a simpleton not a character to like and respect what about that laugh of his i hardly has a presence and mr mrs hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all keira did okay but it just ain't the same
<START> absolutely amazing humor up beat music and an anti war message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen br br first of all i love how clever this movie is particularly in the vietnam part of the plot it's interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous follow that with the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion which leaves me seething with anger at the war and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen wow br br also the music is really cool but what is very unique in this musical as opposed to evita or wizard of oz for example is that the lyrics don't tell the story the mood does along with the visuals and between songs dialog donna is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood whereas flesh failures has a driving intense beat in a minor key br br also i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering now i'm definitely not going to do drugs not that i ever intended to br br all things considered this is an amazing movie the only negative comment i could say is that it's sometimes hard to hear the dialog but who cares 10 10 stars
<START> rating 10 classic waters one of his best and most shocking films divine is the most filthy person ever mink stole also delivers a superb performance
<START> it's hard to imagine that the battle of gulch directed by the legendary d w griffith was made a way back in 1914 it is a showcase for griffith's emerging style br br the story centers around a group of settlers called the cameron brothers and their families which include a young waif mae marsh sent out from the east to live with her uncles and a young wife lillian gish who has just given birth a group of indians tries to capture the pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk during the confrontation the indian chief's son henry b is killed the indian chief plots his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of gulch br br it is this attack which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other time that forms the core of the picture the indians slaughter the towns folk women and children alike and drive them out of town towards the cameron's homestead the newborn baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the calvary br br the battle scenes contain some graphic violence for example we see a woman being scalped alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot down i have never seen an animal being slain so convincingly on screen mr griffith was becoming a master of staging large scale battle scenes a talent that he would use extensively in his epic civil war drama the birth of a nation released the following year br br even though it runs a scant 29 minutes the battle of gulch is nonetheless an exciting and historic bit of film making see if you can spot lionel barrymore and harry carey in bit parts
<START> creepy and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle people often assume that it was john carpenter that started the trend but as is the case with many of the genre's clichÃ©s the italians did it first movies like eyeball torso and blood and black lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery there were also a couple of american pre halloween slashers that warrant a mention classroom massacre keep my grave open and savage weekend clearly pre date 1978 whilst the town that dreaded sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen kill movies br br carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen over the years we've seen some memorable contenders but my favourites would have to be my bloody valentine's maniacal miner the sadistic soldier and wicked games' copper faced assassin i'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category the final scene in the house on sorority row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest costumes br br a leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion which of course doesn't exactly make for a scary disguise but in later years both blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit here's how the later of the two br br the screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation it seems that a stressed out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low brow turkeys so he's decided to hold his wife and kid at gunpoint detective shine david clover manages to wrestle with the gunman but unluckily for him he looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the end of the road for the grey haired officer fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from lisa ryder donna adams the california police department's hottest female law enforcer br br her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to detective first class and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts meanwhile a leather clad maniac is around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners ryder and shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called michael walker john mandell lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal police regulation doesn't seem to apply to her so before long she's dating the cameraman even though he's suspect numero uno when the bodies continue to pile up around the city she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the s m br br if anything effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its rein what started as a great stepping stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema by movies with flat direction zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors the boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their lack of strong dramatic line ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes unfortunately by this point in the cycle titles like rush week deadly dreams and the had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned characters ended up in an early grave br br donna adams doesn't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be couldn't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial i searched and searched but found nothing here of merit or note br br on the plus side if you manage to keep the tv turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity to be honest though i doubt that by that time you'll even care and another plus point well erm the disc is perfectly symmetrical which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy bad bad bad and not in a good way this is 90 minutes of my life that i could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest hair abysmal
<START> this film recreates historic flight across the atlantic while touching on episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks stewart was about 20 years too old to be playing the young flier but his fine performance particularly in the solo flight sequences makes this a minor quibble waxman's rousing score is a big plus despite the long running time wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the outcome is known what a year 1957 was for wilder besides this he also wrote and directed love in the afternoon and witness for the prosecution and his next two were some like it hot and the apartment what a run
<START> tonight's film course film was the legend of the fortress and during its 87 minute running time it managed to quickly jump into my top five most difficult films of all time that's difficult to watch films so different to everything else that you're seeing something totally alien a brief synopsis would be a group of georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders but every time they are about to put on the finishing touches for no readily apparent reasons it collapses so they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want to get the fortress to stay standing they need to find a youth a tall blonde blue eyed boy to be buried into one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that the construction job will be completed smoothly and sure enough in those closing moments there he is gladly being smeared in cement and eggs giggling as he's buried alive with only his mother to grieve br br it actually a fairly simple story but the director sergo working in soviet georgia in 1984 not too long after leaving a fifteen year jail term doesn't follow any of the film making rules we are used to there are very few close ups very often the action we need to be following is hidden in the bottom left hand corner of a landscape shot extra ordinarily easy to miss there are very few close ups and at times its hard to tell whose doing what to whom and why every now and then the film goes off on digressions which have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer the music is utterly mad with found sounds on screen instruments and church organ dropped in seemingly at random at times when nothing seems to be happening someone will break into a jig almost playing time until the next scene comes along but infuriatingly there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all so you're compelled to try and understand the message whatever it is one of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can't believe what you're seeing
<START> family guy is the best show on tv ever it has achieved great things that no other animated sitcom or any show has even come close to achieving br br in terms of animated sitcoms this era should be referred to as the era of animated sitcoms because there are so many of them and almost every one of them imaginable is being released on dvd there are some good ones i e south park futurama and the simpsons every animated sitcom has its own style technique of creating humor for instance futurama is funny because it always comments or acts on what just happened with a touch of humor the simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comedic technique and style that futurama does but the simpsons deserves the credit for it since it was on the air way before futurama and still remains on the air using the technique south park in my mind is the funniest show next to family guy because it uses a smart blend of vulgarity and silliness as it's technique of creating humor br br but enough about other animated shows let me tell you what makes family guy so funny family guy uses a comedic style that no other show has ever used before it uses a technique of having flashbacks occur after every joke this not only reinforces the joke but makes it seem funnier it also moves at a very quick pace these two criteria make it the funniest show on tv you have to see the show to believe it but once you see it you will most likely agree fyi the two funniest moments on family guy were 1 the 5 minute chicken fight in da boom and 2 the dick van dyke spoof in holy crap also in my mind family guy is a very modest show because while other shows create humor by getting familiar with their routines and characters most of family guy's jokes are based on the silliness of current events and pop culture this also shows that family guy is intelligent in addition to being modest because it reveals that the show has insight and this technique is extremely effective because they relate their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode they are found in br br family guy can be enjoyed by all ages because while younger children may not understand the pop culture references they will be amused by the hilarious silly antics of the characters especially peter the show is however a little bit more vulgar than the simpsons and futurama but it is less vulgar than south park so in terms of vulgarity family guy would rank somewhere in the middle when associated with the above shows but it would rank no 1 in terms humor and intelligence br br sadly it was cancelled last year not because it wasn't popular but because fox kept changing it's time slot so no one ever knew when it was on luckily we've got the dvd box sets which by the way are selling like crazy and reruns on cartoon network's adult swim available to us
<START> though not a complete waste of time really wasn't all sweet as it pretended to be nor are the ages of the actors they're portraying Â 18 my butt mckellen could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was 30 and ask us to believe it even michael j fox was more believable as a teen in 'back to the future' parts ii and iii okay maybe not they're probably equal believability if you can get past the obvious age flaw you'll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting paul anthony's so called anguish clarence lifetime moments and even though i do favor brendan fletcher it's best to just watch him and more in 'freddy vs jason ' incomprehensible scenes a faster than britney spears marriage incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate but still has one hand free Â i'm guessing this was the writer's fantasy an entire movie of despicable characters anthony might be playing someone that's 18 but acts like he's 12 and some odd john thrown in so anthony's character pip can save the day Â was there really a sex scene in front of a baby and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions scenes on the positive side i did enjoy ian mckellen's voice over seeing a rarely well portrayed straight gay friendship puppy love from someone who collects stuffed puppies that is good score some decent dialogue love the separation of gays and pedophilia Â wish more people would realize that and acting from the female leads as well as cumming i can't really recommend it as it's really trying to be too many things Â gay tolerance gay hustling homelessness wwii epic priesthood first love flawed judges etc etc etc Â on a shoestring budget
<START> spoiler ahead the mummy lon chaney jr is on the loose in a new england college town searching for a college student ramsey ames who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess ananka dull slow even at 65 minutes it moves slower than the mummy indifferently acted but the ending is worth waiting for the mummy gets the girl and she ages rapidly as the both slowly sink in a swamp this is i believe the only time in a universal monster movie that the monster got the girl that aside this is amateur night probably the worst of the mummy sequels and that's saying something
