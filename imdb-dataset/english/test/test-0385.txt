<START> i found the movie very real just as much as saving private ryan and gave an upfront account from the german perspective the graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie stalingrad was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle i recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history this was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it's realism again the weapons uniforms and hearing it german while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie in fact this being a german perspective of the battle i was rooting for the germans even though they were the and ultimate loser of the war
<START> anna christie 1930 br br anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even a brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual come on kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watches br br garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie she plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways it's a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this pre code sound era br br though based on a successful eugene o'neil play it's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems she's overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year
<START> society heiress susan fletcher hopkins and her wealthy father simon fletcher henry stephenson are vexed that their young nieces joan betty and katie are living a bohemian lifestyle in greenwich village with their artist uncle john milland after the death of their parents susan's sister and john's brother simon has given up trying to convince john to allow he and susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to greenwich village herself posing as an actress to try to gain information and or persuade him to see reason what she discovers however is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle john and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well but that she is quickly falling in love with john inevitably her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom br br i really enjoyed this film and found that its very short running time 70 minutes was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story miriam hopkins one of the great 1930's 1940's actresses is delightful in this film her energy style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends this is the earliest film i've seen ray milland in and he was actually young and non patrician looking and apparently three years younger than his co star his energy and carefree manner in wise girl were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual darker films honestly though i am usually not remotely a fan of child actors i really enjoyed the two young girls who played susan's nieces they were endearingly precocious and were really the jewels of the film unfortunately i can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent br br wise girl was a film that was made three years after the hollywood code was and to some extent this was abundantly clear by the quick happy ending and the pie in the sky and ease with which the characters lived the alleged bohemian co op was in fact a gorgeous cul de sac where the artists lived for free or for trade and everything is tied up very nicely throughout fortunately this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and short comings and i was able to just take wise girl for what it was a good old fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing unfortunately films of the romantic comedy drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining or i wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics 7 10
<START> i actually saw this movie at a cinema at the time i was working shifts and went there during a matinÃ©e on a hot summer day when i couldn't sleep the cinema was air conditioned br br it was an early multi screen complex and i somehow got into the wrong venue i had intended to doze through something else but as things transpired there would be no sleeping shortly after the wrong movie began i was additionally disconcerted by a group of female cleaners who came in and used it as their social club i was the only other person there and it is a measure of the movie's appeal that they habitually expected the place to be empty and asked me if i minded their presence i didn't br br within about half an hour the conversation proved to be more interesting than the entertainment i had paid for br br this movie oozed out of the screen with the cheesiness of very stale the kind that has little dark hairy growing on the surface i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning the cleaners provided an anticipatory cue by putting their fingers in their ears br br it was about some city bird going to live in the sticks amongst a load a backwood folk putting them straight but at the same time being taught a moral lesson or two herself like you do a sort of of there was a sententious smugness about the whole production in particular the leading actress had an irritating habit of staring at every hick with a kind of intense beatific compassion as if she herself were the patron saint of thickies br br and i believe at some stage she wrote a book br br long before the end i had become fascinated by one of the cleaner's hushed and breathy tails of sexual impropriety br br one suspects that there are some to whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think constitutes a meditation the best that i can say is that i would not want to share their salad br br i have never seen this movie advertised as showing on television which surprises me it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs br br if you ever work shifts be sure to get into the right theatre or hope for some cleaning ladies
<START> inexplicably i watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about this movie held my attention from beginning to end and ran me through the whole range of emotions and might have helped me discover a few i never knew about br br dustin hoffman absolutely shines as ted kramer he is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life jilted husband workaholic ad executive and loving father meryl streep as joanna kramer was less central to the movie simply because joanna was absent for a good part of it but when she was on screen she gave hoffman a run for his money the true standout though in my opinion had to be young justin henry as billy kramer children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown and justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with dad only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his dad when it was his mom who walked out on him young justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role br br all in all this is an excellent oscar worthy movie whose only weak point was what i thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle ted and joanna had gone through but there's not much else to complain about here br br 9 10
<START> the synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives i like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of chocolat with a less fairy tale and more bite what i got was a cast of despicable characters br br for a character driven movie to be effective i need to feel a connection or compassion for the people there was no one with whom i could relate in the movie grazia golino whose work i admired in rain man portrays a mentally ill probably bipolar female that is often rude aggressive and violent her husband bickers and yells when he is not hitting or slapping someone the children are rude brats they yell at each other and the females in the movie they attack other children with no provocation violence begets violence this seems to be an island of unfeeling aggressive violent and rude people all the way around br br the direction is not compelling there are intermixed scenes that attempt to be art but instead bore the viewer the location is exceptionally gorgeous but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film br br i would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie
<START> this is the best direct to dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme's best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed 2 adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border
<START> in this episode a man and his dog go after eating dinner with his wife of 50 years he's devoted to his wife and his dog br br while hunting his dog jumps in the river after the dog and he follows the man dies and doesn't know it he tries to talk to his wife and his grave diggers to no avail br br what follows is a tug of war between heaven and hell for the man's soul and his dog helps make the decision he's being tricked by the devil and won't go in to heaven unless his dog comes with him br br it makes you wonder if all the animal lovers have the right idea and want to go to heaven with them
<START> it may be a remake of the 1937 film by capra but it is wrong to consider it only in that way it was supposed to expose hilton's novel in a completely different way as a musical is excellent the scenery is terrific the characters good and anyone like leonard maltin who considers the bacharach music awful must be completely deaf i strongly recommend it
<START> this movie is sad according to my fellow imdb users spoiler raptor uses stock footage from the carnotaur films well since i have not seen the carnotaur movies i cannot say but i do notice some pretty bad editing and even worse acting this movie is one big steaming pile of s it makes absolutely no sense here is this thing that calls itself a plot mad scientist re creates raptors raptors kill people sheriff investigates spoiler although i don't know what it is that i'm spoiling sheriff catches on to mad doctor's plans army guys are sent in and raptors start killing army guys raptors yeah right i could make a clay figure that looks more real the fx are the cheapest ever used in a movie there is a lot of gore cheap gore it doesn't even look real i will agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it ends there are about two seconds of originality in this film and that only comes from when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something this idea has been used in about 100 000 other movies with 100 000 different names overall i'm gonna give raptor 1 5 just because it ended
<START> first off i have to say acting isn't very good miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly spencer her brother is a way much better actor spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but sorry it just isn't good sam doesn't even get credit i mean come on pretty self centered eh freddy isn't bad i don't have a comment i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast they go shouting out all their lines it's sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe br br the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining at least this show isn't boring it has nice plots pretty strong many kids will like this because they don't look for flaws br br overall this is a bad show but it's not boring
<START> i know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics but i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it the real star here is the fantastic dylan moran he never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises he also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls special mention must also go to michael who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city dublin accent the only weak link is caine who while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character it probably won't play that well overseas but it's well worth a watch all the same
<START> horrendous comedy in which a beautiful crazy woman liv tyler comedically destroys the lives of three men matt dillon paul reiser and john goodman dillon hires a hit man michael douglas to kill her what is happening to comedy the year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever saving silverman sugar and spice freddy got fingered etc etc this is one of the worst there's not one repeat not one funny moment in it the jokes are either stupid unfunny smutty or real sick also there's a strong hatred of women in this garbage the only main female character tyler is constantly used as a sex object also extreme bloody violence is thrown in at the end the only bearable moments come from reba mcentire as a psychiatrist and andrew dice clay in two roles both psychos dillon goodman and reiser have hit an all time career low with this the only way to go is up and poor tyler she quit doing intelligent gutsy independent films for this and douglas what was he on when he agreed to this an utter piece of crap to be avoided at all costs
<START> this movie is simply one of the best movies i have the of owning it took me years to come up with this movie and it was well worth it the movie is meant to be anti drug propaganda but turns itself into the opposite while not even halfway through the movie the relished look on the faces of the players as they receive their bounty of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe untill the final phase pf their drug induced lives heroin comes for its say yikes this is the anti drug message that was so fabulously sought the soundtrack for this movie kicks butt by far it is one of pink best albums ever if ever the chance take a look listen and moment to witness a spectacularly made movie
<START> maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller' i don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice hell i would have done it for free this magical aircraft managed to morph from a to a to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of where everyone spoke different languages i actually rewound the tivo and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first it was
