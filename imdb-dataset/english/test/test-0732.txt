<START> this is a very strange product from hollywood apparently it didn't test well because actors who have footage in the credits have been edited completely out of the movie which means a hasty cut job was done on it it feels like it was wrestled out of the usually competent demme's hands and just thrown away on the other and it is so totally lacking in substance that maybe nothing could save it it has no real center either narratively or time wise although it says the running time is 92 minutes i seem to recall it ending abruptly around the 80 minute mark it's over before it even gets going it's pretty much laugh free br br the merits of the matthew modine picture were as elusive then as the luke wilson picture is now
<START> ronald colman plays a prodigal son while he is not a bad guy he is a bit flighty and hasn't done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a jolly good time now that his latest venture in africa has failed he's on his way home to england his rich upper class father plans on tossing him out on his ear though thanks to winning style he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms br br at this point there are two women in his life showgirl myrna loy and rich girl loretta young who is already engaged how will all this work out and will ronald wise up and act like a responsible adult these are the main themes of this pleasant little film br br this isn't a great movie and certainly won't change your life but it certainly is very entertaining and fun most of this is due to the always genial acting of ronald colman heck in the heyday of his career in the 1930s he could have played in reefer madness or some other dreck and still made it entertaining and likable due to his charming persona his seemingly effortless style in this movie make it very easy to like him and it's easy to see why both loretta young and myrna loy are in love with him in the film plus the writing is very witty and make this a nice romantic comedy
<START> i have to admit i'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies and in fact i seem to like them less and less every time i see a new one and that isn't really surprising when i end up watching films like brotherhood of satan despite its low rating on imdb i was surprised to hear some good things about this film and my expectations went up this turned out to be a big mistake as this is exactly the film that its rating suggests it is namely a very bad one the plot is your basic bunch of satanists causing trouble and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and it's not really clear why naturally satanists are behind it and this is bad news for a mother father and daughter on a road trip who become trapped in the mysterious town i had a feeling that this film might be along the same lines as the crappy satanist flick 'the devil's rain' and while it's not quite as silly as robert later film it's not much better either the plot seems to be fairly down to earth but it's also rather boring and i can't say that i enjoyed myself at all during this movie brotherhood of satan obviously has its fans but i'm not one of them this is a film that i see no reason to recommend
<START> hello all you lovely dirty dancing fans i came across this message board when i was bored one day and think it's cool i absolutely love dd i first saw it at my friends house when i was 13 now i'm 17 and got hooked i saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after i bought the dvd for myself at this stage i have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it carried a watermelon '' it's gotten so bad that i bought the soundtrack and recorded micky and song and now it's the on my phone most of my friends think it's a crap movie but i don't care what they think of it i know it's brill i was reading the comments earlier and i have a few questions for you lot 1 why are you asking trivial questions like what ages lisa and baby are i don't think it matters that much they are teenagers in the 60's isn't that enough 2 where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about it sounds very interesting please reply to this i'd like to see other fans opinions cheers xxx
<START> the devil in the dark is william shatner's favorite episode it is also one of my favorite episodes the program is pure star trek because it deals with one of the series' main themes the respect for other life forms i do not think one could get a clearer example of one of the show's most interesting ideas in this episode kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet the story is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment today's concerns with environmental causes make the show more relevant now than ever before it is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast one memorable sequence involves spock joining with the mind of the monster plenty of tension between spock and kirk they want to solve the problem using different methods adds to the fun shatner and leonard nimoy do some of their best work here
<START> kevin spacey again picks a winner with k pax an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the character's naive yet at the same time unquestionably wise point of view br br it's enjoyable trying to work out 'if he is or he as the plot expands and the robert porter character gets fleshed out however some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldn't have been any other way br br my few issues with the film revolve around the rather cartoony and over simplified portrayal of mental patients i was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and i don't feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behave br br that said i realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is shot and the story unwraps at a pleasing rate br br bridges is great and spacey delivers a languid and relaxed performance more like a stand up than an alien br br a good film that will get you talking with your friends
<START> chances are i'm gonna spoil valuable plot points while writing this and because i can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things then i suggest you hop right on to the next review you know i don't mind the cult films being filed under the cult section and people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the reality i mean is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo christian propaganda films be filed with the other special interest movies br br i couldn't have been more flabbergasted had pat robertson made a porn movie or would that be br br it was bad enough that there was an insufficient count of kicking and punching in this it was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways it was bad enough that it wasn't filed under special interest with other cult films it was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being realistic as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the and the really profound and nasty evil isn't done by human beings usually in the name of religions based on the god of abraham it was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful br br no the really bad part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off and declared i for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now just to get that out of my head preferably both if you have it and we had just met her
<START> i would say 'bride of is a return to greatness but the series was never really great very good 1 was 2 3 were throwaways and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie and it contains the best subtitle tagline chucky gets lucky so he does in the role of jennifer tilly who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for 'star trek voyager ' tilly didn't just create a presence she added much needed humor back story drama tension and a great little sidekick play thing for chucky and as much as i liked her in the feature she can't get all the credit the props watch the first 1 2 minutes for horror homages the writing the inside jokes again the opening pinhead and chucky lines were great in fact if this were a movie it would take 3 4 sequels just to do it justice among others mercifully chucky and the series has given up on andy the hide the soul quest and just settled for a new way out of his body he teams up with his ex tilly whom he transfers into a bride doll and a couple of bonnie clyde teens really heigl to regain this pendant buried with chucky's human corpse this is for any chucky fan 1980s slasher horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous films it's funny dark harmless gory Â but not over the top and despite tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time it's always great to see her after all you barely see her play poker anymore side note of course i picked up on the superman reference Â hackensack nj
<START> although the premise of the movie involves a major coincidence the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine empathizing with both and wanting them to reconcile sam waterston and ted danson are fine in their roles as well doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship while the story tends to leap through time occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail it still flows and avoids any real confusion this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good chick flick
<START> the murders in opera are not actual murders as much as they are symbols of past events and parts of betty's own fractured personality in fact betty is the same person a male that suzy is in suspiria only a decade later in life suzy was a boy of ten who befriended another boy of ten with a more mild version of his own background br br it helps to think of betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay she spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo it seems and other parts of her apartment seem foreign to her somehow as though other people live in those other rooms br br dario argento's movies sync with a wide array of rock music as well as funk dario starts the right at the beginning of his films the flash of the eye in opera and the start of a drum roll in suspiria there are also standard movies that opera and suspiria sync with for example opera with with a record album by judas priest called priest live as does suspiria and suspiria very well with a kiss record album entitled kiss alive ii movies like rosemary's baby the exorcist the image and the vampire happening are sync movies argento uses which deal with the same subject matter as argento's films these along with many others reveal betty to be a male who suffered sexual torture at the hands of his father since birth even in the womb according to a certain anne rice novel entitled br br anyway large budget films are occult works which relay spy information collected by occult means all in synchronized symbolic alchemical fashion usually the sync point in a film is the beginning of the sound score or it is the first image of the film beyond any film company lead in sometimes it is more creative the heavy metal music used in opera and phenomena are simply music that were deciphered out of other films that argento's movies sync with an intellectual game of sorts among the elite within the industry br br so betty doesn't respond normally to the murders she witnesses because she didn't ever witness a murder of any real person she herself simply suffers soul murder she witnesses her own murder this individual's father almost dropped him down an abandoned mine shaft in at age 4 in 1970 he was on the verge of falling off a wood plank his father balance him on before dad changed his mind and grabbed him and yanked him back off it the kid felt nothing consciously memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual via extreme sexual repression and the vague memories which remain are of the big square deep hole in the desert and no significance is placed on this memory because of the lack of conscious trauma the loss of trauma also a buried trait is portrayed in the 1975 film entitled the image those sausages up in the attic in suspiria are each individual memories of the first three or so years of a life toys in the attic br br the reason betty or suzy is a female character is because the individual christina character mirrors is a male who has been trained into a female role of sorts since birth all of the dvd's of the simpsons cartoon sync with suspiria with his very nature having been molded along queen lines the x files episodes sync with opera this has even altered his body to be beautiful in the way a woman's is behavior alters genetics a more recent movie entitled death proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual br br virtually the entire life of this person is mirrored on large budget films record albums and books made since 1966 and father prior to 1966 and after the scorpions album entitled virgin killer is a suspiria sync album the original album cover acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through the skylight
<START> ben rupert is a deeply unhappy adolescent the son of his unhappily married parents his father nicholas farrell is a vicar and his mother laura linney is well let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in jesus' army it's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul mouthed eccentric once famous and now forgotten actress walton julie walters that he finally finds himself in true and fashion of course is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness br br of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and walters who could sleep walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent it's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink that she's at her best the problem is she's the only interesting character in the film and it's not because of the script which doesn't do anybody any favours on the other hand isn't just unhappy he's a bit of a bore as well while linney's starched bitch is completely one dimensional still she's got the english accent off pat the best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable with the emphasis on the mildly
<START> this movie scared the hell out of me for no good reason the eerie music was well written but other than that its a complete waste of time and it really disturbed me i'm not really sure why either if you just want to see a bad 'b' horror movie i guess you could give it a shot but only as a last resort
<START> the romanian cinema is little known out of romania no directors from romania came out to the attention of the international public as some from other countries from eastern europe like hungary or yugoslavia succeeded to do one of the few great directors in romanian cinema is lucian pintilie who 35 ago directed a great movie quickly taken out of the circuit by the communist censorship after that film still a reference for the romanian cinema pintilie was not allowed to create freely in romania until the communist rule fell in 1989 br br reminds me film 35 years ago the title means 'the rage' and i cannot imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently it is about a lost generation while in the classic of pintilie the root of evil is in the oppression and lies of the communist regime here the young folks need to deal with the emergence of the sub culture and the moral filth that filled in the void left by the totalitarian rule the end is tragic and painfully expected br br the movie is well directed and the acting is good without too much complexity it succeeds to create an emotional link between the characters and the viewer one would say that some situations seem similar to '8 miles' or 'the fast and the furious' but look at the date of the production this film was made at the same time if not before the western peers if this is indeed the first film of director dan as imdb says it is an outstanding debut in any case a good movie can compete and may sell well on the western market br br there is hope for a new generation of romanian films that with some luck and good distribution will make its place in the international cinema scene br br 8 10 on my personal scale
<START> if you are a fan of early duke movies this lone star oldie is a good one what more could you ask for than duke yak and gabby lots of good and shootin' i found it amazing that duke's singing voice was bill bradbury who is none other than bob steele's twin brother it has been reported that bob steele was a high school classmate and friend of duke so twin brother bill may have been too anyway if you like good clean early western movies don't miss this one we don't have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes just sit back relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time it's called entertainment folks
<START> this absurd movie was about a goodie two shoe teen girl that really wanted to be valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name mrs tingle katie holmes who plays this goodie two shoe is faced with the biggest dilemma of her teenage life when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail mrs test mrs tingle comes along catches holmes the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here exam mrs tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of holmes passing her class and the classmate guy who apparently has his eye on holmes always wondered why she never gave him the time of day he's an idiot feeling desperate holmes and her friends visit mrs tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that holmes was planning to cheat it all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and arrow at mrs tingle threatening her to make things right for holmes mrs tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as holmes and her friend's captive br br during mrs tingle captivity under holmes they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious coach in bed with mrs tingle i found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in mrs house eating up her food and going though her private work at one point holmes found mrs grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor the grade of her challenge for valedictorian the end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film resolving on pure irony slapstick and absurdity br br this has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character holmes would ever play in her entire life i wanted to help mrs tingle get free to really dig a grave for holmes she was manipulative selfish and conniving she even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him and she didn't like him from attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing mrs grade book to taking her best friend's man you would think that holmes would get what she deserves in the end right unfortunately she obtains everything her heart desires showing that being wicked manipulative selfish and whining can get you what you want br br mrs tingle was suppose to be the character you didn't like they didn't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be taught this lesson she was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation personally i felt that her opinions about young people were validated with holmes and her friend's actions every time i kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail holmes they kept her tied up in bed ate up her food like a bunch of pigs drank up the woman's wine messed with her personal belongings and we're suppose to believe that she didn't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads and the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film forget idiot we need a new word for him that isn't in the webster's dictionary he brought the major trouble into life then made things worse when he came into mrs house uninvited behind holmes and corners mrs tingle with a bow and arrow i was thrilled every time mrs tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him or choke the wannabe actress best friend br br if you're a teen out there and want to see when a teen's manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world see this unfunny caricature filled unintentional film noir
