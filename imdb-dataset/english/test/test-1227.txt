<START> boring cliched and predictable the only original bit was the brighton location for gangsters it is certainly no lock stock etc hannah was likeable in sliding doors in circus i developed no empathy with his character and couldn't give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise i was so uninterested i didn't even care why the movie was given the name circus booooring don't visit this big top
<START> aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours br br it starts with an interminably long intro where the family is introduced including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister completely clichÃ©d pa and ma and incredibly annoying grandpa played by charles chic sales while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street the mobsters flee through the family's house leaving them as witnesses to the crime br br the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob it all winds up in a predictable manner br br good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating nat pendleton as one of the mobsters and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the daughter br br if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman try 1932's beast of the city avoid this one if at all possible
<START> rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine but her impending success as a solo with romantic offers all around has smitten boss gene kelly chomping at the bit terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy with unmemorable musical sketches the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s with hayworth portraying her own grandmother kelly as always dances well but acts with false sincerity when he's serious he's insufferable and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline the script is a lead weight not even giving supporting players phil silvers and eve arden any good lines 1 2 from
<START> a day in the life of a dimwitted cab driver sometime around christmas the cab driver picks up a fare they have a interlude he drops off the fare he picks up another fare another interlude and so it goes on like this for 90 friggin' minutes none of it convincing or interesting for even one minute skip it
<START> the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months the plot of the story was uninteresting the movie ended when he became khan i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that the jokes where really poor the narrator himself could have told a bit more about mongolian history traditions etc my co viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end
<START> saw this film the first time in 1953 with my older brother it was one of the great 3 films released in that era we saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it scott does a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the indian arrows rather than surround sound oh for those polaroid lenses again
<START> the film begins in latvia just after wwi being a history teacher i knew that multinational troops occupied much of russia during this time there was serious concern about the spread of bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests however some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army as the nations involved really wanted to see the so called whites win however the whites were deeply some wanting the return of a czar some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies the whole expedition was doomed and left the ussr after only a year or two however what i did not know was that german troops were also involved this surprised me as they had just lost wwi and weren't in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition br br this is the backdrop for the film but it's also about a pro communist rich lady and her ill fated love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her so she then these desires by various affairs while none of this sex is all that graphic this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldn't show to younger audiences br br while the setting for this film is interesting the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen i don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression as it will no doubt make it worse the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seen such as mostly martha das boot mother goes to heaven wings of desire or ali fear eats the soul among others
<START> well i must admit when i saw the trailer for this movie i was looking forward to it i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer thats the impression i got of this movie however i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin although there were a couple of amusing scenes in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing br br i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of opera making the movie feel dragged out and slow br br all in all although there are some touching scenes the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy br br not fantastic and as i have said before bland
<START> as i write this no user reviews are in yet but there are 17 votes with a 4 8 average so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments i didn't notice any and even if i had i don't think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them br br a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science police tactics and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment i tend to fall into the yes that's a reasonable reaction camp especially when the mistakes are central to the plot with this movie i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy police tactics weapons science folklore common sense and human behavior outside of b movies that is in short i can't think of any non trivial thing they got right br br any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit impervious to all small arms able to disappear into another dimension at will and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion they don't make ghosts like they used to combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie
<START> being a d b sweeney fan i've been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time i recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable it had some really hilarious scenes the dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling but i think the movie also showed that it's possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it's been derailed
<START> there are many distinct problems with the movie killshot for one there are way too many coincidences the husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up with someone the killer knows okay i will take that one the kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it okay i will take that one as well before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer who doesn't kill him but decided to go with him on the job it's starting to get real weak then they show up on the same day that the husband has an interview with his wives boss no one is there but the wife and the husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office they make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right guy that is just in the first 15 minuets br br there are a lot more holes in this movie then i care to talk about why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agency i don't know why he didn't shoot the woman on her porch i don't know why he kept letting that dumb kid make all those stupid moves and mess a whole lot of crap up i don't know why the girlfriend was even in the movie i don't know why he decided not to pocket the gun and just leave it out on the counter i don't know why they even went into the witness protection program i don't know what i do know is that the casting director did a great job the director of photography did very good work the location scout picked great locations and the production designer was worth every penny so my advice for anyone that is going to pick a script that is going to be so well worked by the crew make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not foiled by a peak through an open window
<START> lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch garfield's gritty breakthrough performance introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the brandos and and so on after the war but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating priscilla lane is a bright engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register though they're all allowed to be tart and witty and i just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides garfield jeffrey lynn is a pleasant enough actor but he lacks the movie star weight to match up with garfield's hard luck mickey borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack imagine a jimmy stewart or someone in the part also i was not convinced that garfield would make the pivotal to say the least final decision that he made the film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action it feels awfully rushed and under motivated br br still it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly it falls short of being a classic but it does contain a few classic moments the two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic
<START> very mild spoilers a basic plot outline no real details br br if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in maryland and the only reason i agreed to go was because it was free i expected a few chuckles but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d not much more then that br br the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at jack black's humble christian origins in a midwest american town the film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass the second half of tenacious d we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled pick of destiny again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face that said there were times it felt a bit long it's only 100 minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss and when they miss they miss bad same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so then kept going anyway br br i will say that the r rating really saved this movie from bombing the d's humor simply couldn't work without cussing sex and drug references but unless you're a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle a bit but is it worth 9 bucks i don't think so i was tempted to rate it a 6 but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres a 7 seems more appropriate just be sure it's your style
<START> i lay the blame for the comebacks on anyone who enjoyed date movie and epic movie you people encouraged the fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all the comebacks barely qualifies as a parody heck it barely qualifies as a movie this is a comedy in theory but not in execution no one not even the people involved with this mess could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie director tom brady the hot chick has made something truly wretched here br br the plot if you can even call it that centers on a man named fields david koechner right when i heard his name within the first couple seconds of the film i knew i was in for a long movie funny names are seldom funny and become even less funny the more you hear them is one of the worst coaches in the world but he's been given another chance by his best friend freddie wiseman carl to coach a ragtag high school football team called the comebacks must not only lead the team to victory but also teach them the ways of inspirational sports movie clichÃ©s he expects his kids to have poor grades and problems with alcohol and ridicules them when they don't when it looks like the team has a chance to play at the big championship toilet bowl game did 10 year olds write this script is shocked to discover that freddie is the coach of the big rival team that his team will be playing against turns out freddie only encouraged to take the coaching job because he wanted the comebacks to lose br br the comebacks is a movie so forced and pathetic i almost had a hard time believing what i was watching spoof movies have recently turned into a game of spot the movie reference and this continues the tradition it tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports movies as it can but it either does absolutely nothing with them expecting us to just point at the screen and laugh out of familiarity or it attempts to be funny and falls flat on its face some of the films referenced include field of dreams bend it like beckham rocky balboa friday night lights stick it radio miracle remember the titans gridiron gang invincible and dodgeball a true underdog story but wait wasn't dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies so in other words we're watching a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies if that makes any sense to you you're just the audience this movie is looking for some of these films are referenced in the plot and some like the rocky one are just thrown in for no reason because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many films as possible there are some that the movie even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue just in case we've missed the obvious reference you know a movie is in trouble when it has to spell out its own jokes to us br br the worst thing is that the screenplay by tv veterans and first time screen writers ed yeager and joey doesn't even know the first and most important rule of parody you have to play it straight the actors have to pretend they're not in on the joke the reason why the classic zucker brothers movies like airplane top secret and the naked gun are remembered so fondly is because they cast serious actors like leslie nielsen yes he was a serious actor before he turned to comedy and robert stack and then threw them into ridiculous situations what made it funny is that they acted like they weren't in a comedy and kept a stone face to the weirdness around them those films wouldn't have worked if they played their roles broadly the comebacks proves this as all the actors are forced to play their roles so goofy it's like they're screaming at us to laugh david koechner keeps on flailing his arms bulging his eyes and screaming at the top of his lungs to the point he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a dead end comedy and just tries too hard to pretend he's having a good time the movie also doesn't understand the art of celebrity cameos also an important factor when it comes to parody films what kind of cameos do we get in the comebacks andy dick and dennis rodman br br by the time the movie throws in an out of nowhere and extremely pointless cast musical number to journey's don't stop believing for absolutely no reason whatsoever i was just about ready to walk out the theater door i was the only person at my screening and the thought of this movie going on its pathetic way to a completely empty house kind of appealed to me i did sit through the rest of the comebacks and i was not rewarded for my efforts the sad thing is fox is not yet done killing the spoof genre they have a parody of 300 coming out next year called meet the spartans i'd say it can't be much worse than this but i've seen the trailer and i wouldn't want to get your hopes up
<START> robert brutal quasi black comedy the grissom gang a reworking of the 1948 british film no orchids for miss has 1920s heiress kim darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves soon that gang is dispatched and poor kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch third rate gangster brothers with sweaty pasty faces and a mother who looks like buddy ebsen in drag at first darby not very plucky and not very smart attempts to escape this drooling brood but they're onto her eventually she just gives up trying and therein lies the trouble with the story are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her is her growing concern for the family half wit supposed to be heartwarming these are disgusting cretinous characters and i wanted to see as little of them as possible but since the side stories the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving floozy singer connie stevens are rather dull the director has no choice but to keep foisting those sweaty faces on us pretty soon nervous darby starts sweating too although her scene up in the is sensitively performed and climactic moments are thought provoking if disorganized from
