<START> i know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless i was at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killers the plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and as you know saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot thank god for that seriously though bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with it's originality having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone i know what i'd choose br br also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it's extremely entertaining many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore this film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry there's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again cough halloween cough but that's not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows there wasn't any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it
<START> uwe boll slips back in his film making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life i'm guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had it really stinks clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i've ever seen this isn't that bad but it is close simply because it should have been better then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film i'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable
<START> i laughed my ass off for an hour i had no idea who dan was why haven't i heard of dan finnerty before he's hysterical and so are his backup singers they make all of these women songs that we would never wanna hear a new experience they blow these songs away this was on bravo last night why isn't this dan guy like ultra famous great voice charisma to burn he blew me away with this show i just read on the internet that he was once a member of stomp i guess there isn't anything he can't do i saw stomp at a ucla theater years ago and those guys were amazing this show last night was done by dreamworks does that mean that spielberg did this why don't they star this dan finnerty in a movie there was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera's cut to the audience everyone was so into it singing along or dancing the whole show had this amazing energy my only complaint was that it was not longer but looking back when you see how much energy these guys put out i guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such gusto for over an hour man i loved this show
<START> this is a great movie the best role peter strauss ever did the music is good the message harsh the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw only in the seventies did they make them like this one
<START> yeah i know my title sucks i couldn't think of any other title x ice is a brilliant first season episode very interesting idea and good acting as well the whole worm looking thing was really creepy in my opinion i've never been a fan of insects so all the insect episodes are creepy to me x anyway lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode br br the good the parasite thing awesome br br scully finally trusting mulder awww 33 br br it was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear though if someone told me they had to put that thing in my ear i think the whole cabin would be dead br br the bad how did the dog stay alive for so long br br how didn't huffman get those black spots or maybe she did but no one saw it br br conclusion very good episode especially for season 1 8 10
<START> rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a jollies project for robert redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine br br the story is as light as powdered snow with redford's small town boy david what kind of lead name is that who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and team mates women are a mere side show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a free thinking independent woman played by camilla the ski ing sequences are fine with some good stunt work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day plus i'm not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel i couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another br br of the actors redford best profile forward doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material ms does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way br br in truth though there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a fig for any of the leading characters one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldn't it had the potential to be a really cool hip remake of a cool show but that's where it fell apart it was too hip too cool first of all all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers which i'd seen lots of times and the editing was very disjointed so that the scenes didn't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place claire danes who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles the only bright spot was giovanni ribisi as pete his slightly stupid yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing overall though i'd recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more
<START> this is the first woody allen film i've found not worth watching i think woody has tried many different genres to interest results but this movie just left me irritated and bored the music is lovely but don't bother watching this hopeless mock
<START> after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend people judge to harshly on what the expected to see i figure if you go into a movie open minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre created standards you want it to reach br br since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and open mind and was very much pleased since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll lovely animation deep story and the always joyful ninja hack n slashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever made br br i am not promising that you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise br br before speaking be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence chinese proverb
<START> almost no information is available about this movie or its air dates after an ongoing and exhaustive search i found the dvd to be available for 3 99 release date february 28 2006 try yahoo dvd and video in order to get this information posted i will continue to state that this is a well made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church it is a chance to see william l peterson before c s i turned him into a star equally featured in the story is the venerable barbara hershey does anyone remember when she was barbara hershey seagull i have to keep writing to get this posted thank you to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure tv film which obviously leaves a lasting impression on many
<START> were it not for the fact that this came as a 2 dvd set paired with the original american graffiti were it not for the fact that i've been here in iraq for several months and at this point will watch pretty much anything i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes this movie was appallingly bad on so many levels i just don't know where to start poorly acted shot directed written scored edited my 9 year old daughter's first forays into film making are superior to this and she was filming the dog sleeping come to think of it i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars but i'm biased if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality film making then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in english i'll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is
<START> harvey keitel gives a typically top rate performance in one of his first ever lead roles as brash ambitious uncompromising young staff producer coleman buckmaster a real talented hot shot with a discerning golden ear and the son of a famous jazz pianist to boot coleman's eager to cut some tracks with the smokin' r b outfit the group none other than earth wind fire in their awesomely funky prime but his commercial label a chord records run by uptight mob connected middle of the road square jerry a properly ed nelson wants him to record a hit single for the hideously insipid carpenters like pop pap trio the pages an allegedly squeaky clean bunch which includes smarmy pedophile step dad franklin a perfectly vile bert parks bitchy neurotic daughter a fine flighty turn by perky comely brunette cynthia bostwick and hedonistic smack addict son gary former 50's juvenile sitcom staple jimmy boyd the extremely naive and idealistic coleman must learn pronto how the music business truly works and play the lowdown dirty game as best he can or else he'll lose both the group and his credibility br br adopting an acrid incisive harsh and biased script from syndicated columnist and rock journalist robert director sig shore who's most famous for producing superfly shows a decidedly cynical and unflattering depiction of the various bribes pay offs broken promises back stabbings and double dealings which are an unpleasant yet intrinsic part of the largely corrupt rock music business with particularly thoughtful thematic asides concerning art vs commerce fighting to retain one's artistic integrity and the then recent push to rock into bland useless creatively stagnant mainstream respectability moreover this gritty downbeat gem offers a rare fascinating minutely detailed and wholly believable backstage glimpse at the recording process as recording booth console cowboy coleman struggles gamely in his own words to make chicken salad out of chicken s t appearing in nifty bits are disc jockey and legendary fifth beatle murray the k as leering lecherous dj big john little bites his hand after big john paws her thigh during a live on air interview new york soul dj and host of nbc's friday night videos frankie crocker as his own self r b singer songwriter doris troy she penned the lovely just one look as a church pianist and tubby bald 70's blaxploitation favorite charles macgregor as a priest at a wedding the rather poor sound and allan metzger's sloppy cinematography inadvertently add to the film's overall ragged rough around the edges documentary style authenticity although technically a bit lacking this movie overall still rates as one of the great most bitterly pessimistic unsung behind the scenes gems from the 70's
<START> this is not a film is a clever witty and often heart touching movie it's a retrospective of a failed relationship between michael connor michael campbell and his estranged irish girlfriend grace mckenna michael down on his luck decides to make a documentary replaying his whole relationship and what went wrong he exploits his friendship with an actor he met at the gym nadia nadia who he gets to play grace the concept of this film is very original michaels relationship is shown from every point whether it's a high or low michael campbell pulls off a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find grace if fact most of the characters pull off great performances except the puzzler the puzzler is needed to move the plot along yet seems too surreal to exist in a coffee shop his monologues are often overdrawn and pointless this is proved when he says out of this chaos we're all trying to create order and out of the order meaning but in reality there is no such thing as meaning something only has meaning if we make it have meaning br br the commentary saves this movie the commentary is done in the vain of this is spinal tap and has michael and his brother explain the problems they had while making the film michael offers a very funny self conscious commentary that makes for some very good belly laughs br br overall i'd give this movie a 7 10
<START> when i bought this film i expected to get a fun 1970's exploitation film instead i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy milligan ah andy milligan with his tight editing breakneck pacing and wonderfully well known actors you'd almost think you're watching one of his home movies seriously i couldn't even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it the scenes of boring people dragged on an on and whenever someone got killed the film would slow down sometimes it would speed up too making the characters voices sound like chipmunks which was probably the best thing about this film the script actually seemed a bit better than the film and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over it's lines the cover said their prime cuts were curiously erotic but thoroughly brutal trust me there is nothing erotic about this film oh we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out but that's about it and as far as brutal well the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film and another thing
<START> people stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before during a dinner discussion of the incident the lights go out and when they come back on they discover that one of the guests has been killed fearing for their lives the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br there are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the old dark house story with the play within a play being its most interesting feature however the direction is rather ordinary which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production like most movies of this type there is or should be an ensemble of intriguing characters herein only old time broadway producer richard carle as herman wood and his fey secretary johnny arthur as homer maintain interest br br the ghost walks 12 1 34 frank r strayer richard carle johnny arthur john miljan
