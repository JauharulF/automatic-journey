<START> okay the title house of frankenstein was a reference to a line from the original frankenstein movie when they follow it up with a movie entitled house of dracula which makes no real sense you know that it's just beginning to turn into a franchise br br without explanation dracula is back and he's calling himself baron he infiltrates the home of a doctor with the claim that he is seeking a cure for his vampirism has a hunchback nurse who assists him what is it with hunchback assistants in these movies but what dracula is really interested in is his other more beautiful assistant at this point larry wolf man talbot returns again no explanation given and just happens to be seeking the same doctor for a cure to his lycanthropy and then he just happens to fall into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him which also just so happens to contain the frankenstein monster dear god when will it end sure the other universal monster sequels were silly but this is just ridiculous br br first the good stuff there are some great settings and the vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual some of the other effects are pretty neat too john carradine isn't bad as dracula once you get used to him but still nothing like as brilliant as lugosi was in my opinion onslow stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie although he has exactly the opposite problem to carradine all of the creepiness and none of the class none of the performances are that great but it's more due to the atrocious script than anything else the female parts are particularly badly written but stupid as it is it remains reasonably entertaining for the most part the best thing about it is it's short length br br now the bad stuff it's not creepy it's poorly written and it doesn't work i was hoping the three monsters would begin some kind of a supernatural struggle for power but it doesn't happen the focus is almost entirely on dracula who isn't particularly well portrayed on the other hand this is the only movie in which dracula infects another man but it is done via a blood transfusion rather than a bite as universal were always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext larry talbot is decent as always as the wolf man but he plays a comparatively small part once again the part of frankenstein's monster is reduced to the anti climatic closing moments for god's sake glenn strange was fantastic as the creature why not give him more screen time it's unfortunate that the series had to end on this note not counting the classic comedy abbott costello meet frankenstein in the end it just fizzled in the sunlight and died much like dracula himself
<START> brilliant screenplay br br the screenplay is very tight that u will be gelled in seat br br this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no story needed br br story is very simple that u can write in one line but screenplay was amazing br br brilliant performance by vijay and br br though plot is similar to director adapted only the plot tamil version is much fast paced than telugu br br movie travels straight without any chance of deviation though u can understand each and every characters back drop br br keep going
<START> flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family it's obviously not a great movie free willy looks much better almost in every component of film making possibly at times it becomes a bit naive and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography including underwater shots and some important moral messages elijah wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor he can make bad movie watchable okay movie good good great and great movie becomes all time classic paul hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role as i already say above whole cinematography was very good but underwater shots definitely is the best parts so flipper is a perfect way if you want to see nice sweet and entertaining movie if you like me become sick and tired of modern hollywood trash filled with sex violence vulgarity and profanity you most likely would like this movie br br my rating 7 7 out of 10 feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here br br sorry for my bad english
<START> i've commented once on this chucky great but i had to do it again to say some things about the film when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater and that was a special moment for me because i cherish chucky the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness and the gore was shockingly great the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful that was a great gore scene and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s my pants the idea of having the seed of chucky was very very bizarre and shocking when i left the theater i just loved it and i could'nt believe it was real the bizarre and different qualities of this child's play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the child's play series it just had that intensely shocking bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell a sure out of here's how i rank the series 1 4 2 3 i loved it but not quite as much as tom holland's original child's play classic i can't wait for seed of chucky bring it on
<START> the answer no sadly not though miller and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treat the drama suspense romance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of 1898 a enlightening experience one for all the family
<START> hercules the avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre i can recall the charge against it made by critics it is a cut and paste of two previous hercules films with some added new material to make it appear fresh misses the fact that this cut and paste approach solves one of the central problems of the sword and sandal movies with most of these films the middle third sags horribly usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both queen falls in love with hercules and her evil brother plots against them etc it's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale hercules the avenger cuts all that crap from the source films and adds a rather brisk narrative of a hercules impersonator bullying his way into power it should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of fascism in italy this also sets up a fine final match between the real hercules and his impersonator br br in a focus i might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films for my money the mutiny scene here is much better than it first appeared in hercules and the captive women since it has been tightened with the reduction of several characters and their plot complications br br there are also floppy monsters creepy underworld atmospherics borrowed literally from mario bava an entire city destroyed and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing gowns since no one expects any of these films to compete with the seven samurai or even with the magnificent seven it seems a bit picky to hold the film's borrowing from other films against it
<START> the film starts out great with a mock instruction film about the habits of swedish housewives after that we get a detailed reconstruction of post war scandinavia with lots of amazing cars electronic equipment and interior design a minimal jazz score nice cinematography and stylish titling also there's some funny rivalry like in von triers br br sadly after the set up kitchen stories collapses like the twin towers on 9 11 actors who try to portray the emotion by just staring in front of them corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of i don't like white swans i prefer bears and wolves u ever tasted bear meat the music becomes cheesier than at his worst br br it's a pity the director put all the effort in this great set up just to screw it up after wards
<START> fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were dropped in reverse order on nagasaki and how these came to be and came to be in american hands is the story of this film br br the terms by the way are the code names of two bombs fueled with plutonium and uranium fat man was the plutonium bomb and that one was dropped on nagasaki and little boy was the one used on hiroshima br br the film is primarily a conflict between general leslie r of the united states army and physicist j robert oppenheimer who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under direction with two men from as widely divergent backgrounds as these were conflict was inevitable br br paul newman who all his life has been a disarmament activist plays general to his credit newman does not play a man whose views he would very little in common with as any kind of caricature is a military man first and foremost with an engineering background he wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally want in this greatest of wars but because of his background in engineering got to head the manhattan project which was what the effort was code named so be it newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort count br br most of us first became acquainted with dwight schultz from the a team as h m murdoch the pilot whose grip on reality is tenuous at best if one was only acquainted with the a team one might think that schultz had a great future in comic roles br br instead dwight schultz is one of the best actors in the english speaking world with an astonishing range of dramatic parts since leaving that television series j robert oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy the challenge of the problem also intrigues him later on oppenheimer got into a real bind because of his left wing political views and associates which everyone knew walking into the manhattan project br br some of the lesser roles that stand out are bonnie bedelia as mrs oppenheimer natasha richardson as communist mistress whose affair with oppenheimer got him in such a jackpot later on and laura dern as a nurse at the los site br br but the best is john cusack who as michael merriman is a composite of some real life scientists who might accurately be labeled as the first casualties of the atomic age his scenes with laura dern especially with what happens to him take on a real poignancy br br the debate over the bombs as the use put to them is still a matter of raging debate fat man and little boy presents the facts and lets you decide what might have happened if an alternative use of them had been taken
<START> pitch black is a survival story it's about how to survive in an hostile alien world against even more hostile enemies the task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group br br the plot of pitch black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations but what makes this movie shine above others is it's well written characters br br the group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others jack a boy with a secret fry a pilot having hard time with her own conscience johns a bounty hunter with a drug habit imam a holy man facing the fact that god is sometimes cruel and riddick a convict and a murderer learning to value others not only himself characters start to live in the movie they aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre you start to care for the characters especially for riddick though that feels quite odd he is supposed to be the bad guy in this movie the line between light and pitch black is very thin all characters are familiar with both br br other thing that works in this movie is the casting rarely do actors fit to their roles this well radha mitchell is suitable for fry cole hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for johns but the most impressive work is done by vin diesel he does great job as riddick in his hands riddick is quite creepy definitely very dangerous and also deep character just as he is supposed to be br br so how do you survive in pitch black keep your friends close and enemies even closer
<START> i just caught this on showtime not even fun in a bad movie kind of way one of the lamest monster flicks i've ever seen plus the tv reporter in the movie was that annoying jerri from a past season of survivor the only amusing thing was that the secret base was the house from fantasy island and a million other movies and tv shows the place is located in the l a area i fully expected mr roarke and tattoo to come out and greet the visitors if tattoo had gotten eaten by the snake i might have given this movie a 2 but oh well watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the komodo or the cobra loomed over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster i nearly fell out of my chair though when in a flashback scene they brought in either the cobra or the komodo then normal size in some indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it wouldn't a wire cage have sufficed lol guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra i have to remember i rent showtime for their series and not their movies
<START> following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one this incredibly dull slow and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the bat hammy luis is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the aztec mummy the bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal flatly directed by rafael with a talky and tedious script by alfredo salazar and guillermo calderon cruddy continuity for example the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film but is miraculously alive and well here an excruciatingly sluggish script an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks a meandering narrative a crippling lack of action and momentum largely dreary going through the motions non acting from an understandably disinterested cast and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom this numbingly dry drippy and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout
<START> such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors such wonderful scenery that was the ultimate escapism for those in a land locked sun deprived state many of the actors went on to bigger things another indicator that there was something wonderful sadly lost i lived in columbus ohio at the time with all of my now ex husband's very large family in a chorus of 'no no ' every time it would be yet again taken over by a baseball game broadcast br br someone who wrote here mentioned it was up against all my ex and i noticed was that it was always always always preempted by baseball yes fox really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever equal it thank you for the memories of it
<START> this is a joke right this can't be a real film it's not even a real video give any harvey milk high school kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this the film maker's can't be serious right is this satire comedy drama gone horribly wrong the script is about as single minded and dull as is conceivable ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay the dialogue isn't clichÃ©d clichÃ©d dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun but it doesn't and it isn't worst of the worst a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a carrying a frying pan like something out of a honeymooners episode whaaa i have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs one of the leads is an attractive lunk the other is not both can't even manage a convincing kiss so much for romance the supporting players are jaw droppingly over the top br br everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet most of the dialogue is mercifully unintelligible br br this stale cinematic fruitcake isn't even worthy of being the next rocky horror or a gay holiday installment of mystery science theatre 3000 it's just plain bad in every way visions of will not dance in your head they will trample your every expectation have an eggnog and stare at mindlessly at the neighbor's holiday lights it will be time better spent
<START> if sicily is a territory of the baroque with its doubling of perspective that's part of this movie's challenge to realism and it's an exuberant pleasure here outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors plus of course the actual bellocchio who has made some really great movies and shouldn't be touchy about his honor there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on i with somewhere there actual marriage sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery you already know this version of the island so there's no spoiler involved a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo
<START> how bad idea was to remake an almost oscar worthy film martha is much more better has deepness finesse and so on and mainly a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role martina it's a joke and ugliness with the handsome aaron and the whole atmosphere again a ridiculous effort from hollywood there are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well tried cartoon figures the films are getting much less interesting nowadays oh yes if you want to see a really good movie watch the original one it's definitely worth
