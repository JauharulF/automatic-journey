<START> i experienced for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results br br clive barker is said to have horror with hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat what an unfortunate thing to happen because like the inhabitants of this film seems to be misunderstood br br barker has created a cross breed of genre staples in this story it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible cue the child the practically klan like human pitchforks and holy wrath at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before as a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocative br br i pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as barker's fantastical indulgence gone too far we have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and mr barker make nice and devote some time to it the better
<START> i have seen over 2000 studio era sound films including lots of judy garland lena horne shirley jones and deanna durbin's own universal features plus a decent amount of live and studio recorded musical comedy and opera and i assure you no one tasked with singing in front of a camera and microphone or maybe anywhere ever has ever touched durbin's solo here mono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and all the kid from canada sings this bit from il bacio like she lived and wrote it herself and then happened to show up for a retrospective in italy late in her career not like a child who learned it from her music teacher br br if you skip this extra on the dvd or skip ahead to the garland solo you are just depriving yourself since this cheap mgm teaser just happened to capture one of the greatest performances of the 20c
<START> dead or alive final the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose dead or alive trilogy and connected mostly by its stars riki and sho and that each film has its share of bizarro world fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence is admittedly the weakest of the lot that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound for pound guts that director takashi miike takes with the surroundings and the material here he presents an overtly dystopian future however low key where a homosexual mayor dictator richard chen has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels there's also robots in this year of one of them is ryo a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth then a cop takeshi happens to be the mayor's top guard but things start to unravel on both sides ryo teaming up with the rebels and takeshi with his employer though blood soaked mishaps like a hostage trade off gone bad and with takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots not done in an alien mood mind you just suddenly as if in a the power went out and that he himself is one as well and it all leads up to one last inexplicable showdown between the two men br br strange that there's yet another film where miike has peaks and valleys here sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it but there really isn't anything to take from this story except that the mayor dictator is a dingbat with no back story who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control he also has along with him his love slave i'd guess in the hilarious non speaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues meanwhile we get the conventional sides to ryo and stories and they're never uninteresting just not totally convincing enough to hold interest of course miike isn't above having some fun like when takeshi michelle maria chen in to the water to get her to swim after a near assassination attempt on the mayor or in having the original rebel leader speaking english for no good reason at all there's even a playful homage to old sci fi cartoons at the start of the film but there's nothing very compelling substance wise with the exception of minor turns at becoming good midway through the film helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid and mostly miike's strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and sets br br it's like a grungy japanese alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects and i really liked the yellow green tint miike used through the movie as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes but as for peaks and valleys one sees this ever more clearly and the sci fi movie channel level of visual effects with maybe a few more dollars put into it during the climax this contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious freudian sensibility from the director even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance the way that ryo and takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films when it wasn't needed on the other hand in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like miike's where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual it ranks right up there with the best scenes in happiness of the katakuris and visitor q overall dead or alive final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself too seriously and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances militaristic decay and cultural hang ups put on pulp level display
<START> absolutely horrible movie not a bad plot concept but executed horribly clichÃ© storyline bad script so schlocky it doesn't even qualify for campy this is the kind of movie that gives sci fi a bad name
<START> onstage john adaptation of picture of dorian gray is a fine tribute to oscar wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed the acting however is brilliant sir john gielgud to his wilde roots as lord henry and although about a decade too old for the role he totally becomes the enigmatic life loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella jeremy brett is also strong offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil peter firth while not originally my vision of dorian handles the role with style and grace and later with a convincing strain of cruelty the supporting cast is equally fine gielgud's former of being earnest co star gwen davies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi makes a touching sybil vane the wit pathos and tension of wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen my only other qualm is with the hair styles many of them seemed out of place looking more like 1970's versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style overall however the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence
<START> this is an awesome movie and if you haven't seen it you should go to the video store right now and rent it first off the cast is superb not only does it have current stars like ryan philippe and billy bob thornton but it also has your stars of yesteryear like judge reinhold it also has numerous cameos by actors like jon bon jovi ted danson and jamie lee curtis second off the story was quite good also it was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie and almost made it dramatic it takes the drug situation in the united states and instead of giving it a comedic face like in half baked it has a true life lesson image like traffic so watch this movie if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see
<START> i think walter pidgeon was badly miscast in this film just not believable in the role barbara eden was beautiful and acted her part well enough no one else was at all memorable br br i remember the tv series spun off from this movie when i was a small child i even think i had a plastic that would and was great for playing with in the bathtub long time ago br br as for some of the other criticism i've read for this film it's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards the effects were ok for 1961 not great but ok as for the science that was ludicrous even for 1961 there's no excuse also the sub was awfully roomy i understand that the navy refused any help at all for this film so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea br br overall the film bored me and i'm a sci fi fan can't recommend this one grade d
<START> yes i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the whistling in the dark production number the sedate to outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing call girl is eye popping and will certainly make you giggle br br i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library
<START> fun movie the script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day john hurt is perfect as is jane alexander beau bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak the story is the true star based on a true story the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping east germany sucks you in and holds you joyous ending provides enough elation to compensate for script don't expect academy award quality but it's a great ride for the whole family
<START> i saw this film on tv in the uk some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since my interest has recently been by visiting hilton head the next island over from actually and reading pat conroy's excellent the water is wide with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised and consider it a masterpiece jon voight captures the spirit of conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy a hollywood rarity br br three things still strike me about this tale 1 the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same 2 education is about more than reading and writing 3 these kids were my peers i was 6 in 1969 when pat conroy spent his year on br br why this has not made it on to dvd yet
<START> when i sat down to watch this movie i thought that it might be slightly good but no it was a ok film not good but not bad for most of it but then you get to the ending and it losses all credibility they should have just left then dead they did not leave the last bit it did not make any sense if they had something at they beginning about a plane crash yeah but we didn't so it didn't work the first bit is ok and i give them credit for that but the rest is just plane bad and unnecessary if you are thinking about going and watching this movie don t it is awful go and rent something that is actually worth watching i give it 2 10
<START> has some really good music and performances kid creole and the james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunch etc but aside from this there isn't much more to it the dialog especially the narration by saul williams is actually pretty good but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal the latter being the leading role both still don't have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesn't have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending
<START> deep water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary the testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late 1960's and a ground breaking round the world yacht race the personal conflicts of duty to family self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films i have seen i was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed the story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters this movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense joy and drama
<START> i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person this movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me br br the dialog is poor the actors never look scared even if it's supposed to be a horror movie for example the scene in which kurt collects the bones of his former colleague he should be frightened but he looks quite normal the chick of the movie is such a clichÃ© the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene and by the way the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking in the box as a matter of fact i was thinking more of an ant walking around on the back seat of the car but it still didn't surprise me
<START> another stupid movie the quality of image is correct sound too music is middle the guy try make music like in halloween br br for one rare time producer director choose no anorexic girls it is cause this movie take one week to do and cost 10 000 does it mean when producer have money they choose all anorexic girls good question br br but girls in this movie are physically correct but they are not good actress neither guys too but maybe it's just cause the story of this movie have no value br br i'm sure we give 10 000 to some teen who like movie and they can create a better movie br br don't lose your time to watch this thing
