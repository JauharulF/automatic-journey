<START> this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c aubrey smith smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children from his younger days as a rake in his declining years one is american davies one english ray milland who looks about 18 and one italian nina there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes was has no appeal at all falling for davies br br davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few big entrances and of course davies is just gorgeous br br halliwell doris lloyd elizabeth murray guinn williams edgar norton and david torrence co star had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931 smith might well have been nominated he's just excellent in this this gem

<START> yes it's true that it was jessica alba who leads me to this movie because without her i should have never pick it br br but i find it long dull and above all unoriginal all along i thought that the story was full of clichÃ©s and the directing very boring so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person i take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies br br it's a pity because all good things were at hand malaysia is a beautiful jungle it was the british empire and the cast is wonderful jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time she has found an appropriate movie for this bob hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role br br the only positive thing is that it makes me open a world map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south asia you don't know where exactly ah the little plane flight with red lines in the indiana jones movie
<START> this was the third time i tried to watch this film the previous two times i found the beginning so sickeningly sweet and schmaltzy that i just stopped watching however now that i am a little older and more compulsive i forced myself to watch all the film and i was very surprised to see that i actually liked it quite a bit so i look at the movie much the same way i would look at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees that's about 21 22 degrees for all those metric lovers out there sure the water is terribly cold and shocking at first but if you force yourself to stay in the water you'll get used to it so resist that urge to jump out right away br br the film begins with a lengthy exchange between flynn and his daughter played by a patti brady some may find there conversations very cute and endearing though others may find them a bit hard to take since these moments are so gosh darn sweet in a way it was some amazing acting by flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having kids or acting domestic especially that he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this film now that's acting never say goodbye concerns the divorced couple flynn and parker and their mutual desire to remarry since they both love each other as well as their kid it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will once again tie the knot however there are some serious problems standing in their way lucille watson who plays her usual over bearing and controlling mother in law character flynn's girlfriend after all he is errol flynn and he is divorced so you gotta expect him to have a girl somewhere and a marine played by forrest tucker br br not unexpectedly all this does get worked out by the end and everyone lives happily ever after however despite it being formulaic and predictable the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch flynn despite his reputation as an action adventure hero is very good with comedy romance and it's just a lot of fun to watch him also the film has the ever scene chewing cuddles he's just so gosh darn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this type of film and despite the sweetness the film is pretty well written the bottom line is the film is fun br br so my recommendation is that you do watch this film and force yourself not to retch at the sickeningly sweet aspects of the film once you've gotten over this the rest of the film is a picture that is well worth your time
<START> this movie starts off promisingly enough but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm the set designs costumes and music were wonderful as close to perfect as one can get but the more i got into the movie the more i felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment not the audience although i loved looking at it except for a few brief musical scenes i can't say i enjoyed it the director shows enormous imagination but if he had fun with this film he failed to share that with the audience or at least with me i didn't get a sense of whimsy and i didn't get sucked into this universe br br a big cause of this was surprisingly zhang ziyi you can tell she's trying very hard but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish she's a capable actress but she has her limitations i've noticed in her acting that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co stars a flaw that creates a void of chemistry the language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters she and odagiri act as if they're on separate planets she's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that odagiri was ok but doesn't make much of an impression br br i didn't even care for the characters separately there really is a sore lack of characterization the only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good looking royalty without the compelling love story at the center of the film though it's hard to care what happens the film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting i had to rewind because after going into a subplot i couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized br br mostly i'm just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like the music and dance choreography are really great the supporting performances are uniformly excellent fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing it's just too bad the lead actors were so bland
<START> so many of these types of movies out these days this zombie flick falls into the major cheese category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead and day of the dead in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them but they were also good movies a low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time br br this movie had so so special effects and a very un even plot line the one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to transform into zombies in this one it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie yet with the ease this infection spreads you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for infection and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood br br the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didn't get bit when everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and were able to come out of it without a problem our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in i was laughing out load at that point unarmed having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch ok sure br br also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military they should have watched a movie like blackhawk down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations br br one soldier was a fat overweight special forces private lol that was a good one another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors even putting his weapon down at one point these guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie stripes special forces lol br br then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing the explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie it made no sense at all br br the only thing i liked was the anti bush jokes the military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and at the end it was the vice president from an undisclosed location giving the orders that was the best part of the movie for me
<START> the trailer to this film focused so much on the chain of course because it's so sensational that it missed most of the movie which is about a developing although rather simply drawn relationship between lazarus and rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other br br of course with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved however at it's core black snake moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along maybe it's just me though but i think poor lazarus should've had his story focused on more he's a hurting man after his wife leaves him but we never fully see how helping rae resolve her past pains heals him too it's just implied that it does in essence he plays the wizard that helps the young rae overcome her curse through a big ol' chain and some blues br br i like the story but i wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational the side characters were fairly decent if simple and i liked the music the acting was good enough although i can't be certain if the rae character is fully believable but that might just be my naivety br br all in all i liked the film but i wasn't compelled by it maybe it's that i'm too critical but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so while it all seemed very cool i could never truly buy it the chain thing was a little too far fetched for me still this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues 7 10
<START> extremely slow movie there are fine performances from all actors which is why above 5 score surya and are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we are shown this till it gets to a point you start asking is there a story then one day discovers surya's diary to find his failed college love story the college love story is totally unconvincing as surya is an arrogant senior who is always picking on bhoomika beats up her friend yells at her in public and despite being terrified of him she falls in love for him even after that he continues to dominate her using crude language i certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by bhoomika i don't think any self respecting woman will fall for such jerks in real life so decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax the story is extremely weak in its characters a extremely arrogant surya to bhoomika is the exact opposite with and there is no reason given for the sudden change in character again a extremely meek bhoomika becomes a big extrovert when she returns wonder if she had turned so super confident why didn't she try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone
<START> and with those words one of the great movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion talks' and she spoke those words in her first sound film an adaption of the eugene o'neil play anna christie br br unlike with some other players and some other studios mgm took great care in finding the proper vehicle for greta garbo many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of talkies their heavy native accents would get in the way some didn't know any english br br it was no accident that anna christie was chosen for garbo first of all it being authored by one of america's leading playwrights it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her secondly since the title role was someone who was swedish the accent could be explained finally a lot of the kinks from early talkies had been worked out even though anna christie still made use of title cards br br like most of work it's short on action but long and deep on characterization the story takes place on the new york waterfront where garbo as anna has come to live with her father george marion marion ran away to sea years ago when anna was a baby and marion abandoned his wife anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution br br marion of course is glad to see her he even kicks out marie dressler the old waterfront crone he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood of course both marion and garbo have their problems adjusting to each other not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by charles bickford who takes a fancy to garbo br br marion is repeating his role from the original broadway production the role of anna on stage was done by pauline lord anna christie ran for 177 performances in the 1921 22 season on broadway it's one of best known works and one that's revived frequently br br of course garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured greta garbo received an oscar nomination for best actress and the film also got nominations for clarence brown as best director and william daniels for cinematography daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes and brown created the mood around the waterfront where the film is set br br eugene work is timeless so anna christie even with a lot of the trappings of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do garbo also shows she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium anna christie is a classic all the way around
<START> the main character has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre film past he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally too long a movie too much time spent on inexpressive face too much road time one of the of tv filling time with moving cars trains etc long scenes of him doing trivial sometimes totally inexplicable trivial actions with neither reason or emotion his best friends joseph and domino are not much more their relationship based on sex this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase gratuitous sex domino and mother are the two characters who display some emotion but not much it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie is it indifferent acting indifferent writing or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting characters in this film talk very little to anyone it's little wonder their emotionally isolated which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other
<START> you gotta be a fan of the little man but i found burlesque on carmen dull unimaginative and totally not funny br br chaplin is retelling the story of carmen and plays a big role himself as don jose it's a story about men and the women they love although it's unclear why one would love such a woman as carmen as she is playing the men against each other br br as i said i didn't think much of it chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this one on the br br oh and i'm curious what the difference is between this movie and the 1915 version or is it just an imdb mistake br br on the whole 3 10
<START> not since harold and maude has suicide been so successfully used as the theme for a love story the acting by a top notch cast is terrific with a well structured script things progress at an enjoyable pace there are moments of black comedy but i would classify my suicidal sweetheart as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of dark humor the relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both touching and engaging the movie actually makes you question what is a normal relationship i highly recommend my suicidal sweetheart seek it out on dvd under the title crazy for love you will not be disappointed merk
<START> perhaps the wildest in alfred hitchcock's career is this straight out comedy vehicle by the director pairing carole lombard with robert montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has their marriage where do they really stand with each other br br contrary to what others say there is an element of suspense here the idea that these two miserable people might escape each other free to inflict their awfulness on some other undeserving mate br br it's funny reading comments here about how miserable lombard's ann smith plays out in this film because montgomery's role is as much of a heel he manhandles ann snaps at witnesses short clients just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name ann is overbearing too of course the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble bringing up things like what he did in paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet i forgave you that she says as if it was big of her br br for david a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his mistress before tying the knot for good for ann it's an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life br br the acorn doesn't seem to fall far from the tree as ann's mother is into apoplexy when she learns what david tried to pull oh my poor baby thank heaven your father is dead br br that's a rare good line in this laughless unlikeable comedy br br you can call this an example of the remarriage comedy in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be you can also call this an example of what roger ebert calls the idiot plot in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight american morality but can't really do much more with it than a scene where an older couple is by the sound of loud plumbing br br lombard died within a year of this film's release it was the last film of hers she lived to see what a shame it couldn't have been something better she was overbearing in my man godfrey too but in such a likable way you didn't just have to go with her you wanted to here she plays for laughs that aren't there while sadistically breaking david's chops again and again montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like groucho a study in br br the only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is gene raymond as david's law partner jeff custer who makes a play for ann and acts with honor and decency raymond underplays his many reaction shots and even a drunk scene all to good effect br br spoiler so decent a guy is jeff that ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting david after she him into a confrontation calling custer a lump of jelly jeff exits the scene leaving ann and david together for their future murder suicide here's one custer that managed to escape a massacre spoiler end
<START> this has got to be one of absolute worst movies i've ever seen in my life the writing and acting are just pathetic it ranks right up there with uncle sam on the all time worst movies ever made however when i see crap like this able to make it to video it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because i know i could do a better job than what the makers of killers did
<START> great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for 31st july 2006 uk there is also a scheduled release in states don't know the date can't wait br br below is my original comment br br i agree with all the other reviewers it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd br br the story line is gripping the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling br br over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns br br it's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production i'm going to e mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens who did the production was it bbc rw
