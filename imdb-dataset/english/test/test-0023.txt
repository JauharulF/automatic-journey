<START> fulci does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made answer yes cat in the brain also known as nightmare concert is fulci's last masterpiece yes it is no matter what some people will say about it there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci's movies br br fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself who plays well horror splatter gore director who thinks he is slowly going insane it's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here being fulci flick you need to know it's gory how much well pretty much i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore and believe me it's a hard to archive even the braindead didn't stop it is all about gore almost every scene revolves about fulci who after being hypnotized by evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from it's wounds forget the beyond or zombie 2 this is the goriest fulci movie now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie he is such a brilliant director some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where fulci says making gore movies is kind of a sickness ending is very good considering that fulci and most of the italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes if you are fun of the fulci make sure you check it out if you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat its only a movie ps some of the gore scenes within this movie chainsaw dismemberment full tongue torn out eyeballs torn out maggot infested corpses zombies decapitations face being in boiling water stabs in the shower to head throat slit many parts of the body and organs being toast aside hammer smashed face
<START> although it's been hailed as a comedy drama i found to be mostly depressing it's hard to imagine how spike lee could look back affectionately on so much chaos petty cruelty irresponsibility and mean spiritedness
<START> over the many years there are some films that just slip by hardly anyone views br br choose conner is one of those films br br this small gem played at some festivals had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in west hollywood making all of about br br it is now on dvd i do hope many more will now see this br br it is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician who influences a very bright 15 year old lad this politico also has a handsome nephew about 17 years old who befriends the 15 year old lad br br the above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs so is the film that is what i appreciated we do not get all the facts much is left to our own thinking you will hear dialog that makes this logical br br steven weber wings is our politician his role is slightly vague this is another point for the audience to ponder br br alex d linz is our 15 year old he was about 17 when they made this movie but easily can pass for younger he has been in films tv since he was a young child he is a very good actor is quite convincing br br escher holloway is the older teen this role is his first major part he too is excellent br br now i am saving the best for last the writer director br br luke is not yet 23 years old for a first effort a big thumbs up i do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career br br ratings out of 4 86 points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10
<START> pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then the fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a peter lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains a big plus jean is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job br br funny aside the people behind me in the theater kept gasping after every plot twist as if they were watching a 'real' spy thriller br br before the movie started a trailer for get smart was screened the preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate the jokes and gags from the tv series looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and gags of oss 117 though of course oss had its share of misfires the overall tone of oss however was not an insult to the audience's intelligence and the material didn't feel as it had been 'dumbed down ' i did get the distinct impression that if i understood the language i would have caught more of the jokes and one in particular the pistol gag was mishandled in the interpretation for the subtitles
<START> any movie that offers bonnie hunt sarah silverman and amy sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching and comic actor jeff takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut a sad sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him familiar as larry david's manager jeff on curb your enthusiasm plays james a still struggling 39 year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother his self esteem is so low that he can't meet women but it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving if the storyline sounds a bit familiar that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest borgnine classic marty about a lonely bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother in fact uses marty as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation br br naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version and silverman plays beth an off kilter sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben webster they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first graders including his best friend pert daughter penelope played by dakota fanning's look alike baby sister elle in a wedged in cameo and looking quite a bit like jerri blank sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue david plays luca a retirement home manager and his scenes with have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe almost stealing the movie is character actress mina kolb who plays james' pixilated mother with pluck and heart br br there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina gershon don't the set up is funny as well as sharply played bits by director paul mazursky as the snaky director of a candid camera type show smear job tim as the unsuspecting victim of that show and dan as the tough love convenience store owner with his rueful bouts of insecurity and self loathing comic sensibilities resemble those of albert brooks and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of modern romance and defending your life the one persistent problem i had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary the problem is more evident in the first half when is trying to establish the right tempo and the lack of real conflict adds to the regardless what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be that a significant other may be out of reach and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification
<START> i have only praise for this film from start to finish it captured the brilliance of stephen sondheim's musical i am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone this one however changed my mind i am an actor myself and have played sweeney and i know how hard this role is george gave a stunning masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him he won an emmy and that's something everything he does he turns to gold he is so good it will blow your mind why he's not in films winning oscars lansbury is also very good and very funny sara woods is creepy and wonderful as the beggar woman all in all a great video pick it up if you can
<START> this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too if you're anything like me and you probably are you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie one of the funniest parts is when gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like hansel and gretel then he and his wife go home with them the soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery inspection officer here and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably when i have shown this movie to my friends they usually say what was that so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies yippee this movie is so oop it's not funny anymore so probably the easiest way to get it would be online the first time i saw it was from a rental
<START> made with film stock left over from the production of nana 1927's sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned and that's the best way to view it jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes Â in a black explorer travels to a post holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'white music there are plenty of surreal touches be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hair the angels the girl telephones renoir and producer pierre among them or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but there's not really enough to sustain it for two reels an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions new dvdÂ
<START> i had a different experience with this movie it never got charming or delightful or funny for me one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the s spoken in the film another was the lack of choices re subtitles br br i found the lack of dialogue annoying especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling were there characters or only vague gestures was there even a plot br br on a separate matter i'm getting prompted to correct the spelling of dialogue with the suggested substitute of dialogue maybe this movie in its entirety including the imdb portion is designed to puzzle or amaze but i'm getting more irked than amused
<START> this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least you would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released however retro puppet master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story lack of any connection to any characters and dragged out slowly scene to scene no build up of strong plot very weak climax you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie if you can sit through the whole reel i never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their final chapter i hardly suggest watching this flick but if you must i wouldn't recommend making anyone else sit through it with you
<START> the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory br br that's reason enough for me br br she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films huge mansion near the jungle hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras and said parties becoming drunken orgies br br all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes and emanuelle beds most of them br br joe d'amato did not direct this one he just ripped it off and used the same cast s and did anyone notice the sexual images at the gas station and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes br br coherence hardly any but goddess gemser is beautiful
<START> i actually trawled through the entire set of reviews searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars they were few and far between which is utterly baffling yes i know it's a disney film and it isn't directed by christopher nolan but good lord this is straight to the bargain bucket nonsense they should've had done with it and animated the bloody thing br br and what's even worse is the fact that imdb won't let me simply finish my rant there because my review needs to be longer br br the awesome in game camera shots are literally taken from tiger woods tour golf on the playstation the story plods like a sulking school boy the multi stranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup and the grand finale is plain boring br br aside from that it really was the greatest film i've ever seen in my entire life br br good authentic looking costumes sets and sports equipment there i said it
<START> my original title for this review was going to be ending disappoints film triumphs but i actually thought about this one on the way home it is not the fairy tale most of these films are it takes turns that are different and while its ending is at first disappointing it slowly sinks in and hits the core on a satisfying tone br br the plot follows a man named james aaron curb your jeff who also wrote and directed a struggling actor who lives in chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love br br yes it sounds corny but it experiments with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable and actually makes you wish it were longer the ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying that's it but once it starts to take it's toll it really makes you smile br br it does have many tones of seriousness throughout but fear not for it is also very funny some scenes offer huge laughs and those who have seen jeff stand up will recognize a couple primarily when he gives a speech at career day for his niece's kindergarten class and bombs it begins on somewhat of a serious note that you do not expect but what follows is very funny entertaining and quite poignant as well it is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy and as i said before while the ending may seem absurd at first once you take time to think about it is a true joy
<START> extremely formulaic with cosmic sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy aw poor nyc lawyer he's just scraping by and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn't go out to find another job though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery winning delivery but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm at home problems are ignored until people storm out of the house br br the only character you want to root for is the final maid who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them the bit's not played for laughs br br sorry just too unbelievable and with a spoiler pat everyone turns 180 degrees ending how'd they get top notch stars for this if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite
<START> william m thackeray once said a good laugh is sunshine in the house when i watched take away i must say that the sun did shine in my house this film was superb the opening was very cleverly done the story held together well in a nutshell two chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a david and goliath struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that one br br the film was though very discreetly portraying contemporary australian ethnic stereotypes in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional anglo australian and italo australian stereotypes and how they found a sort of unity though adversity very nice br br i found vince performance as tony an italo australian fish 'n chip shop owner in his thirties to be first class his acting was very genuine and convincing through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence or i should say the soul of the italian australian stereotype which in reality is not too italian but not too australian either found that balance breathed into its lungs and gave it life br br the cinematography could have been better more shots of the local area would've been nice from what i can see it was in melbourne but where in melbourne to me it looks like somewhere between ivanhoe to though i am not 100 sure on that one br br i don't know why so many people are comparing this film to the castle though they have similar themes running through them take away stands in a league of its own br br i think the film was excellent with a capital e it has everything it's funny the jokes are great it deals with contemporary issues facing australian society the story holds well i loved it i highly recommend it
