<START> how unfortunate yet also fortunate that two films about pot the cave and the descent should arrive at much the same time sadly for the descent its release in the uk on 7th of july coincided with the very day of the london underground tube metro terrorist atrocity that killed almost 60 and injured hundreds not a particularly good night weekend to pop out to the cinema especially to see a scary as sheesh film about likable women being trapped in a deep dark claustrophobic underground caving system the two movies have virtually the same elements a half dozen or so characters lost in a previously unexplored caving system with no one outside aware they are trapped down there lots of water caverns danger then ultimately some vicious human like or human derived creatures determined to prey upon them where the two are so different is that the cave is unreal entirely unbelievable more alien esquire sci fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama the comparatively minuscule budgeted british film filmed in southern england though set in the appalachians is five pair of pants terrifying a heart stopping shocker so stomach turning that people walk out of screenings early in shock it knocks off the girls in any old order you genuinely have no idea what to expect next surely not her the descent is also lit in naturalistic manner making it all the more scary unlike the laughably lit cave which resembles a giant magical christmas santa's grotto with cathedral sized room after room dazzling in gloriously blue light from who knows where while the torches are employed exclusively in artistically lighting up the granite jawed heroes each more puppet like than any team america gerry anderson thunderbirds creation fantastic amounts of equipment are carried too yet despite this the impossibly deep voiced actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger drama or anything worthy of a horror film it's strictly pg rated and in this instance the actors peg out in exactly the order that everyone expects them to i quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character only getting piper perabo out of sequence the cave script is entirely by numbers unlike shakespeare a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in under a week take a typical exchange between the 'good white and black leads that goes how many times have we been in this situation before bud too many replies morris i swear you could hear my suburban london audience gasp at the obviousness the scariest thing about the cave is that at the end there's a clear opening for 'the sequel' 'the cave 2 or whatever be afraid be very afraid or instead catch the descent and be truly afraid very very very afraid rr
<START> first of all i wasn't sure who this film was aimed at it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find boring there wasn't really much to it bruce willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all he did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his unless you are a big fan of his i wouldn't bother and if it's the story you're interested in guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child i would go to see about a boy it has everything this film lacked humor sadness and reality
<START> the glorious edward gets to move up in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop those filthy swedish drama movies and head up stairs to the splatter and gore department excited along with his big for the new type of movies he soon will be going to edit he asks all sorts of questions about the wage his and lunch brake well not really edward is maybe quite the opposite calm stuttering guy on top of that he got glasses with the exception when he's insane i guess that created a much creepier atmosphere br br evil ed is with all reason a swedish movie but somehow a magical force came across the good actors and turned their lovely swedish accents into stereotypical american voices i guess that's some of the expertise an actor needs these days the acting is wooden as in they are inflexible not well hey what did you actually expect on top of that the movie has a jamming techno theme song sounds like its e type in any case this only makes the movie experience worse since i'm fairly harsh against this movie so far there will usually be a breaking point where i tone the level of happiness up but there's really not much to say the blueprints look good but somehow spelt coffee over it and partially destroyed it that's how i look at this movie if the movie ended where edward is taken to a mental institute and they the parts from where he goes insane and kills people the result would have been much better but that's just my radical view i would also like to see more footage from the lose limbs movies br br there are also illogical things to discover in this piece of movie let's to say that the actors really are american living in america why would they then work on a swedish movie like edward did and also that delivery man why is it that he never uses the which is located directly beside him instead he goes away with tapping softly at the door good old edward really got some good ears to hear all that while he is editing br br anyway this movie had its moments it's just a shame there were not that many but that doesn't mean i would not recommend it it's a rather cheap movie go ahead and buy it's almost like i see a pattern for the price and the movie on the other side if you like watching dubbed movies getting crappier by the second this might be it my verdict would then be a rock solid 4
<START> there is a reason chairman of the board got a 2 which is too high this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and i seen my share of rotten films chairman of the board stars two of the most annoying actors people today carrot top and courtney thorne smith carrot top just isn't funny anymore and wasn't in this piece of trash courtney thorne smith isn't any better just watch according to jim and you will see a prime example of what i am talking about chairman of the board got a 1 from me because that is low as you can go it is that bad i am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't on the imdb bottom 100 somewhere i would put this in the top 5 on that list but its slowly working its way there
<START> i have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie this is another gathering of monsters just like the house of frankenstein not exactly a masterful plot but universal needed to capitalize again br br dr edelman onslow stevens is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department he is working on the cure to keep larry talbot from turning into the wolf man somehow count dracula happens to drop by to get a fix on his vampirism and rounding out the good doctor's experiments is the restoring of the frankenstein monster's energy along the way the kind hearted doctor's blood is tainted with that of dracula br br john carradine plays dracula again this time he is more convincing lon chaney jr as usual is the soulful wolf man glenn strange is the frankenstein monster who has very little to do this outing also with roles are lionel atwill and martha
<START> the brainchild of comic strip pioneer alex raymond flash gordon was the grand daddy of all sci fi epics this serial is the first time flash was brought to celluloid life despite it's low budget this is a great space opera br br the story begins with earth doomed to apparent destruction when the planet comes hurtling through space on a collision course maverick scientist dr is headed off for the approaching planet in a self made rocket ship convinced he can do something to stop the runaway celestial body he gets some last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete flash gordon and beautiful dale arden once they reach their problems really begin they run afoul of dastardly emperor ming the merciless conqueror of his world who has some ambitious plans for earth br br the rest of the serial revolves around desperate attempts to save the earth the assorted alien cultures he encounters the allies he makes space ships he flies the battles he fights and the monsters he slays br br brilliantly conceived by raymond flash gordon features classic archetypes from legendary myths and fables of antiquity echos of famous tales like the sagas of troy and camelot and sherwood forrest are seen here you have the dashing handsome hero on a quest to save the kingdom flash the evil king ming the old wise man the lovely damsel in distress dale the seductive siren aura loyal allies plus monsters dragons and assorted beasties br br flash is a modern robin hood jason or beowulf ming is prince john or dale is helen of troy or or maid marion is merlin or odysseus or gandalf are the merry men or the knights of the round table br br you get the idea br br you can't help but notice how many ideas from flash gordon would later reappear in star wars the cloud city the ice world the forest moon the scrolling opening text from the second serial there are others but you get the gist the whole sci fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic br br buster is the perfect action hero and i personally think he's better at this sort of role than any of the current crop of action stars he also played buck rogers and tarzan br br charles middleton is the embodiment of diabolical nastiness as ming sure he seems a bit melodramatic today but that was what audiences expected from their bad guys in the 30's br br jean rogers is our hero's love interest dale arden and i had such a crush on her when i first saw this as a boy i can readily understand why flash always rushed to her rescue she's the quintessential good girl to counterpoint the seductive manipulations of aura the quintessential bad girl br br the supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulated their comic strip counterparts and despite the now silly looking fxs there was a lot of thrilling action in this groundbreaking serial br br an all around fun romp and the beginning of the sci fi genre in cinema
<START> well i saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other making off from vh1 too bad than this one it's pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park very interesting stuff br br it's also funny than this documentary portrays trey and matt like selfish greedy snobs creators who doesn't work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the show br br it also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode interview with the actors who brings character's voices and much more br br if you're a fan of south park i highly recommend you this
<START> in all this dogma fuzz please note that this is the danish masterpiece of the 20th century the humour the fate the sorrow is so clean so simple so touching br br this movie is a masterpiece go see it there's nothing more to say
<START> i'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic but i was so enthralled by it that i really didn't care the movie plays out like a fun lighthearted teen romp combined with a schwarzenegger type action flick it's packed with action packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well sean astin is fun to watch and i haven't seen louis gossett jr since i saw in theaters he is a fine underrated actor and i love watching him on screen i just wonder what he's doing now unfortunately he might be starring in a lot of those direct to video flicks hopefully my assumption is wrong anyway this is a fun edge of your seat thriller and i definitely suggest you check it out br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> it's a shame this movie is rated pg 13 it is really quite suitable for anyone though young kids might not follow it too well br br it belongs to that wonderful genre of serio comic ghost angel stories that would have to include everything from capra's it's a wonderful life to wenders's wings of desire br br the photography is stunning the acting first rate and wonder of wonders the tone is uplifting br br my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film the two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd all the ingredients of irwin's story are on his bedside table the symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me br br but what a lark my favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner this is practically theatrical in its magic a tour de force of witty acting subtle playful and positively rhythmic coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque br br northfork is funny touching gorgeous to look at magical with the above reservations and has not one single car chase br br an easy nine stars
<START> this is my favorite hal hartley movie all his movies are small gems i love independent movies and i hope hal hartley never goes mainstream or sells out what if the lord jesus did come back and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers it was nice to see p j harvey in a movie since i am a fan of her music don't watch this if you are a fan of cookie cutter hollywood movies you will be disappointed
<START> it would be something to try and tell someone what fata morgana is very simply about or maybe it isn't herzog goes to the sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals but this is just the broadest stroke it's a feat that you either surrender yourself to or you don't he gets into the form of the world around him entirely without a story bound only to certain aspects of written poetry as his camera shooting on supposedly discarded film stock wanders like in a pure travelogue one might even jump to that easy conclusion as he puts up these immense landscapes then moving to more rough civilized culture though not the actual 'normal' culture itself and to a point levels too abstract to be able to convey properly here sometimes it takes a while to get along close to a purity through the creation section but a purity in how parts are manipulated either by nature or by broken down machines soon the narration readings from the who by the way does the music for most of his films with the gradual procession of actually highly stylized shots adds a whole different level to it it's a hybrid film and it's not easy but the rewards are what best comes closest to herzog's idea of ecstatic truth images he's been out for his whole career br br one wonders if the images end up by the time the second section paradise leading along the words spoken or if it's the other way around you're eyes are moving along with the stills and pans and the wording is close to being religious writing but there's also the music choices how the bizarrely spare singing and low key classical music goes together with leonard cohen and blind faith i think each side ends up complimenting the other and it's something that still seems like it shouldn't work perhaps that's the draw to it the chances taken in going through desolate wastelands and the smallest run sections of any kind of civilized life in this case the shacks of the desert that make it so fascinating if only for the cinematographic sense it's a marvel too indescribable for the casual photography fan because of molds of technique and some of the strangest images of any herzog film there's pans there's long shots there's hand held while driving by the towns there's a bus dozens of miles away that via mirage seems only a couple there's full on close ups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about its radar truly classic gonzo comedy there's people holding still in fake poses and a man and woman playing inane music but most importantly it ends up feeling at least for me natural for the personal nature of the approach br br i'm sure only herzog would know for certain why he made this film as opposed to the simple 'how' he was already filming even dwarfs started small and he ended up going through many perils to finish it yet this is what makes fata morgana such an amazing feat it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it in actually watching it it's definitely unsettling but there's the temptation to want to see it again very soon after just to experience all of the ideas and realities turned abstracted strange vibes yes the word applies here it's one of the truly spectacular art films ever made
<START> this is the classic case of an excellent film being looked over by the american public simply due to the fact it didn't have bruce willis or arnold schwarzenneger as the lead man adrian quinn does a better dual performance thats right you heard it dual performance in this film than either of those have ever pulled off in their careers well anyway now to the review br br the assignment is loosely based upon the story of carlos the a 1970's radical who terrorized europe for years before finally being apprehended by french agents in this adaptation a us naval officer adrian quinn is on leave in israel when he is apprehended by crack intelligence counter terrorism agency and took in for questioning due to the fact he looks exactly like the this is the one extremely cheesey part of the film but trust me it doesn't detract from the great value of this film when it is discovered mr ramirez is not the however he is recruited by a hardened cia agent by the name of jack shaw donald sutherland who does his usual grizzled mysterious government authority figure routine but in a stupendous manner who has spent his life hunting the and the series of events which follow will captivate anyone who watches this film it is chock full of great acting without all the usual action film cliches and one liners and a great plot which will surprise anyone the three leading men quinn sutherland and kingsley carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes also kudos to the director and his staff the camera angles and cinematography are top notch especially in the action scenes the assignment is better than anyone renting it could ever expect its a pity the film did fairly poorly in the box office otherwise we might see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller br br 9 10 stars this reviewer highly recommends it to all potential viewers
<START> most of the silent films i've seen have been serious in nature so it was fun to see one with a comic touch the setting and some of the scenes for the beloved rogue were reminiscent of the hunchback of notre dame relative to the paris street scenes and the celebration of the 'king of john barrymore portrays france's greatest poet francois in a characterization that ranges quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantically tender that 'water into wine' bit early in the picture was rather amusing br br it seems that times never change and it's interesting to see the movie make a cogent observation nearly a century ago paris has it's fool to reign for one night while everywhere else has one all the time how true br br the appearance of conrad veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer i've only seen him as major in casablanca oddly one of his very last movies as king louis xi he's a monarch obsessed with crafty but suspicious and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he resembled brad dourif's character from the final chapter of the 'lord of the rings' trilogy not exactly exuding the confidence a king of france might be expected to bear which is why the ascendancy of duke lawson butt seemed all the more plausible until rises to the occasion to put one over on both rulers br br i found it interesting that the use of inter title cards was exceedingly spare used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story without them though one would have missed a curious nugget it seems carried out his exile from paris at the hostel of the lame flea br br the print i viewed was of exceptional quality the very first film presented in a one hundred action and suspense movie dvd set from mill creek entertainment that's saying something for a film that's now eighty years old it's great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie lovers br br one question did it seem like conrad veidt's king louis picked his nose on purpose or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room
