<START> or to the far side of the sun' as it is more commonly known was written with input by the late donald james and produced by gerry and sylvia anderson best known for their television shows such as 'thunderbirds' br br the international space agency discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and proposes a manned flight be sent there the committee balk at the cost and the project but when a security leak at the agency is discovered fearing that the russians might get there first the project gets the green light br br american astronaut glenn ross roy thinnes is teamed with british scientist john kane ian hendry after weeks of gruelling training the phoenix blasts off heading for the unknown br br three weeks later their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak mountainous landscape ross survives but kane is badly injured a light is seen moving towards them br br i will leave the synopsis here until this point the film has been gripping with excellent special effects by derek meddings and music by anderson's resident composer barry gray why it has not been issued on c d is a mystery but when ross and kane crash land and we discover the secret of the alien world it is a duplicate of our own everyone on it is the same the only major difference is that things are reversed it becomes less interesting and ends with a shattering anti climax i think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea in fact gerry sylvia later did something similar on their 'space show ross risks and ultimately loses his life in an effort to return to earth his earth but why the new earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered br br roy thinnes had recently done 'the television series and gives a competent performance pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ian hendry is good as but vanishes from the story too soon several actors went on to appear in the f o ' such as ed bishop and george sewell blink and you will miss nicholas courtney 'the from 'dr who' in a tiny role but the acting honours go to the late patrick as head of the character is not far removed from john the one he played in a t v 's 'the power game' webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch herbert contribution as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye amounts to little more than a cameo br br like i said the special effects are marvellous as are the sets so the film is worth watching but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet with a stronger script this could have been another 'planet of the apes' or dare i say it '2001 a space br br in anderson's productions he made the future seem like a great place an adventure playground where science was cool everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically sexy women and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world we are in the future now and people are still watching street' every other night how disappointing if a mirror earth really exists somewhere one hopes that is a better place than this one if all the women there look like lynn loring or loni von i will be on the next flight
<START> i think is a great and a very funny movie the story is so funny the daughter nicole brings her father andre in some very embarrassing situations in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the daughter pretends that her father is her lover you just have to see heigl is lovely as nicole perhaps too lovely i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone gerard depardieu acts very great in this comedy film he is so fun to watch if you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this i think you can see this film many time and you will still have a good laugh br br in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the girl pretends that her father is her lover
<START> it occurred to me while watching imaginary heroes that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves there must be something to this storyline for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another paradise and moonlight mile are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind although one could reach back to a golden oldie like who's afraid of virginia woolf to make the point as well it's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore far from it it's just that like any topic it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie clichÃ© a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them br br the latest such work is imaginary heroes a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and perhaps best known examples of the family coping with the death of a child genre the academy award winning ordinary people like the characters in that earlier film the seem on the surface to be the ideal suburban family until one fateful day their oldest son matt who is the golden boy athlete and thus the apple of his father's eye kills himself with no explanation one minor difference is that the son in ordinary people dies as a result of an accident not a suicide it is matt's younger brother tim who winds up finding the body and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way matt who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for ben the father becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt turning away from both his job and his family his wife sandy is the most complex character in the film a free spirited child of the '60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia she spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot smoking past br br as written and directed by dan harris imaginary heroes emerges as a wildly uneven film for every scene that feels real and authentic there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic one sometimes has the sense that harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay an admirable goal perhaps but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight we often find ourselves thinking oh come next for teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot button topics covered in this film the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse physical abuse sexual identity conflict life threatening illness even inadvertent gay incest it is this everything but the kitchen sink mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care br br that is not to say that imaginary heroes is a bad or unrewarding film much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st century is insightful original pointed and profound prime credit for its success goes to the actors emile hirsch sigourney weaver and jeff daniels who deliver incisive sensitive performances in their respective roles it is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts moreover harris in his direction achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout but one that is frequently augmented by some badly needed flashes of daring dark comedy br br imaginary heroes may appear unfocused and derivative at times but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching
<START> this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet pimpernel ever to be devised as a pimpernel fan i was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters but this atrocity is not worth watching even if you aren't familiar with the story br br percy for example would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway would never have a string of women in his bed marguerite never had an affair with nor armand with minette whoever the heck she is would not randomly shoot tony in the head name is not nor has it ever been paul they have completely eradicated any reference to the disguises replacing them instead with james bond esque gadgets and gizmos br br as to the film itself the makeup is horrifying the women look like clowns elizabeth mcgovern's beauty mark wanders around her face at random the poor pitiable actors have no script to work with so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper the dialogue oh the dialogue the dialogue is unbearable and whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance i counted 13 location captions in the first half hour before i gave up as if we can't figure out that the body of water between england and france is the english channel br br the film if i can bring myself to call it that since it's really just videotape with a filter is absolutely without redeeming value do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivel instead go watch the 1982 anthony andrews jane seymour version or the 1934 leslie howard film or indeed anything but this one
<START> this completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made very dark at times it reminds me a little famous thriller deliverance director jeff creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair all actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable so if you are searching for something creepy try to find this little treasure my personal rating 10 out of 10 p s this one is even more chilling than halloween
<START> i'm trying to understand what people liked about mirrormask i am an avid film viewer and film maker as i was telling friends during my lunch hour mirrormask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year just like the short the film missed its marks several times during the movie it made attempts at humor it sets you up for the laugh instead of making you laugh it leaves you feeling empty the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films they weren't funny unless you were five and the acting felt similarly terrible i've seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen and i've believed it but not in this film not for a second br br this film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty and though the script is totally workable and the special effects quite beautiful it has no heart to it and fails miserably i left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater i felt and miserable and still haven't gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from it i love independent film i encourage people to view independent films to support them but not this film this film shouldn't have been made at least not like this why did the director miss the marks so clearly they were clearly not just the humor but the emotions the drama even the lines were poorly timed and delivered it was like the film walked on three legs instead of four its steps are awkward and miss timed and it could fall over with the slightest don't see this film i don't care who you are it isn't worth your time
<START> the story itself is routine a boy runs away from home and ends up in a struggling music school for kids he convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school the film is a splicing of shootings over 11 weeks and leaves many amusing holes which the observant viewer may find for him herself br br however long the whiskers of the plot might have been the movie is justified by its music and acting there is plenty of music featuring classical works played by and by the orchestra one of the leading youth symphonies of that day and said music is excellent by itself it would make the picture worth viewing the conducting and scoring duties were put in the best of hands those of alfred neumann br br the acting is a study in contrasts the kids in the orchestra most of whom had little or no acting experience must have driven director archie mayo crazy looking into the camera overacting the parts that they had and following directions given to them but the spontaneity that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture the veteran actors were marvelous with the material they had to work with walter brennan was perfectly cast in his role one that he emulated in real life joel mccrea and andrea were ideal fits for their parts and the supporting acting was a veritable who's who of character actors marjorie main arthur hohl paul harvey charles coleman perry and porter hall in his typical role of the heavy all ideally cast and the bit players jessie arnold john hamilton marjorie wood jimmy flavin day the gravelly voiced lee phelps in his usual role as a policeman and many many more if you're a fan of character actors this movie will bring back a lot of memories br br overall the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended even if you aren't a fan of classical music br br
<START> it's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once but four times most movies require a certain suspension of reality' to enjoy but this one takes it just too far the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a middle country the us government drags its feet in recovering him leading the pilot's son doug masters to attempt a rescue mission br br the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one colossal joke in the movie you'll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f all the munitions the fuel the intel for the mission and so on security on this base seems to be a joke nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen year old kid is fully qualified to pilot an f 16 br br if that wasn't enough you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right since people like to see things blow up' not so several times in the movie doug fires off aim 9 missiles on ground targets aim stands for air intercept meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air he also fires off 15 20 missiles where the maximum an f 16 can hold is 6 aim 9's the movie also lacks continuity you'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions and in the next scene it has a totally different munitions package also doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches an f 16 will hold 500 rounds of and it's mostly used for self defense br br i could go on forever with plot holes flaws and outright wrong information from the movie but i won't bore you if you're in the mood to see a good air force movie your choices are rather slim most military movies deal either with the army navy or marines until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of saving private ryan' or a few good men' we'll be forced to watch movies like the iron eagle' series br br
<START> there are not many films which i would describe as perfect but rififi definitely fits the bill no other heist film has come close to it before or after the plot is simple but engrosses you it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it you care for all the characters even though they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws it's hard to imagine any other actor besides jean in the role of tony le when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony his answer and the expression on his face says it all while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie and rightfully so the film actually gets better afterward the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony's final ride towards his destiny to think that if dassin an american director had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was it certainly wouldn't have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through but he did achieve his greatest work because of it to the benefit of all of us i'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another there's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money leave the classics alone
<START> the student nurses is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career for the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress katherine scottie macgregor as the instructor miss boswell ms macgregor is best known for her performance as mrs on the television series little house on the prairie the direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by clancy b grass iii this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a softer side to life while appreciating the beauty of the female sex
<START> watching this movie all i could think of was maybe it gets better but after 20 minutes i couldn't watch it any second longer i don't want too wast to many lines about this but really its a complete wast of time all the actors say is c nt this that if you are still going too watch it don't say i didn't warned you maybe if you are an hooligan or something you might think its a tribute to your hobby again film is a term that encompasses individual motion pictures the field of film as an art form and the motion picture industry films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects
<START> i liked this film very much as i liked before the other movies by cedric all the actors coming from all over europe are very good and funny one can really feel the influence of amelie like in many other recent movies but it's ok
<START> in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included if you don't like burt you may still like this if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time being from atlanta it does hit home but it's also nice to see a cop action drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city chicago miami or la the film is funny at points with good plot good performances from a great supporting cast every character is real the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out a nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half it has some good old fashion shootouts fistfights no cgi thank god real action br br if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with every which way but loose any which way you can then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this it comes off great
<START> if you haven't seen the war at home let me tell you what you've been missing it's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could have only been edgy and funny in the 60's where america has grown in it's acceptance of race sexual preference religion etc this show seems to argue with that progress it's a backward step in america's evolution br br for example one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that the white daughter is dating a black kid from school this is obviously hilarious seeing as how you can't see that type of relationship at any mall in america i've lived in both small towns and big cities so don't give me some type of red state blue state excuse not only is this the joke but the father who is supposedly not racist finds this disturbing and asks his daughter repeatedly to break up with her boyfriend which opposes his he may sound like a racist but he's just dumb character br br if this isn't enough a second running joke is that one of the sons and soon to be metro sexual is ambiguous in his sexual orientation the audience learns over and over that he isn't gay but the father isn't convinced so he constantly avoids his son afraid perhaps that his son will hit on him as all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men who can't control their will the father always comes to some acceptance of his son once per show but usually goes on avoiding him in the following episode br br the only way this show can cure itself in my eyes is if the continuous exposure to these unnatural occurrences in life open up the father's eyes a little but that may be too much to ask and besides with jokes like these i'm sure we'll have hilarity in episodes to come like episode 13 father votes against women voters and episode 14 my muslim neighbor is a terrorist br br please drop this show fox we're living in a different world from the one your execs grew up in
<START> this week's surprise screening at gv turned out to be the horror movie the nun la seriously i think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles even though the story's about the character as described in the title who knows soon we'll have spinoffs like the monk the priest and others belonging to various religious sects br br the basic premise goes very simply that a ghoul dressed up in a nun garb so that it can lay claim to the title goes around killing ex convent girls there seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved as the daughter of one of the victims eva played by an eye candy icelandic anita goes on to discover with the help of a few good friends like a rip off of i know what you did last summer mentioned also by the way br br so as the body count increases it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred aren't they always heroine to uncover the truth and save the day delving into the sins of the mothers the movie did the unthinkable that with a dream sequence as the introduction i hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly and there are a couple of them in the movie br br in part the movie played at times like ju on gone wrong with the plenty of dark water references and they could have retitled this unholy water for the circumstances and plot points in the movie however there are plot holes abound so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply you'd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun and sets which look like they can rival recent thai horror movie dorm br br the acting's pretty forgettable with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented english and since most of them are pleasing to the eye the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witch hunt what gives hello got still got mood ah then again the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated sfx which has a built in ai of popping up every now and then in various fashion just to elicit screams from timid audiences the characters also break every unwritten rule in the do nots in horror lore so you know and expect their just desserts br br can you possibly enjoy this movie sure you can just ensure that you're watching it in a full house should be easy since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every frightening scene it's pretty fun and adds to the atmosphere besides what's going on the screen surround sound doesn't even come close br br think of it as watching an episode of scooby doo without the wisecracks and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a pg rating those could possibly have been the best bits now left rotting on the censor's floor board
