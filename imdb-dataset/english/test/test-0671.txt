<START> i read angels and demons about 3 years ago and i can honestly say to is one of the few books that i couldn't put down while reading br br the movie however was pretty much what i expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery storyline tom hanks plays in my opinion a much better role of professor langdon than in the da vinci code br br you won't have to worry about this being as bad as the da vinci code this is everything that it wasn't much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy if you haven't read the book no worries you will still find it very interesting and if you have read the book well lets say you might be a little let down because i found many scenes missing that i was looking forward to br br overall pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer but maybe not something too special for dan brown fans
<START> this is one of the most cerebral insightful movies i have ever seen the script language costumes scenery plot characters etc all are supreme you will not be bored i have watched intensely or even just listened to this movie while working so many times i have lost count scarlett ages gracefully acquiring wisdom beyond her years in the end this movie takes you from tara to ireland where her family is originally from and you see the results of another civil war played out there this time between the irish and english br br this movie depicts the double standards of men at the time a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and whores but not a woman if she is merely seen in a private place with a man society accuses her of impropriety and of course scarlett was always thinking outside the box breaking rules when necessary to create needed change help people and or survive br br scarlett's beauty definitely is to the bone her strength self esteem and wisdom grow as she ages br br i remember her lines when i am confronted with too much on my plate such as tomorrow is another day and the way she carried herself her determination and courage and have learned from her experiences this is a good movie to show your daughters as it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself and that men especially very handsome ones can have two sides and may treat a woman differently depending on how she acts and respects herself an attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches br br this movie is like therapy to me and it is better than gone with the wind the second part takes place in ireland and anyone who is of irish decent will cherish the scenery people and scarlett's character within it
<START> the wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture it is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more br br connery despite the thick scottish brogue plays the very well he inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot br br candice bergen in one of her early roles is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite mrs showing courage in the face of adversity and plenty of humour as well a marvelous film rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed
<START> new york attorney plots to rid himself of his senile mother after meeting an attractive available woman screenwriter robert klane adapting his own novel the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirty parts doesn't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness to him it's just an excuse for prurient comedy and scatological jokes george segal who in the 1960s starred mostly in war and espionage pictures had become by this time one of america's greatest sad sack comedians his nutty reactions and batty responses rival only his mother's segal is paired well with trish van and their moments of connection though also played for laughs are really the only sequences one can gravitate towards ruth gordon lovable as is she is simply around too much and more of her amounts to less this is one of the worst directed and edited films i have ever seen from so called professionals promising scenes which ultimately don't play out for the full effect are haphazardly disconnected from other moments which flail around endlessly causing the crass rickety movie to self destruct long before it's actually over 1 2 from
<START> set in a post apocalyptic future the new highlander is an effeminate little twerp named quentin macleod who is being mentored by a new ramirez while his little sister tags along on their quest to thwart an evil immortal overlord to do so quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord does br br in short this is pure crap much like the highlander sequels quentin is a fairly stupid character constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a woe is me for i am a reluctant hero kind of way and he never catches on to the fact that he's an immortal and can't be killed at least not easily ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart himself
<START> for anyone who has trouble with naughty mad or troublesome kids this is an essential programme to watch it is just the best behaviour documentary programme not just for tips but for the transformations the quite attractive jo frost is supernanny with fifteen years of experience she now has a programme where she shows a family where the kids are misbehaving very very badly frost is the nanny who does not let the kids win every episode they have young kids who are mad and very very naughty e g throwing things constantly swearing hitting relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences but every episode by the end of the show the kids are transformed by the parents with the help of frost from little monsters to lovable children it is just wonderful when the transformations are successful jo frost is an excellent supernanny it was nominated the national television award for most popular factual programme twice it was number 15 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 very good
<START> ocean's 12 br br 'if you steal fifty million dollars they will find you ' alan rickman as hans die hard br br this adage certainly rings true in this sequel terry benedict has been informed that danny ocean and his were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back the ocean gang need a lot of money and fast but cannot work in the states as benedict has made it impossible for them so it's off to europe to perform acts of death defying thievery whilst trying to avoid catherine zeta jones' super cop an old flame from pitt's past br br on their first heist in amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'night fox' a super slick thief with a legend complex he issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of uma thurman kill bill ii buried alive type sequence interesting well yes slow sort of entertaining mostly unnecessary scenes of character development plenty br br ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more situations and conversations too many damon's linus is more nervous than before the cousins are bickering as we knew they would bernie mac talks too much and don cheadle's cock er ney accent is as bad as ever i really like cheadle but could not abide this pitt and clooney talk like old friends filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds however what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was and as much as these actors work well together zeta jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole she simply doesn't fit and her chemistry with pitt is non existent br br the stars of this film for me however were vincent cassel as the night fox and soderbergh's choice of locations cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both his night fox is arrogant cavalier with other people's lives' danny ocean and a total contrast to the ocean gang this is where i think the film loses its way cassel and the european locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the american actors and the style of the first film we want slick brash and quick witted not gritty considered and intellectual this is where the film doesn't work br br admittingly you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this
<START> this is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s however if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot it doesn't seem to have aged very well br br long story short extremely drawn out slow moving confusing plot with run of the mill choreography typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick and constant plot twists that never come to an end by the time the film reaches its emotional climax i had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care br br watch it for its historical value as a milestone of chinese kung fu cinema just leave your expectations at the door or you'll be bitterly disappointed br br for hardcore fans only
<START> a group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex but they can't remove the tenants the tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever the guy with the ginger hair who goes every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting only to be beaten off camera make this essential viewing if you like to laugh at films rather than with them
<START> this guy is a real piece of work an angry immature boy in a grown man's body packing all the charisma of a rock he goes around to places most people would only wish to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possible br br give this job to someone else who actually appreciates it br br i could go down an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his episodes though i'll just highlight the worst crete while the locals are putting up seaside picnics in his honour this clown has the gall to act like a petulant spoiled child he complains about everything including the fashion sense of the people who live there what an imbecile br br when he went to sweden he spent at least five minutes feigning incredulity at a bunch of chefs who probably had better things to do than talk with some dimwit american like work because they didn't think abba was horrible everywhere he went he brought up abba this is the kind of talk you'd hear from 13 year olds who watch too much mtv br br when he was in new orleans he got upset that a certain restaurant had better tasting fries than his so he accidentally spilled some wine on them in order to ruin them what a strange emotionally unstable person br br the worst of it all are his clumsy voice overs where he attempts in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate he tries to use all these big words in order to sound like an author but he's really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him he has something to say that by the way is probably the one good thing about this joker's tv show it goes to show you no matter how inept you are as long as you take yourself seriously enough the world will as well br br then there's the way he speaks with local guides whose english is obviously only rudimentary he'll use vocabulary any writer as he believes himself to be would instinctively know will most likely not be understood by these people does he care no self important schmucks like this clown do not use language to communicate they use it to make themselves look important br br review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind attracts that of a low iq social misfit observe how the reviewer attempts to justify sociopath nature with simple minded childish excuses that hardly make sense may complain but he goes through 'a lot' and not only that he was to do this show but is trying to redeem himself a dolt attracts dolts and reading review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person who'd enjoy this utterly useless pointless show br br finally to add a bit of fairness to my diatribe i admit would have been momentarily amusing had i met him in a bar but as a tv host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures is a miserable abject hopeless grim and depressing failure br br a failure
<START> this film had a lot of potential it's a great story and has the potential to be very creepy but of course tim burton doesn't really do creepy films he does wacky cartoonish films and i usually like tim burton's stuff but i thought this film was really weak the best thing about the film and it is actually worth seeing just for this was the art direction the film has an amazing intangible quality to it the script was not good it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts and there was no building of characters i never really cared that people were having their heads lopped off by a headless being i thought johnny depp had a good thing going with his approach to the character but given that the script was weak he couldn't go too far with it and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina ricci's parts br br anyway it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction
<START> ah here it is a movie which is said by people to remind me of the epic trainspotting ouch was i a fool to believe that and ouch how my buttocks hurt after having forced myself to watch this c p from beginning to end after the first 10 15 minutes i just wanted it all to end or at least they could've put some nudity or action or cool acid house music into it to make it worth the time but no when i was through with it i put it into my cd shelf and i hope i will never have to pick it out again just to show it to some friend who is so anxious to see it that he she don't want to listen to my warnings
<START> i realize a period piece is expensive to make and that this style of shooting close framed shots to camera moving camera wide aperture shots washed out allows such films to be made for a price as a style it has advantages and disadvantages like any other it allows more period pieces to be made like any style it has its detractors and supporters there are probably even those that believe that this manner of shooting has an artistic basis br br if only some of the money saved could have been spent on the script for whatever style is used a film needs good writing and good acting br br the acting in this film is mostly very good the writing less so it is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book and much which is relevant to the plot is left out making for a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity br br if you have read the book do not under any circumstances watch it if you have not read the book are easily pleased and have nothing better to do there is no harm in watching it but be prepared to be disappointed br br it could have been so much better
<START> lucio fulci's don't torture a duckling paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small town sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys this surprisingly well directed film especially in comparison to later fulci's gorefests is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence the soon to be dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping bruno's near seduction by the naked patrizia barbara bouchet really has to be seen to be believed highly recommended especially in pair with my another cult favourite house with the windows that laugh 1976
<START> this story about a man's 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace directed written edited and scored by alejandro amenabar it touches you from the very first images and doesn't leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits thanks to alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best bardem is an acting animal one of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute as we used to do with the great old masterpieces the year's best film in all senses 10 10
