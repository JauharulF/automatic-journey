<START> yes the votes are in this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation but whereas ed wood's film for all its flaws retains a certain charm despite it all this film defines the word charmless to the nth degree in fact i'd suggest to the editors of the oxford english dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionary br br carrot top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill mr top as soon as possible indeed if one goes to amazon com and look at customer reviews for carrot movie and other performance dvd one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr top br br one other curious fact about this film i recall that mike nelson the head writer for mst 3000 in his book mike's mega cheese about movies good and bad said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldn't recall a thing about it including the title obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing mike nelson had to block it from his mind evidently in a later chapter in his book mike nelson had recovered his of this film from the review he offers mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory br br the only comment i offer about the film and it is not a spoiler it's simply god's honest truth it's not funny none of it is not even a nanosecond of it is funny
<START> caution several spoilers br br someday somewhere there's going to be a post apocalyptic movie made that doesn't stink unfortunately the postman is not that movie though i have to give it credit for trying br br kevin costner plays somebody credited only as the postman he's not actually a postman just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western america devastated by some unspecified catastrophe he trades with isolated villages by performing shakespeare suddenly a pack of bandits called the the self declared warlords of the west descend upon a village that costner's visiting and their evil leader gen bethlehem will patton drafts costner after much misery and numerous efforts to break costner's spirit he escapes thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three minute flashback br br we now finally get to the major premise the escaped costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman a number of the village people led by young ford larenz tate want to get in on this postman act which does not sit well with bethlehem and his bandits and costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of at war with the br br the idea of the versus the bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds the depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another the can destroy any one village but could not stand against all their victims united to unite the villages must communicate with one another and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the out of business so it really makes a lot of sense that bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers unfortunately eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him but instead your old standby cliche the one on one brawl between him and costner nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems all the mail seems to be the standard hi aunt debbie stuff played for maximum sentimental value br br the postman is one of the most predictable movies shot for shot that i have ever seen now i don't purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out what's going to happen next but here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort i just knew what was going to happen next whether or not i wanted to know after a lion is prominently showcased eating people a bandit seeking the escaped costner ventures into the bushes after a noise and we are then shocked when the lion eats him a bunch of villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad and one of the villagers sings out some famous last words right before being shot to my immense lack of surprise a covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie a man tells bethlehem that no sir you can't just take my wife bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting br br but it is rank cloying sentimentality that really undoes the postman olivia williams playing costner's lover abby is worst served she pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere she tries so hard it's heart breaking but nobody could ever have made the lines i have a gift for you postman you give out hope like it's candy in your pocket sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are another example is the scene where a mounted costner thunders past a little boy ignoring his proffered letter only to turn around stare at him for what seems like five minutes and then thunder back to pick up the letter why didn't costner just pick it up the first time no real reason it's just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kid's hopes and then restoring them br br schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the postman is revealed i sat thinking please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid surely that is too saccharine too obvious for even this movie then alas the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away and i held my head in my hands and thought somebody shoot me it felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throat br br gen bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal your standard issue post apocalyptic villain is the meanest toughest s o b in the valley bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others although some menace is thereby sacrificed bethlehem is credible in a way most villains aren't unfortunately will patton overacts and although we are told early on that bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of hand to hand combat actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous br br the acting is otherwise pretty good costner has done better but his razzie was an as mentioned olivia williams is very impressive larenz tate as ford does a sincere and credible job james newton howard's score is competent though short of the epic standards the movie was going for but it's not enough to save this film br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> i am amazed anyone likes this film i never walk out of movies but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster the white characters are saints and the asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless to the story they exist only as objects surprise characters of other races fare much better the twists and turns were laughable and predictable but if you're reading this you know that already paul haggis is a hack hollywood can't even do multicultural movies right do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest take on race relations harold and kumar go to white castle
<START> i never saw any of john leguizamo's stand up before i watched freak and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 i couldn't understand quite before spike lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamo's theatrics and the style of personal storytelling it's substance and style merging together but we get leguizamo's rants about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father even when things get dark in some of the stories there's something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not if something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality tics here and there but overall it's the kind of fun material that isn't heady but is so true to itself that it stings find it if you can
<START> ben a fine charles bateman his young daughter k t a cute and his new girlfriend nicky the extremely attractive capri are on their way to a birthday party for k t they unexpectedly get waylaid in a remote southern town where no one is able to leave and with the exception of ben k t and nicky no one can get in either to top that off children are disappearing and adults are being murdered at an alarming rate ben helps some of the locals sheriff pete l q jones tobey moore and jack charles robinson the local priest try to solve the mystery br br this early 70's devil themed horror movie actually predates the exorcist and combines a bad day at black rock type plot of a rural town with a great big skeleton in its closet with horror elements for interesting results it actually sent a few chills down my spine this viewing as it inexorably moves along its ominous path the moody and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and holds for the duration the ever growing sense of panic gives it a real kick some memorable set pieces include the bizarre opening of a toy tank turning into a real one and squashing a car flat not to mention twisted nightmare vividly and stylishly realized by director bernard and crew jaime mendoza music is subtly sinister and gives it that extra sense of eeriness br br the steadfast and professional cast does some fine work especially the ever engaging martin as the affable doc duncan and producers actors l q jones and moore br br just the fact that the whole plot is right under the noses of our heroes makes it that much more scary jack the priest starts leading them in the right direction but will they be in time to put a stop to things it's an enjoyable little chiller worth re visiting just speaking for myself i was able to appreciate it a lot more after giving it a second chance i can say now that yes it is indeed under rated telling a good story in an interesting unconventional and effective way br br 8 10
<START> this movie changed my life hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible and i still haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations and as brightly as the shines in this movie you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film if you haven't seen this movie drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy i guarantee it will blow your mind and if you don't like it then i just have one question for you gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and runs wild on you
<START> it's awful br br pretty succinct review i know but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a bewildered state wondering how the hell a film like that gets made br br the last time it happened was last years turkey to mars' br br salvatore coco is an ex con trying to better himself through self help videos endless seminars and betterment courses he lives by the catchphrases these courses expound br br he stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer played by nikki bennett and has an epiphany his new career is going to be that of a talent agent with the singer as his one and only client br br financed by his gospel singing girlfriend played by sasha he sets up shop and tries to relaunch career with results br br the talk' is the reason why australians are so contemptuous of australian cinema it is poorly constructed lame and way too long 111 minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the 80 minute mark br br every scene is too long and are very repetitive the audience is not given a character to empathise with a vital ingredient in a film like this supposedly about an giving it a go br br the downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure br br this film is a failure on all levels made worse for queensland audiences by its liberal and use of various gold coast palm beach location and its laughable use of brisbane suburb names like norman park and
<START> hilary was great as julie and pat was once again magnificent as mr miyagi but there should have been more references towards the other three movies i mean come on first off where's daniel miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie he could've helped miyagi train julie san on the flip side the music stayed true to the movie though with a little more instrumentation bass to accompany the wonderfully played pan flute it doesn't feel like a karate kid movie unless you hear that pan flute thank you overall a decent movie though we miss you
<START> i have seen this film on 3 different occasions on the first occasion i was bowled over by this film it appeared as a very kind film to me i hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing however my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film there is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and madam kramer there are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life dustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child's custody there was even a controversy on the sets of this film according to the master cameraman nestor there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mr kramer in order to show the intensity of his anger decides to break a glass hard luckily nothing happened to nestor kramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structure it also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved
<START> this movie clearly has an agenda which could be summed up like this never never cross the border either physical or metaphorical let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else let's pretend all are evil satanic or drug dealers all that is outside one's country's border and specially us borders is dangerous malevolent and people there will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else the based on true events is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or in this case just to help pushing the film's ideology down some naÃ¯ve throats out there the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories mexicans into disgusting people mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops republicans into the right wing morons democrats into almost hippie and so forth is there anything good about the film i hardly think so but may be you think differently
<START> i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women every episode their is always more white women then black one's as if to say white women are better looking then black women i would like for once see more black women then white and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice you are just a big hypocrite
<START> the kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant russ who has lots of money a good job nice house etc the only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice one day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears this gives russ a second chance to make things right bruce willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance the kid is a nice heart warming movie for everyone
<START> lazy writing bad acting and wooden direction lead us to a 2005 canadian made tv movie called hush not to be confused with about eight other movies using the same name tori spelling and her doctor hubby move from to his small hometown where they run into his old gal pal who decides she still loves him she gets pregnant with baby don't ask and starts knocking off anyone who might get in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame the actors playing the old gal pal and the doctor are not worth mentioning as they act flatter than flat tori isn't much better but at least she is something to focus on as the plot meanders here and there before arriving at a very lame and all too familiar conclusion watch instead the hand that rocks the cradle
<START> anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast i rushed home from school to see it now is of a certain age so i can only add my comments to those asking for a dvd release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered tv archive history if so many old tv series from the sixties and seventies can be released why not this surely the rights clearances can't be that difficult most of the shakespeare lines i can quote comes from this iconic series and i remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other's memories of the text peter rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen this surely was public broadcasting at its finest robert hardy and sean connery fighting to the death it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the bbc television's golden age come on bbc clear it and license it please march 2009 so finally the dvd is here and congratulations to those who have made it happen the picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought now all those who for it must buy it and relive those magic moments br br uk viewers given the series was made in the uk by the bbc using british actors it's strange that the dvd release is not available there on region 2 europe dvd and can only be imported from the us and played on modified players it seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth wasn't it released free ' so everyone could enjoy it
<START> this is a hard show to watch it's not something to sit back and relax to it kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons people get screwed over raped tortured and die like flies there are male organs everywhere there is excrement puke and blood oz is a brave show it brings up issues like racism homosexuality prisoners reality and most of all capital punishment it is in my opinion also successful in doing so unlike for example the single tracked medium br br it bored me sometimes it had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didn't interest me strangely enough i found season 1 to be quite boring if i had watched it while it aired i think i wouldn't have continued to watch it i love seasons 2 4 season 5 and 6 are watchable although i think it shouldn't be allowed to utter the words cyril and death row in the same sentence br br there are so many marvelous characters to root for the old guys bob and who i absolutely fell in love with from day one said and four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way augustus hill who's monologues tied the episodes together so efficient the staff with people like sister pete and ray also brilliant also minor characters that was only in for a couple of episodes or a few seasons but left a good impression as well br br my favorites are the o'reily brothers their relationship was the most gut wrenching and warmest i seen on television if there is anything i will always remember about this show it's them there will never be another pairing or what to call it that will make me ache so much thats why when the ends come for them as well it almost hurt to much i wish it would never have happened i wish i had never watched it br br but good one fontana i do recommend it
