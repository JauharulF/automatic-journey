<START> of all the seasons and episodes of the twilight zone after seeing all the great mind boggling thought provoking stories this one stands on top that's right this story this one entitled the hunt tops the large number of the finest scripts in television history br br true there are no interplanetary space flights no inexplicable cracks in time there is no living nightmare no sudden changes of setting there is seemingly nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with br br the main character played by veteran character actor arthur sets out from his cabin in the hills accompanied by his faithful hound to hunt raccoon because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight br br the man and dog soon encounter a large raccoon who hops on the dog's back and attempts to drown the hound in a pond the man jumps in to help his dog there is a sort of almost black out after which the pair are seen on the shore in a lying almost sleep like position br br calling his dog by name rip i think the old man sets off to return home when he arrives he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation he also observes visitors coming and going to his house paying respects and giving words to console his wife br br still seeming puzzled at the strange reception and goings on around the home cabin the man and rip take off on a long walk down the road where he remarks out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts he eventually comes upon a rather large fellow dressed in garb similar to his overalls hat work shirt they are at a gate which leads to an area where a lot of smoke is freely rising up the gate keeper is overly eager in his persuasive pitch in trying to get the man to enter rip sounds displeasure the gate man tells the old man that he may enter but the dog would have to remain outside offering to watch the animal for him the man will have none of it and the two continue on their way down the path br br after a little more hiking they come upon a second gated entrance where the gate keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him when the old man reports what has happened down the road telling him of how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the man and dog and added with no dogs allowed that must be a hell of a place the 2nd gate keeper stated that he was right that's exactly what it is br br our family had lost our 1st dog lady a mixed lab in october of 1981 about 6 months later as good fortune would have it the wife deanna and myself along with our 2 daughters jennifer 9 and michelle 6 viewed this episode on tv tv channel 9 chicago well it all made perfect sense to us at that time br br we're certain that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog would agree the episode still brings a condition of watery eyes to this now 60 year old writer
<START> it's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third after the third that was awful it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done
<START> dark harvest 3 scarecrow 1 out of 10 in einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time or so i've heard in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change even on fast forward and you will be reaching for that fast forward button it clocks in somewhere around eternity br br if you are familiar with own version of project greenlight this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local wal mart you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within br br the line reading i refuse to call it acting is uniformly awful this is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of schlitz the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast scars in the nude scene br br the story is awful the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by adhd middle school students and once again the line reading remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming is distracting beyond mere words avoid
<START> in the future a disparate group of people asleep aboard a commercial spaceship is forced to improvise their survival when the spaceship crash lands on a remote barren planet they already have one problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal richard riddick vin diesel in his first top billed role however they are soon preyed upon by a strange species of predator that thrives in the darkness and a rare solar eclipse is soon to take place br br while the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side it is decently acted and it is especially well made technically location work photography and design production as well as creature design are all very impressive it is not the most original or stimulating science fiction horror picture ever made far from it but it still provides good entertainment diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character it is not entirely predictable however and gets some points for br br spoiler br br having a more politically correct ending than most of its type br br filmed on location in the desolate area of queensland in australia br br a sequel of sorts is in the works br br 7 10
<START> you can see that if the flick ain't directed by his brother this is the best he can do and sad to say his best just doesn't cut it ice cream man is a very bizarre horror film that's a real blast to watch if you're in the right mood in the wrong mood it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones so please watch with caution br br clint howard stars does anything really star clint howard though as the evil psychotic bizarre yes all in quotes he's not quite any of these but he's getting close ice cream man who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them ick br br anyway the plot's really just an excuse to show of the well the um well it's a plot oh wait i know it's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos there's jan michael vincent and lee majors ii the sequel as cops tracking the elusive man o' ice cream and even doug appears as a supermarket clerk br br even better than that are some of the bizarre goofs in the film i really like the fact that for some reason instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy fat kid of the group they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes and the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene in which jan michael vincent's acting ranges from mildly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness these are the cops who also the ice cream man's place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck where of course the various bodies and such are kept oh well better luck next time troops br br howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him it's all just plain dumb and fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of the or gymkata you'll have a good laugh with the right sense of humor i love that one br br
<START> if you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this i have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy i get from it and man this is one of the worst this movie was so bad i had to buy the third online that one wasn't as bad which is amazing since it was straight to video this is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place i mean someone had to actually have read the script or many scripts i'm sure they made several drafts and said yeah that's it here's some money actually they probably just wanted to make a beastmaster 2 before they even had a script then went with whatever they had ack horrible so if you are a fan of really bad movies watch this one it is a true classic and film doesn't get much worse than this and if it does please let me know
<START> before miracle on 34th street maureen o'hara and john payne made this this this film i was going to describe it but can't find words for how badly this film turned out the subject matter of adopting a child and maureen's illness are both very serious and sensitive issues but that notwithstanding this could have been done a whole lot better than it was it was so extreme in its portrayal that it didn't come across as real at all probably its problem started with a weak script br br another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie see my review of a stranger in my arms the beautiful o'hara was often saddled with clunkers like this another being forbidden street britannica which i may review eventually br br if you have any emotional ties to this from childhood you'll be kinder to this rather lifeless colorless and lackluster film but for something along the lines of this maybe you can find its tv movie remake it has to be better it has to be
<START> i watch crap like this all the way through to see if there are any redeemable qualities whatsoever to justify including it in my clients' video libraries don't you watch this not even a minute of it unless someone has a gun to your head you will as i did moan groan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one dimensional characters all played by really bad actors would turn and shoot you dead br br even if you are the biggest sandra bullock fan in the world it is not worth even watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears br br i want to kick the asses of the sleazy marketing people who put sandra's huge picture on the face of this dvd box and have them thrown in jail for mugging me or something like that i really wish i had the chance to read a review of this film before i bought it br br please give me a call and i will pay you 10 to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it stinks up the whole place just kidding please don't call
<START> i watched this movie on tv last night hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly disease i was disappointed and i think the movie was garbage it did not seem real to me some of the acting was awful in particular that of the doctor she was about the worst i've seen the whole thing played like a cnn 'worst case scenario' even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn't seem sincere i have seen some disaster movies in particular those weather ones which are actually so bad they are amusing this one is almost as bad but it is not even amusing it is tedious and boring don't bother with this one
<START> it was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching the acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people i was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as raging bull and goodfellas in this movie a great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing
<START> right on i totally concur with all your sentiments and add these i came to my pc especially to post a comment on this dreadful minus movie i was going to say that in this day and age i am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a woeful movie but you beat me to it anyone reading this and comment trust me don't waste you time and money it's an absolute shocker the acting is totally pathetic the script is way worse and the so called special effects are a joke surely no one actually invested money to make this movie i really cannot think of anything else to say about this so called horror sci fi product but must pad this commentary to make 10 lines of comment in order to have it accepted for submission
<START> there are times i am convinced that the is the best sullivan gilbert opera ever but that is only so long as i'm not listening to be that as it may the is probably the most frequently filmed of the operas yes i put the composer first nobody says hammerstein and rodgers or hart and rodgers or and verdi or what's his face and strauss you don't even hear the names of for or gilbert was just the bigger name and the bigger ego at the time so they put his name first it's time that silly practice was put to rest br br anyway the is a compleat s g operetta it has some of sullivan's numbers combined with some of gilbert's cleverest lyrics it has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue it's got a wonderful degree of craziness and it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming br br this particular production filmed in a live performance in 1990 turns its imagination toward striking simplicity set in a british seaside resort toward the end of the art period it throws over the of the original entirely the result is costuming and setting in an eye caressing medley of whites grey and blacks accented by occasional bits of red and less frequent uses of yellow and green it takes some getting used to but it's really spiffy of course when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of japan you would be right to exclaim oh pooh bah did i just say that it's most gratifying that this fine production is now on dvd however one caveat the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy the tendency to superimpose images is alas annoying why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy fartsy stuff of that sort but it's the performance that counts the most we may skip the overture since although one is performed sullivan never wrote one true it may be so he wrote none for any of the but the overture doesn't even date from sullivan's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others as for the rest of the operetta it's first rate and supremely funny br br the ko ko here is the estimable eric idle who does it credit there is a tradition of bringing a big name into the role the was a u s tv production years ago in which ko ko was played by groucho marx with mixed results idle's performance is delightfully quirky he does taken from a county jail assisted by a tennis his i've got a little list is done as a speech to a microphone of course it has the usual updated lyrics which are much funnier than the usual run of such things and his delivery is positively hysterical it goes on that way throughout br br in this operetta it's important to have a good it's just no fun if you're not being at in style this has a fabulous in felicity palmer in her way almost as big a name as idle she bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich wonderful especially for a soprano and her costume not to mention her recital with franz liszt apparently accompanying poo is played by i have trouble getting around is somewhat un chubby shortness but is voice is undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette there is a nice touch during a minstrel where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of his nancy on his knee bear in mind the decree about flirting be that as it may is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on poo his performance does br br yum yum lesley and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly she and do lovely duets pish tush mark richardson plays his persona as something a and does it very well poo bah richard van allan is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water a role later done to death in american sitcoms you know haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children that sort of thing the richard is bloody marvelous with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyrics br br i don't recommend you get this as your only get a good traditional production as well so you can see what gilbert intended more or less in terms of staging that being said i'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once on the whole this is a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious over acting it's a dvd to treasure with dervish like maids tap dancing bellhops and all watch for the bellhops with signs
<START> count me as being one who is happy to see no hastings in this episode the poor man's dr watson does nothing for me as he simply drags down every scene he's in japp is often necessary to the story as the representative of officialdom and a little miss lemon is fine for seasoning but hastings swings from painfully dim to over mannered in different episodes if i have to sit through one more vacuous oh i say there i'll take the gas pipe br br as a general rule the more poirot you get in a poirot story the better every line for hastings is one taken away from poirot and i've never read the books so i really don't care about fidelity to christie's characters a lot of viewers reviewers seem to have a problem with separating the movies from the books if you want the book as written then read it i don't see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage theatre is not prose don't expect a transcription
<START> this is species already hatching into a beautiful model mathilda may a smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill br br the movie begins with a strong launch and infected by a bore virus throughout the middle to end br br the weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot story as you should have compared it natasha species got the same plot but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong ending br br this explain why patrick stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in star trek next generation he wanted to find more models in glass cage floating inside halley comet br br a must see for a science fiction fans
<START> this film is worth seeing since it is a classic in the sense of being the very first full length film released in the process of three it was not very good in its acting or story plot but can be a great movie quiz question from an historical standpoint it should be seen in the 3 d process with polarized lenses
