<START> bon voyage has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the indiana jones star wars films it's as if you're on a fast train or roller coaster br br it's billed as a romance mystery thriller and farce it's all of that and more including candid observations on the reactions of french society during the nazi invasion at the start of wwii and it's also an exhibition of juggling that involves 7 main characters the scenes all seemed historically accurate to my eyes and gave an excellent feeling for the period br br all of the actors were well cast and gave great performances but imo the most superb was that by isabelle adjani who played the role of an opportunistic self centered french movie star not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress perhaps half her age but she also played her amorous wiles convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees she's only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold digger her character and energy propel the film through from beginning to end it wasn't until i read roger ebert's review that i discovered she was 48 years old at the time of the film what beauty br br i appreciated the ending it's satisfying but lets you write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters br br as another user commenter observed do not arrive late you need to be there from the opening scene good advice br br i gave it 9 of 10
<START> the duke is a very silly film a dog becoming a duke but it's a very fun movie it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have but thankfully no bodily function jokes as so many animal movies feel compelled to have mostly it's just dogs being dogs and people being well people the 'good guys' are likeable and appealing the 'bad guys' are ridiculous and of course the pun of many jokes but there is something dignified about this movie for even though it is silly it's not out for every cheap laugh like home alone and others br br crocket simon and copper do an excellent job playing black and tan hubert who becomes the duke after his beloved owner a real duke dies for the most part they just act like dogs no ' or human like emotions and attitudes however they do stereotype poodles and hubert does fall for her just because she's a poodle come on these are dogs they have a different view of beauty br br overall charming fun and enjoyable
<START> in 1929 director walt disney and animator ub changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disney's laugh o gram cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year was hired by columbia pictures and decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color br br 1937's skeleton frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show that's about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it's not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra it's hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves br br directed and animated by ub himself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with a crucial difference did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before it is certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesn't mean it's necessarily a better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all br br however it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all executes it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while tune is effective and appropriate for the theme it's easy to forget about it rapidly while song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down flawless work of animation personally i think that with a better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as it's still a fun film to watch br br it's kind of sad that most of the work did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disney's main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies' films it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney's mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can't help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us br br 8 10
<START> awful awful awful show real world issues dealt with blatant unoriginality stereotypes galore what the hell is going on with the african american black guys eyebrows tyrone power awful awful awful awful awful show the fact that it lasted three seasons beggars belief this show truly is swill for the brain dead of mediocrity br br saved by the bell almost seemed humorous compared to this well upon hindsight no it's of the same banal ilk and therefore equally devoid of intelligence the only thing that it's missing so far is the jesus is god message the mentality and deliverance is the same yet somehow feels evil and soulless you can almost hear the tv executives buzz words at each other in fact i felt so incensed at this shows existence i felt compelled to comment br br awful awful awful show
<START> even though this is the first film by the broken lizard group it's the last one i saw having mildly enjoyed super troopers and managed to sit through the crap that is club and i was surprised to hear they did an earlier film now i didn't sit down with high hopes but was hoping for a funny campus romp my friend asked me to keep in mind they are younger obviously and its their first foray into film i did and was still disappointed not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the bl guys they were ok the whole film was tiresome clichÃ©d and frankly boring some of the other actors in the film were really poor at acting and the rugby game didn't even resemble rugby poor showing they improved drastically with super troopers and have declined since lets hope they get back on form with super troopers 2
<START> before we start may i say i hope you've already eaten when you're reading this why because after i'd seen this film for the first time the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'the end' had appeared on the screen so don't say you weren't warned br br fred sears might have directed earth vs the flying saucers an okay film and one of the bigger examples for tim burton's mars attacks but the giant claw is not that giant a film yes it's a prehistoric monster that flies in the air attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a parachute the beast is giant except in the scenes where it's considerably smaller but who needs consistent proportions in a movie scary it could have been but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from sesame street
<START> with a single act br br charlie wilson congressman a real character during the 90s when the communism on ussr the wall of berlin and the war on with the soviets broke over he did it a single denial for money and everything went down he should be remembered so here it is his memorial br br back to the movie funny dramatic snob politic or just boring anyways it's a smart movie about politic life about ruling the world and about above all a lesson to the world a lesson to every politic out there a critical point of view referring to countries who support wars with money guns and words br br lesson learned world isn't a nice place to live in
<START> jeremy irons and forrest whitaker are good actors but this movie was badly written first of all during the hijack scene irons sits too comfortably in his chair he appears to be reading something and rather calmly too perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes also the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown slow mo bullets flying how his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost his grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes then he decided to get revenge and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors he's a journalist for the stuffy economist rag and lo and behold they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys how do they know but what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging out but not the baddies who killed his wife and blows them away anyway so he's just a murderer he gets away and well i shut it off i mean i couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything and also i thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers instead he's going after their friends i guess or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around the suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame it's ok son crying helps he says to his son son says no it doesn't and father says you're right it doesn't irons takes on questionable roles like that one dragon movie he did he was excellent in brideshead revisited which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller
<START> as with most viewers of this film i'm an avid reader of the books the first 2 films have buck ray and chloe as the main characters but in this the second sequel they play second fiddle to louis gossett jr's presidential effort world at war is based on the meeting he has with buck in the book series br br the problem is this film is as awful as the first two amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play i won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series other illogical parts feature i really really want cloud 10 to make a good left behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2
<START> nice movie and tom does a fantastic job playing the guy in the girl's body she really does it well br br a sort of teen version of many other movies but well done br br well casted from matt to
<START> sheba baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that a grier movie gets all that the pg means is that pam doesn't take her top off she takes her top off in every other movie she's been in though so it is more exciting than coffy more action it takes off slow but by the time she's on screen the thrills have started like dolemite martin is the heavy trying to get sheba's father but she ain't having that she wages a one woman war against martin and his gang of cronies the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which i'm still laughing about i thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but i was wrong it replaces sex with violence and in a film that can only be good
<START> yet another tv show becomes a movie steve the office carell plays dimwitted agent maxwell smart in a movie that's so bad it makes the worst movie you ever saw become the second worst movie you ever saw the seventh rate story if you can call it that has a megalomaniac trying to take over the world it is so unfunny it is absolutely pathetic about the only thing anne hathaway does as agent 99 is look good she seems incapable of doing anything else bill murray has the fine sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds and a few faces from the tv series turn up in very small roles movie is supposed to be part thriller and part action film it is neither even though i really was not a fan of the tv series at least it was light years ahead of this piece of hit all this does is drag it through the dirt and cheapen whatever good memories we had of it thank god don adams is not here to see it keep it up hollywood keep making crappy movies like this and keep 'em to the multiplexes on a weekly basis no wonder the film industry is going down the tubes this movie is so rotten it's not even good for laughs if this movie were a newspaper it could be used to line the bottom of a bird cage there is absolutely no reason to see this movie a root canal is more enjoyable than this rating zero minus five stars unless you are a masochist stay away better still do what the title says get smart and save your nine bucks you will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gas with it put it in your car and be thankful you did not waste it going to a multiplex to see this bomb
<START> great premise poor execution cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food br br joan chen mercedes ruehl kyra sedgwick and alfre woodard should fire their agents
<START> ok so i know better than to watch movies on scifi er sorry syfy or or whatever it is now so sue me i spent my whole saturday doing advisory board for a i can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie i'd never seen rather than read proust in the original or learn how to play the br br which is to say i didn't deserve open graves of which i saw none incidentally were there any did i fall asleep why is it called this br br some icky visuals not many scares as with too many films in modern horror films no reasons are given apart from shared humanity to care about any of these people half a point though for the legless entrepreneur who was clichÃ©d but did have one good scene br br it all sort of plays like final destination delivered via a board game the game does have an intriguing look to it and it involves one of my favorite old conundrums i'll give it that much the drawback there is that the game possessed more personality than most of the characters br br as for the end if you didn't see it coming then i think you fell asleep somewhere back around the dawn of the genre
