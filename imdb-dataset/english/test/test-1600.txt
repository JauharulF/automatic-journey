<START> there were only two redeeming features about this movie the beauty of bucharest and its architecture and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form forget about the plot or storyline from the book they're completely absent from this movie in fact about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations if the film makers had made a good movie even though unrelated to the book i wouldn't have been so disappointed unfortunately they did not the plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks the acting is wooden and the directorial efforts mundane oh yes the way the bow to their leader is pure hoke i suppose a nod of recognition is due for the animal handlers the wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles
<START> there seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap tired old sex comedies out there that say the same old things about middle class couples sort of like friends but with more soft porn and no wit this film is no exception it had situations so familiar i died from deja vu people sat on couches spinning out clichÃ©s about sex and relationships check monogamy versus cheating with some woman man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman man check porn the baddies 111 check some guy girl in it who happens to be the only reason you're watching this rubbish check the lesson seems to be when it doubt make a tired old sex comedy about people no one cares anything about in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before that'll get your film made it'll even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad wig
<START> i loved this movie jack black and kyle gass have probably made one of the best comedies since up in smoke this movie has something for everyone rock drugs and satan what more could someone want i suggest this movie to anyone that wants to sit back and forget all the trouble in the world and have a good laugh even if the movie does not do well in the theaters it is sure to become a cult classic i do suggest anyone going to see the movie pick up the d's first album because a lot of the jokes are made only funnier if you have heard the songs such as obsession with sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil the movie still is laughs even if you have not heard their music but the songs are so great you can't pass them up
<START> as valuable as king tut's tomb ok maybe not that valuable but worth hunting down if you can i notice no one has commented on this movie for some years and i hope a fresh post will spark some new comments this is a film that i remembered only snippets of from childhood and only saw recently when i tired of waiting for fox to honour its own past and hunted down the korean dvd in english but with korean subtitles i won't go through another long plot description suffice to say that seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format left me agape at the vistas and the scope of the film the matte paintings still hold up and the palace sets are truly breathtaking but it is the smaller scale details that lend this film its depth and richness offering a glimpse into the lifestyles of poor as well as its elite the docks embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as pharaoh's throne room while errors abound on the large scale most notably the dynastic succession the details are more meticulously researched than the vast majority of hollywood's films visually it's not without its flaws the interiors are often too overly lit and colourful to blend seamlessly with the exteriors nevertheless this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in the small as it is in the large tedious in parts absolutely overacted underacted yes both though might be a more apt description too long absolutely not i wished they had spent more time with experiences in the house of death and among the and less with his 'romance' with though historically inaccurate yes that too but so was shakespeare nobody chastises him for it i appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next guy but ultimately it has to be remembered that cinema is theater not a history lesson
<START> a whole bunch of teenagers gather around to discuss their fears but an uninvited guest has showed up and is killing everybody off br br probably the worst horror film of the 90's camp blood 1999 is the only film that could challenge it for that title has some of the dumbest characters and situations to ever grace a television screen the so called surprise ending is awful as is the rest of this film mildly entertaining on a sooo bad it is good level my rating 2 out of 10
<START> is beautiful enough vanessa is beautiful enough i liked the storyline but i went in with the expectation to see lots of energetic hot salsa dancing i was disappointed there needed to be more dancing especially salsa
<START> i was very disappointed in this film the director has shown some talent in his other endeavors but this just seemed to be filler there may have been a deep meaning behind it but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys br br i would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one as i watched it i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period but it never did at the end of the movie i was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way i could only say to myself what was that br br there were a few really striking parts of the film but not enough to warrant sitting through it again
<START> the ultimate gritty heist film elements of bogie welles sinatra will leave you sweating satisfied in comparison it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films such as oceans eleven remake reviewed in such high regard especially in europe films like rififi must be shown spoke about and kept alive to remind younger pathetic critics what true classic noir is br br criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer
<START> i'm no jane austen purist but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say br br billie piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin wrong personality modern make up completely wrong hair there is no way a young lady of her age would have around in public with her hair loose and like that she didn't seem particularly meek nor put upon by the family and i didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind br br the picnic substituted for the ball was so low budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the section completely destroyed the point of the piece as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh so claustrophobic pink sitting room br br to those responsible if you haven't the imagination even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing jane austen br br it was about 10 mansfield park and 90 nothing much at all br br ps edmund was very good
<START> what can i say the little kid inside has always had great affections for the following giant robots giant monsters and a cackling megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts as an adult it's easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it's really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children's tv series strung together despite all of this i find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature tremendous fun if a little nonsensical at times
<START> i missed it at the cinema and have rented it on dvd if you get the chance i would recommend it as itÂ´s better than nearly everything iÂ´ve seen at the cinema or on dvd this year that isnÂ´t to say itÂ´s one of the best films ever or anything itÂ´s just iÂ´ve seen a lot of rubbish br br canÂ´t really add to whatÂ´s already been said except 8 10
<START> i didn't really think this movie was bad sure the detective kinda sucked at what he did and he usually happened upon capt howdy by accident but he got the job done capt howdy himself was pretty scary the make up artist did a great job i really liked seeing dee dressed up all geeky i laughed so hard when i saw that i personally don't see how someone can sit through crap like texas chainsaw massacre and call it a great movie and then watch which is more disturbing because a lot of it could actually happen with the internet being so popular and call it bad i personally think that texas chainsaw massacre was loads of crap probably one of the stupidest movies that i've ever seen i enjoyed it was a very disturbing movie because almost all of it actually happens
<START> it amazes me that anyone would find pauly shore entertaining he is basically one joke that gets stale real fast he has his little california jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of lame jokes mainly he is just obnoxious br br that said i watched this movie because i was up sick and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials otherwise i would have turned it off after 30 minutes anyway the film could have been ok if pauly could have just turned off his spiel and just played it as a comic actor instead of well pauly br br anyway i'm sure pauly fans will like it anyway but if you are not a pauly fan stay away from this crock of manure br br i had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 10 10 maybe it was pauly personally i gave it a 3 10 because they didn't have any mike in frame shots didn't drop the camera and the supporting cast was pretty good
<START> i ended up liking this movie but it was not the easiest to get through what makes the movie great is the music and the scenery the songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented a great job was done to show different settings for the rom people br br however the viewer was not guided enough a more in depth history of the rom people would have been nice only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given english subtitles in addition more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too it would have helped if there were a narrator too explain about customs dress and music
<START> though it hardly compares to other sci fi film giants like 2001 a space odyssey or close encounters of the third kind lifeforce does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements somehow despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same it manages to work because of a few highly different elements br br loosely based on colin wilson's 1976 novel the space vampires this film from director tobe hooper poltergeist the texas chainsaw massacre focuses on a joint us british mission aboard the british space shuttle churchill to study halley's comet led by an american commander steve railsback they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma and when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft they find alien occupants that look like giant bats later on the churchill reaches earth's orbit but no response is given from radio calls issued from the home base the space research center in london columbia is launched to rendezvous with churchill but they find the entire ship gutted by fire all except for the alien beings encased in glass who far from being untouched by the fire look absolutely perfect the aliens are bought back to earth and that's where the incredible happens br br these space vampires escape from the space research center and instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds suck their victims' lifeforce totally out of them one of them is the space girl a thoroughly nude vampiress played by mathilda may railsback the only actual survivor from churchill is bought in by the chief frank finlay and a british special agent peter firth to track may who is in telepathic contact with him pretty soon however the vampires have turned london into a scene of pure holocaust people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies and the threat by nato to the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large railsback finally catches up with may and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre br br undoubtedly disjointed unquestionably uneven but nevertheless worth watching lifeforce despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting benefits from some drop dead excellent special effects work by john star wars some of the best ever seen the other working element and a surprise one it is is the incredible orchestral score by henry mancini almost wagnerian in the same way john williams' score for star wars was and mancini like williams before him uses the london symphony orchestra to boot br br largely forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in 1985 lifeforce if for no other reason should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre there had never been a film quite like it before and there will certainly not be anything like it again
