<START> i think this movie actually has a lot of nice things to say about a lot of people johnny carson ted and it shows that letterman and leno actually liked and respected each other a lot treat williams as the half kung fu master half godfather like mike is terrific
<START> when i watched this crap it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire which is where this garbage belongs in a fire i don't even know what to say the acting blew the fire looked really fake andy the chicks exactly supermodels and lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie yeah happy birthday to me well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2 and to make things worse i have the whole set on dvd fire volcano earthquake avalanche all i'm missing is the awesome tornado movie which i hear sucks balls br br well until my next crap movie peace
<START> cinema's greatest period started in post war europe with italy's neo realist movement during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed france's new wavers caught everyone's attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in 1971 luchino visconti brought the art form to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing up not just of visconti's particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner task master than the visconti revealed here he's not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm und drang cosmos br br we will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav 5th symphony taking full advantage of ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like geeky mustache specs shaggy hair duck like walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies it's a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse br br cinema just doesn't get better than this i'll ignore the complaints from the ritalin addicts out there who say that it's too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns i e which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what it's mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew he spoke br br spoiler i guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with jet black hair dye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalk white face meanwhile off in the distance young the object of dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art br br dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie it's ostensibly in english but the dvd's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway br br
<START> recycled and predictable plot the characters are as memorable as the story line we came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old overall a disappointment
<START> i must admit this is one of cameron diaz's unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead i was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters br br both camilla belle and jordana brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters in real life this is one of those movies cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing she looked the part of the gorgeous rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause br br coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister faith little girl phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for europe as she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister's boyfriend br br great story and equally great location shooting around european i will watch it again
<START> i liked the first the grudge it really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice that something was missing from this sequel there was no creativity nothing new or original nothing that really sticks to your mind it's people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo and most of the time it wasn't even all that scary br br plot wise this movie is a dead end amber tamblyn is a good actress but she was given nothing to do and karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly i was also disappointed in the mother subplot i was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the grudge but she dies in the hands hair of that was such a stupid twist all in all it's difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die all in the same way and there's nothing they can do it doesn't feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them it's just boring because you know what's going to happen if they had anything to fight it with that would have added suspense even if they failed if there was any hope it would make the scares more justified now you're just waiting for them to die br br was really scary in the first movie but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it i was still scared during some scenes but i actually got used to the huge eye and blue face the makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts yes i was scared at the school psychologist scene even if i knew where it was going as soon as she said i've been to the house a nice touch toshio however was not scary at all in this movie i was much more creeped out by the non blue toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie a blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me br br some of the characters seemed really unnecessary the notorious milk scene with the girl whose name i can't even remember comes to mind i wasn't scared it was just huh i'm not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed karen could have brought the grudge to the us with her it could have killed people related to her life everyone at the funeral or something like that even so it would have been dull to watch them all die but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying hated the i won't call you mother scene aubrey's mother issues were equally dull the little boy was a touching character though br br the ju on sequel was much scarier than this one it had some new twists dreams and reality blurring much more for instance and even if it left me feeling quite down i was also somehow satisfied i got to think a bit and be left wondering this movie only provided cheap scares
<START> i just caught wild rebels on one of the mystery science theatre 3000 archive compilations and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldn't make it entertaining there are some mst3k targets that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldn't possibly have been good movies like the green slime and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn't them in the execution wild rebels is a film whose basic premise did make a good movie three years earlier when don siegel directed his remake of the killers at universal both films are about a failed racing driver who's seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the woman's boyfriend only in the killers the driver was john cassavetes the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film was ronald reagan steve bobbie byers and willie are quite a comedown but what really makes wild rebels an awful movie is the direction by william note the accent over the final e present in his on screen credit which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point it's only a pity that someone didn't do a mocking commentary on this movie now in 2009 the comparison between steve hairdo and rod would have been irresistible
<START> i've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book i don't think any of them have actually read it edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view i've never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgar's vision maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story so if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals maybe a good cry see the movie i hope john carter of mars get's more respect than tarzan has we miss ya edgar
<START> let me get this straight the church has a safety lock down mechanism to keep the spirits from leaving but the ultimate solution is bringing it to the ground maybe i'm missing the plot maybe this guy is from the ed wood school of film making or something this movie is about as useless as the church itself hey maybe that's the point that whole rosemary's baby esq segment was hilarity i can go to my corner halloween costume shop and get better drag than that the entire film needs to be remade properly there were so many things that were played down so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling i'm not sure if the fault lies with the writing or editing but what i saw should not have this high of a rating
<START> are you in the house alone belongs to the pre cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows it is well made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations kathleen plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but is really scared tony bill and blythe danner play parents ellen travolta john's sister is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid it's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message is lovely if you are 30 or older you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters blythe danner who i usually don't like gives a truly moving performance nice little film
<START> this is a surprisingly great low budget horror comedy it's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending all the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus eric adam and justin urich harley had fantastic chemistry together one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom and harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a p ss in the truck and aimee brooks is just plain sexy plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time it's very gory but in a comical way and i thought it was very well written as well plus michael bailey smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup it's similar to films like joy ride duel jeepers creepers etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part this is a surprisingly great low budget horror comedy it's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending i highly recommend this one the direction is very good michael davis does a very good job here with great camera work good angles good use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace br br there is a lot of gore we get extremely bloody nose bleeds gory bloody stabbings guy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a cooked stew guts all over the place guys guts fall out pencil in the eyes bloody slit throat bunch of people walking around without limbs gory dead squirrel heads are squished severed limbs bloody and mangled corpses decent amount of bloodshed one very gory scene at the very end and more br br the acting is very good for a low budget film eric is fantastic here as adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with justin urich had some cool lines and i just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himself and he was especially good at the end justin urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend however i just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes i really dug him aimee brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with and like was especially good at the end as i loved her mysterious character michael bailey smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers rest of the cast do fine br br overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut this film looks like it was put together by a committee that couldn't decide if it was a comedy drama suspense or sci fi it starts out sort of playful then quickly gets darker and then at the end apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something it's totally weird and impossible to string together the acting is extremely uneven with the older professionals engaging your attention and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play this movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first run and art houses this would be a good film for a film class to analyze plot character theme consistency they are all either faulty or missing from this film
<START> this film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama none of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard tv movie stuff so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a jeff bridges fan as i am i guess br br bridges plays mike olson a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road his parents believe he is just acting out and talk about how he has no plan he assures them he does have a plan and that he needs to discover his true self and his place in the world so much so in fact that he invites them to go on the road with him and purchases an antique bus to travel in which he and his father repair in true tv movie father son bonding fashion up until about this point in the film i was somewhat interested in the plot and characters and i wanted to see how his stuck up mother vera miles was going to react to life on the road there's a funny scene early on where the father and son have to convince her to take the trip with them they show her the inside of the bus and she gradually becomes more and more interested finally departing in a huff with some kind of talk about curtains versus blinds on the windows bridges marvels to his dad carl equipped with radio announcer voice that she has changed her mind dad assures him electric oven works every time br br but the movie goes downhill almost as soon as they hit the road it turns out that mike's only plan is to introduce them to some friends of his who turn out to be random people who they meet at a hippie rock festival as soon as i saw the rock festival i was a bit disappointed particularly as it became obvious that the entire rest of the film would take place at the festival campground and not actually on the road but at least i thought there might be a decent band like well if they couldn't afford hendrix or the stones maybe they would at least have canned heat or little feat or something like that no dice apparently the only music at this festival is some horrible choral group with orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the fifth dimension coupled with an annoying announcer who's supposed to be humorous br br also we are introduced to a set of hippy and their various medical melodramas kathy renne jarrett is a pretty blonde girl with existentialism and nature on her mind who falls in love with mike before revealing the fact that she needs kidney to live and has run off to the festival to die and 2 other campers are determined to have a baby in their crude tent introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippy ignorance or something like that all in all the longer this goes on the more painful the film becomes for anyone hoping for any element of surprise or real drama br br basically this movie is a waste of time although it would probably amuse anyone who is really into the period of time in the late 60s early 70s and the films from that time i'd be just as happy if i never see it again though
<START> so boring you'll fall asleep after the 20 first minutes sorry mr i do admire your work all these beautiful films you directed such as sans etc but here the plot is extremely vain except the magnificent photography everything appears dumb and there's no envy to know what will happen at these medium actors moreover the dialogs are the famous question where are the children is repeated so often it looks like a farce believe me it's a pure waste of time concerning the plot and 3 hours is a long long time certainly the real reason of this box office total mess
<START> first time i ever saw this was at a friends house it ended up in his parents hands by a fluke some videostore bicycle repair shop went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs we saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed br br i've seen historical documents like ninja mission and plan 9 from outer space and they still remain good runners up in comparison to this one br br almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times in my circles i've showed it to all my friends we now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category the un one br br it can't be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene every take every move contains at least one mistake regarding editing dialouge directing etc br br for any cult movie buff this is the ultimate prize the gem of all gems br br as for craft it can't be rated because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings br br as for pure amusement it is the funniest movie i have ever seen funnier than any comedy ever made past or present anything less than a 10 10 should be regarded as an insult to good sense of hum our
