<START> it looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film but do i expected nothing from this movie just something to pass the time but i was hooked from the start two interesting premises a bank robbery gone wrong a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life how will these two stories collide just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot it has a great but unexpected ending and you are left wanting more always a good sign rent it or even buy it you will not be disappointed
<START> sharky's machine is clearly a burt reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to strut his talents and he spray paints the machine the film plot with colors from other films and other styles offering a variety of moods within a nourish story br br made in 1981 at minutes lengthy for the time period the film did well with box office at 37 800 000 it had a lot going for it burt reynolds actor and director a solid one two punch a william novel adaptation and the south land of atlanta georgia at this time a land of opportunity for film production out of hollywood br br reynolds' tom sharky falling in love with rachel ward's the hooker with a heart of gold is here echoed as it was in hustle when he played opposite catherine deneuve and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core but with downbeat ending not the hollywood happiness in sharky's machine br br the story is pure detective procedure actioner sharky a narcotics detective up a bust of a drug dealer causing the killing of some innocent bystanders and gets literally transferred downstairs to vice to deal with perverts and other m that cops consider latrine duty his new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants when some attention is pointed toward a certain pimp sharky looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute rachel ward is being shielded by police forces and political forces and sharky sets himself up a 24 hour surveillance force to watch her during the time he watches he learns that the current governor elect earl holliman is visiting as is a slick italian gangster victor vittorio gassman before the police can build a case with the evidence billy victor's brother a coke snorting gunman henry silva shoots through the door of apartment seemingly killing the beautiful but when sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate tiffany wells sharky confronts victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested sharky is captured by some ninja killers lead by smiley darryl hickman and is tortured for information to lead to but sharky overpowers them and arrests the governor and in a heated chase kills billy after he has killed victor br br reynolds wants to exhibit the inner workings of a hardened policemen falling in love but the police story plot flavored with noir element and reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships br br we come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their pensions in vice instead of fighting real crime this element of the film seems sketchy under reynolds' off handed direction and performance br br there is always uniqueness to a reynolds film he likes to hire stars either character actors or others and then allow them to improvise sometimes with varying results br br with his crew in sharky's machine he gets some fine moments and sometimes some overblown but always a sense of ensemble and good natured ness with reynolds as auteur it works br br reynolds the actor auteur always seems to be smirking at himself and the viewer as if to say it's all fake but good fun br br great line in the scene with victor when sharky throws down the gauntlet you're walkin' all over people like you own 'em and you wanna know the worst part you're from out of state this seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal br br reynolds made the film in atlanta at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and demographic br br the film did mark the appearance of rachel ward who was nominated as new star of the year in 1981 by the golden globe br br reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home georgia br br i got my dvd from half com for 7 99 and unfortunately it doesn't contain any commentary or making of features which is a shame maybe the next generation will have them br br the movie is still a lot of fun and both reynolds and ward are great looking actors in their prime
<START> i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didn t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel okay it s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it s still compelling much of my praise has to do with ken s performance as red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret it d be easy for to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way likewise the murders are very shocking but unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner there s actually little violence shown br br my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasn t taken in by the shock twist and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won t bother with a spoiler alert and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it d be a good idea not to make messiah 3
<START> i agree that this film wasted my time and my money the poster mislead me to thinking it was a different type of movie i should have known given the unprofessional look of the poster someone should sue for false advertising
<START> this was one of my favorite shows when i was a kid it had it all music stories a talking squirrel and chuckling daisies i wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing i'm 35 and i grew up in south jersey but we got three new york channels with our cable hook up and i think it was on channel 11 they just don't make shows like this anymore i know that makes me sound really old and it blows my mind that i grew up with only 9 channels on our tv but i could always find something cool to watch i've only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show she's three years younger than me and she grew up in north jersey i would love to see this series on dvd so i could show it to my 5 year old daughter and she could see what silly but great stuff her mom used to watch i just found a vhs tape of a few episodes and a music cd from the show on ebay and i bought them right up even though they were a little pricey i can't wait to get them to re live the great memories
<START> five years after the us civil war western folk are more concerned with the age old war between and cattle ranchers the cattlemen herd their wares from texas to the trail town of kansas there the cowboys find not only big money but also big confrontation with tall in the saddle marshal randolph scott as dan mitchell tries to keep peace in the town mr scott has experience between trail hands and saloon patrons he also juggles the town's finest looking women sexy saloon singer ann dvorak as rita and pretty church lady rhonda fleming as sherry boozy county sheriff edgar buchanan as bravo trimble offers more comic relief than sharp shooting assistance br br town begins with some promising symbolism and contrast gunshots interrupt scott and ms fleming singing a hymn in church then the camera switches to ms dvorak sexily singing her saloon number which causes a man to fire his gun in pleasure after that it really becomes quite a standard western it is somehow duller than it should be but not quite awful young lloyd bridges appears as one of the leggy costume is the film's greatest asset in it she is a real mover br br town 1 11 46 edwin l marin randolph scott ann dvorak edgar buchanan
<START> a man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire and must travel cross country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand a plot line that was later used to fuel hitchcock's classic north by northwest saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the master himself br br for any hitchcock fan the plot is a bit too familiar but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and here the likable and charming robert cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters not withstanding a troupe of circus performers a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone br br in terms of sheer originality and quality this does lack in some areas particularly the motive of the antagonists however there is some nice chemistry between cummings and his lead lady the much under appreciated priscilla lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by vaughn glaser the best part is the final sequence which perfectly mirrors what hitchcock would use later in north by northwest only this time the climax is atop a statue in new york certainly not his best but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for
<START> i really enjoyed this movie yes there was disrespect throughout the movie but bruce willis learned from the kid that there is more value in others and his life of disrespect needs to change this movie was a refreshing change from the trash that hollywood is trying to shove down our throats there are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie i really believe this was one of disneys best even though a couple of things could have been left out i was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual it isn't perfect but much better than most everything else out there
<START> archbishop desmond tutu who is seldom a favorite of mine said that everyone should see this film as it is something that can help heal the world br br it is one of the most poignant movies i have seen and delivers on comments i have read many comments and while they range from good to average to comments on the choice of actors the fact is that it deals with one of the most extra ordinary events in our world the truth and reconciliation commission for the first time a country has opted to air it's horrific history to find a way forward and to create a way for people to heal br br while the movie starts out with the white policeman being offered a chance to absolve himself for brutal crimes and the black guy is trying to ensure that he does not get away with it it delves into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we all need br br definitely a thumbs up to everyone involved once again i am proud to be a south african br br an interesting comment can be found here http www biz community com article 97 html
<START> the thing is john carpenter's best movie merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi horror movie br br by filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened the ensemble cast work well together with kurt russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard br br by building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror courtesy of effects meister rob bottin currently directing freddy vs jason carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched considering this came out the same year as et it could not be more different br br worth a watch rewatch 9 out of 10 br br p s the dvd is excellent lots of extras plus the best dvd commentary going with carpenter russell plus remixed in dolby digital for even scarier sound effects
<START> some years back this film had been scheduled for broadcast on tcm uk as part of a tod browning retrospective Â but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake my brother had watched it and in hindsight it followed the original pretty much scene for scene even down to the set design Â though no classic he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier br br this being the first collaboration between browning and bela lugosi i had high hopes for it Â but these were quashed when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the film's main concern was to appease the still novel sound technique and consequently the result is stagey and extremely static the thriller plot isn't exactly exciting either even less appetizing is the ostensible british indian setting with the characters' affected accents and upper class demeanor Â not to mention the over use of corny idiosyncratic idioms such as i say rather and now look here Â rendering the whole risible more than anything else br br apart from this there are a few unintended howlers margaret as a fake medium pleads with police inspector lugosi if anything his undeniable screen presence is already evident to give her some time to out' who the culprit of the double murder really is the evidence points to her own daughter played by leila Â she hears a tapping and is deluded into thinking that the spirit world has genuinely made contact with herÂbut then lugosi enters the room and in his unmistakable accent straight tells her i knocked twice Â you didn't hear me at which my brother and i almost fell to the floor in convulsions of laughter the editing is really sloppy too during one high angle shot of the main set a mike is seen being rapidly pulled up out of camera range Â and even worse are a couple of instances where a person walks off screen ostensibly into the next shot to another part of the each shot is held on the other actors for an absurdly long time so that it appears to take forever for this person to walk just a few paces br br the thirteenth chair marks the third non horror browning talkie that i've watched Â even if both this and miracles for sale 1939 deal with murder and occultism and could therefore still be linked to the genre much has been said about the director's apparent with the coming of sound however flawed though they may be the 4 straight horror films he did throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the rest Â which i've always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that browning wasn't as much at sea during this period as has been
<START> during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it something like is now taking off nazism br br so my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of nazism when recently seeing this movie in the tv version i had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this br br strangely enough i haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since i first heard it br br these are the things i found in four shades of brown in all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster br br 1 the worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them in the room in dealing with death and fire it's almost like a cheerful game to him the seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severely br br possible lesson the importance of showing the young adequate emotions when they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good br br 2 the magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair br br their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste the real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him his fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environment br br possible lesson oppression breeds bondage br br 3 the father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance he robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance br br possible lesson when no love given you cannot give any br br 4 the fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless with sadistic aggression here the ice cold nazi sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence it gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young head behavior when oppressing others br br possible lesson can nazism take birth in a pervert home br br can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic nazism br br very seldom does a movie contains so much it reveals little by little as i meditate on it i consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb especially the nice seeming bloke played by that turns out to be the worst of all
<START> in the mid 1800s irishman dennis hopper as daniel morgan emigrates to australia seeking a share of the gold instead mr hopper finds himself branded and thrown in a torturous prison there he is gang raped upon release hopper hooks up with aborigine david gulpilil as billy with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic bill hunter as sergeant smith jack thompson as detective and others eventually vengeance becomes heroism hopper is admired and assisted by the common people and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities hopper's scarcely human performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film mr gulpilil heads up a strong supporting cast the personnel involved in mad dog morgan make it not only worth a look but also a huge disappointment br br mad dog morgan 1976 philippe mora dennis hopper david gulpilil bill hunter
<START> this film was not about stereotypes nor dance moves nor pickup lines really this film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts it was hard to believe that kevin james could play in a convincing role that will smith could satisfy without action and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way i don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film it wasn't groundbreaking in any sort of way but it was a film worth seeing was it believable no new york couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the of hitch sure there are bar studs but not ones that can get any chick at any time excluding those raking in seven figures of course the thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things not just on the comedy it was a funny two hours no doubt but it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat become immersed in the characters and smile
<START> i had high expectations going into this film but alas i feel let down i bought it for 5 bucks at a used vhs place and the version i bought was the english dubbed version the dubbing is awful so beware lola just wasn't as good in this film as in run lola run and the bad guy just kinda came out of nowhere and lola starts to catch on to what's going on the second she gets to the university seems unrealistic to me i was also wondering if in the original version there were american songs in the soundtrack they seemed extremely out of place too bad for this film i really thought it was going to rock
