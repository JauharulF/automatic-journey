<START> that got destroyed quickly by the poor quality acting cinematography numerous pointless scenes and a terrible villain well let's see joe estevez is bad as usual but he isn't the only casting problem writer vivian schilling is no great actress in fact well she sucks her script isn't so bad it's just bad directed in fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been cast this could have been a really good film br br but alas with all of these problems fails to be even kind of passable as a horror movie plus the pacing is just awful too br br the mst crew had some fun with this one but it definitely wasn't one of their better efforts 5 for that nothing for the original
<START> almost certainly the best three stooges short with shemp 'brideless groom' is as good as any of the trio's best shorts featuring curly memorable stooge moments abound the opening with shemp giving voice lessons to homely untalented and lascivious miss dee green wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances is an excellent example of shemp howard at his best many considered him the most naturally funny of the stooges br br later when moe and larry try to help him get up to find a wife and claim 500 000 shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets flipped backward fixing the mirror he cries with relief there i pretty as a picture yea moe quickly replies trying to hem his slacks of an ape br br the best scene and maybe shemp's best with the trio comes when he pays a call on attractive young miss hopkins christine mcintyre mistaking him for long lost cousin basil she smothers him with hugs and kisses also leading to a hilarious bit between moe and larry in the hall not giving him a chance to explain his true identity suddenly the real cousin basil calls and she goes berserk slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of a poor Â Â woman that final line is delivered as she socks him in the jaw with a real punch according to shemp and crew members knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag what happened kid moe asks can i help it if i ain't cousin basil shemp asks before passing out br br other classic bits include moe and shemp getting tangled in a phone booth trying to find a lost coin larry getting slapped because of shemp's bad looks his face pressed against the phone booth glass and the great girl fight in the justice of the apartment the great emil sitka delivers his classic line inscribed on his tombstone hold hands you love birds over and over as his apartment is trashed br br i prescribe 'brideless groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the stooges' glory years ended when curly left true shemp didn't have as many great shorts with the group as curly but that was due to an increasing lack of support from columbia and his and the others' advancing ages when shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with they were still on the top of their game
<START> i just saw this movie for the second time i first saw it back in the mid 90's as a vanguard video selection it has retained it power br br it is interesting from several aspects one is that it is based on a true story two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors keanu reeves and crispin glover and three it has dennis hopper in one of his better social misfit psychotic character roles br br the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings you have characters in one on one family peer group school general society settings etc the story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each setting br br i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie i saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in california and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse br br this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental be prepared to feel unsettled at the end
<START> from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out it has this freakish feel to it everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you it is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other vietnam war movies what does push to such a high level is the br br the directing was spectacular here francis ford coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war most others just display and show you the horrors of war coppola though makes you feel confused shocked and scared these feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story this is something that i have only experienced very few times while watching a film the writing was of course amazing too it brought you write into the middle of the movie it never made me bored and this movie is three hours the cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm br br the acting was bone chilling just look at marlon brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded out of whack colonel when ever i think of a crazy gone made soldier i think marlon brando in now with brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes like the movie he was freakish to me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in the godfather martin sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal it is just a wonder why these two did not get oscar nominations robert duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming also duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable other great supporting performances were given by a young laurence fishburne sam bottoms and frederic forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clichÃ© also for once cameos were put into good use having dennis hopper and harrison ford who i both love br br i would definitely recommend people to watch this movie it has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best there is nothing more i could ask of this movie with its great acting directing writing cinematography and great ending watch and you will see why it lives up to its title now
<START> i loved this movie my daughter is 3 1 2 and a country girl at heart there are not any movies for young children i loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said stupid i applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie i rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection my daughter can not stop talking about it it goes along with our lifestyle we live in east texas i hope to see more family films like this one she even named one of our calves hokey pokey keen i can not say enough about this movie i look forward to many more films like this one
<START> hungary can't make any good movies fact this is a great example of that br br first of all the term plot does not exist in this movie it's seriously weak even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that sure it's about a taboo but that's about it there are endless possibilities which could have been really great if used but they nearly skipped everything i think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulness br br the acting is just plain shitty there aren't many lines so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimicking abilities but no in fact 86 of the time they suck and that's when they don't say anything if they say even a single word you'll start tilting your head saying that's damn unrealistic but than again this is partly the fault of the writing there's also no emotion in most of the dialogs br br the editing is sometimes ok but most of the time illogical and just worsens the whole picture it could have given an emotional push yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each other br br someone please explain it to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece calling this an art isn't gonna make it better sorry but you failed live with it even tho you probably won't care about my or any other guys opinion your child
<START> wagon master 1950 dir john ford br br production pictures rko radio pictures br br john ford brings the stock company out into the utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic no john wayne no conflicted anti heroes no psychological exploration no fireworks just a gem of a picture br br this ensemble piece nominally stars ben johnson as travis and harry carey jr sandy they're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of mormons led by ward bond are being shown the exit the group is about to embark on a trek to their own settlement but they know the odds and the harsh terrain are against them so they hire travis and sandy as wagon masters for their trip along the way they run into and take along a traveling medicine salesman and his two female cohorts alan mowbray as the doctor recalling his appearance in my darling clementine and joanne dru as his daughter tension is added when the murderous clegg gang comes upon the wagon train and there is also an atypical for hollywood meeting with the navajo br br most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals cultures first between travis and sandy and the mormons between ward bond himself he's constantly trying to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man between the doctor and his ladies and the mormons between the wagon train and the outlaws and finally everyone and the navajo there is also a classic ford scene of a rowdy dance which expresses one of his signature themes of civilization coming to the frontier br br again no duke here but i've found ben johnson especially the young cocksure ben johnson to have an engaging screen presence of his own he comes with his own backstory with that drawl and also when you see him doing all the stunt riding himself he's great here in one of his early credited appearances harry carey jr although having been around for a few years by this time is still pretty raw at times but he's likable ward bond is his usual marvelous blustery self i've found joanne dru to be a drag in whatever i see her in but here she's mercifully unobtrusive other familiar faces include jane darwell francis ford and hank worden playing like he will in the searchers a few years later it's not any more amusing here br br there is some absolutely spectacular b w photography by frequent ford collaborator bert not only is there the typical masterclass on the landscapes and horizons there is also some flourish in a handful of scenes with shadow and sun light the soundtrack features the legendary country music group the sons of the pioneers can't get more cowboy than that br br Â½ out of 4
<START> contrary to the comment posted directly below the big trail 1930 was not filmed in a three camera process much like the later cinerama that was the finale to napoleon 1927 a different film entirely the big trail was simultaneously shot in both 35mm and 70mm grandeur versions and both versions are shown on fox movie channel from time to time so it's easy to compare one with the other the grandeur version broadcast in letterbox approximately its original 2 1 ratio is more impressive cinematically with its wide angle panoramas but suffers from the same problem that beset early a lack of close ups forced upon director raoul walsh because of focus problems scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move closer to the players thereby achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer watching the two versions simultaneously one gets an accurate idea of which shots walsh chose to shoot close up in the standard version but could not in the grandeur version there are also a couple sequences involving el a shell game with ian keith and some business with his wife a jackass which are in the grandeur version but missing from the standard version br br for the record the big trail is the only one of three fox grandeur films which has survived in its original wide screen format the other two are fox follies of 1929 completely lost and happy days which survives only in standard format other studios also experimented with wide film at this time but the only other one still known to exist in both formats is the bat whispers filmed in both and 35mm and released by united artists other wide films were mgm's billy the kid 1930 and the great meadow 1931 rko's danger lights 1930 and the lash 1930 all of which can be seen in their standard format versions on turner classic movies kismet 1930 was also filmed both wide and standard but seems to have completely disappeared it is rumored to be lost br br why did wide film fail in 1930 theaters were reeling pun intended under the impact of the stock market crash of october 1929 and the spiraling costs of installing sound equipment and so were adverse to taking on the added expense of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to accommodate just a handful of films photographed in a variety of different systems that were not even always compatible with each other it would not be until 1953 when fox now twentieth century fox would try again and this time succeed with the introduction of wide screen cinemascope
<START> river's edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed american screen writer neal jimenez it is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of american youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives this is one of the most outstanding films made by american director tim hunter much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager this unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in american society those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor dennis hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast matrix star keanu reeves also looks good as one of the teenagers before he reached star status at a time when teen flicks are made without any kind of serious preparation it is hoped that river's edge cannot simply be ignored as just another silly teen flick it had massive impact on people who lived during turbulent times of the past when being an inhabitant of a sleepy town was akin to not having being born for today's generation with their heady overdoses of internet props such as facebook twitter and river's edge might appear to be outdated but its importance cannot be denied by any serious film admirer
<START> this film suffers horrendously from its direction julian grant and its incompetent lead steve guttenberg who's putting a solid effort to win a bruce willis look alike contest the writing is reckless hollywood action thriller sean bean whose one of my favorites david fraser and kim coates give a decent performance the film is definitely below average 3 out of 10 i wonder what hollywood studios thought actually giving the go ahead to weak director such as grant and i'd say to sean bean what were you thinking even considering participating in a film like this after such great films like goldeneye ronin and patriot games
<START> if you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting good plot good scripts novel ideas or being entertained you might want to skip this one i was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end but tried to give the film a chance and watched it all the way through only to be disappointed at every turn br br the acting was unbelievably sub par but i'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script the plot is very vague and underdeveloped and i think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it or be able to look past it in some way but honestly to do so would be a waste of time br br the film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie no one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of investment deal that is never really explained the connections between the characters aren't terribly clear and there is little to no character development br br this is either some kind of sub culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap but you can decide for yourselves br br i gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen but probably not the worst
<START> an ear splitting movie a quasi old fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star madonna's comedic attributes she does indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond vivacious parolee attempting to prove she was framed for murder a body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light big laughs after an energetic animated credits sequence which is much more fun than the rest of the picture we have nothing to look at but madonna's black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale what else is there griffin dunne seems defeated playing maddy's keeper while the poor choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue it's an unfortunate set back to the talents of director james foley who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s but even katharine hepburn in bringing up baby had a human side wretched from
<START> an interesting companion piece to true documentaries of john c holmes unfortunately it doesn't deal with what ultimately killed holmes and it certainly could have benefited from doing so burt reynolds and mark wahlberg got the most praise for this but i felt the true stars were julianne moore as the cocaine sniffing mother wannabe don cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as stereo salesman in some wild and william h macy who's wife is the ultimate slut not to mention a nearly unrecognizable alfred molina macy's new year's eve bash and cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie or at least the two best shot what this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms however none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives
<START> anybody who thinks this film is great desperately needs their head seen to it strikes me that this film was made as a joke it has no good points whatsoever the props cost about 10 and the entire set looks like it could fall down at any time why do films like this get made in the first place this also had two of the most annoying characters i have ever come across in the young boy on the spaceship and the redneck from the twentieth century this film is almost as bad as cool as ice starring the incredibly talented vanilla misunderstood ice
<START> who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series all is as good as morris' standards if you think that it is 'awful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you go to hell thanks it had to be said i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that haven't you got anything better to do with your time what are you trying to prove thanks for reading my heart filled review on the matter cheers
