<START> there is no doubt that the trail depicts a truly great event in australian military history the brave defence of australia against the cruel barbaric japanese army this film fails to take into account the story of the fuzzy or the new guinea natives that the australians used to help them carry out there military operations the film also fails to give a credible account of the australian soldier and his behaviour in this event it is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like br br again the australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in s history the film it deserved this is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography bad scripting and dialogue no character development and clichÃ© jungle warfare scenes br br it fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the japanese army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an ill equipped and badly trained group of australians fighting in a jungle br br the film failed as most australian films do to attract a significant australian audience in fact they stayed away in droves br br i am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an australian film i say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how this government funded film is just another failure by australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids br br i am giving it zero stars because its an insult to the descendants of these truly great australians and their enormous sacrifice what a shameful waste and disrespect and i know this review will provoke more negativity from the movie show crew and most reviewers but i have a right to my opinion and that's what australians fought for our freedom and that includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion
<START> i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i'm dying to see it again one more time before i well you know the interaction between the main characters after the tiger eli wallach captures his prey anne jackson in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious charles nelson reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean or department head is priceless how many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end this film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class race sex or religion and who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn
<START> if you want to truly experience the magic of don then check out alien factor or maybe fiend but not this alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy but which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor is just plain dumb actors sleepwalk through their roles especially mr monotone sheriff and the monster is some dumb halloween mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative but kind of stupid looking critters from alien factor a spaceship crashes on earth and there's a critter inside of course who runs around vaporizing people and ripping off arms etc and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too until it gets shot out of his hand and that's really about it alien factor beats this mess hands down if you really want to see a good don movie check that out instead and rip don 12 2 06
<START> like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre unexplainable moments along the way i was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late at night the rest of movie which is another 40 minutes by the way is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly ends br br baffled i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and i'm a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what they're saying someone's dream not real then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's not real or is it real i'm forced to make a choice either br br a the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and i'm simply too stupid to understand it br br b the movie is weird for weird's sake and just doesn't make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get it br br i choose b screw you guys i'm going home
<START> because it came from hbo and based on the imdb rating i watched the first season of this series what a waste the characters are occasionally interesting but mostly cartoon like the acting ranges from good to mediocre talent with a s t r o n g emphasis on the latter not only prisoners also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable it's such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong fortitude to keep watching the violence as with most of the developments in the story is titillating and whatever morality is supposedly served up it's of the lite variety if your idea of excellent television includes the the writing acting and overall production quality seen in the sopranos deadwood or six feet under avoid oz if you want to see a disneyland for illiterate jerks watch oz stuff like this gives edgy a bad name
<START> there's not a dull moment in francois robe it's surprising how much is packed into this short film while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette she invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach on returning to the beach they find that all his clothes have been stolen she lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl his gay companion is sexually excited early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended she suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance it's a light hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes
<START> a warning to potential viewers of this experimental film the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film projected the created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film however since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format i suppose you'll have to make do with what you can br br anyway this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire it's a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements as far as i can glean from the character names through a process horrifying and surreal begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic br br and visceral describes it not very much stuff happens in the movie technically but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are innumerable the very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses the sound editing and score in particular are immaculate and serve the imagery incredibly well br br fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through other cinema dvd experiments in terror i ii and iii movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract abject and non narrative rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe murderers br br polarisdib
<START> brilliant and moving performances by tom and peter finch
<START> in one of the best of charlie chaplin's short films he places the little fellow in the trenches of wwi where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the drudgery of trench life where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to overtake the enemy and usually to their deaths it takes someone of chaplin's skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusing br br like all of the best of chaplin's films short films and otherwise this one is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of chalk on a board in the trench erasing one when he gets his helmet shot off the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette and of course the overtaking of the enemy all of these scenes are show stoppers reminiscent of the most wonderful chaplin scenes this one should not be missed
<START> ok it's watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do the suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though first in today's modern society do you believe college coeds get that committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a virtuous habitat volunteer who likes autistic kids and the 2 week romance blossoms into a letter exchange that leads to john's conflict of whether to re enlist right after 9 11 01 really he asks her what to do every guy we know was not gonna be sitting on the sidelines after those towers came down my husband was one of them and i love him and am proud of him for going john's character is so flat he's nearly expressionless the entire movie he's good looking but not spec ops he seems unsure not confident quiet instead of a hell raiser no tattoos gets into a fight with the preppy boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie and there are military technical flaws everywhere epaulets upside down the war scenes are dumb john and another guy heading off on their own huh then other guy gets shot and john drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before securing the area or back up arrival or even having their backs against cover it's a gunfight for god's sakes you don't stop fighting until its over heck i wanted to shoot john in the back back home when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine we hated her for removing her shirt in his presence wth break his heart and then tease him into adultery she's a head case best part of the movie is when he drives away from her at least he had some self respect and honor there overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love dismal
<START> this film contain far too much meaningless violence too much shooting and blood the acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor the only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars
<START> the only reason i gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out basically i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens any ufo's anything at all suggested by the title of the movie the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was this could have been used to the movie's advantage but i felt instead that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me finally how big was this cast's wardrobe i became so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasn't really supposed to be classified under poor comedy br br toe thumbs down
<START> i'm a huge comedy show fan racial humor is always a little risky but the greats like george lopez dave chapelle lisa etc pull it off perfectly br br they don't go overboard make the audience uncomfortable or cough cough steal jokes but i won't harp upon that br br carlos makes racial humor totally unenjoyable his jokes continually scream racial humor to the point were it's not funny or clever but it's insulting i'm not one to turn cold towards racial humor but his execution of these jokes is sloppy that cause people to recoil at his comedy br br his humor is only surpassed by his stage presence in annoyance i feel as though he's screaming at me constantly and he runs around the stage like a maniac it only comes off as annoying
<START> the movie was good really the only reason i watched it was alan rickman which he didn't pull off the southern accent but he did pretty well with it know emma thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent i like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad another thing i have notice i have read all these comment and not one person has comment on alan 5 shadow which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie i would give the movie a 9 out of 10 another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasn't any sex still it was alright love the scene were he says aw sh t when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror
<START> since i am required to write minimum of 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only a single one i'll start with the following 1 i voted awful for this dreadful so called movie br br 2 let me explain why these turkeys mr david produces are shot mainly in my beautiful homeland bulgaria just in btw for the illiterate people around this country is in europe based north to greece and has absolutely nothing to do with mexico and uruguay some years ago nu image has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly direct to video releases why here because here they pay derisively low fees to the bulgarian crew and to the bulgarian actors most of them distinguished ones which are in many ways better than most of their american colleagues personally i am ashamed of that fact the reason is of course the of the americans involved and their wish to get most if not all of the profit actually it would't be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale there hasn't been a good picture shot here for years at present nu image is being sued here over the very questionably purchasing of our national cinema production centre called films no doubt about it there has been corruption there has been deceit there has been a lies in this recent purchase the bulgarian cinema is dead long live the bulgarian cinema
