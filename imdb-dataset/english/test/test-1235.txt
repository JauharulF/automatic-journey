<START> having had a great grandfather be captured and sent to during world war two i was hesitant to watch this when it was first screened on tv my great grandfather kept a diary whilst he was in captivity and when he died over there his mates bought it back and i have been lucky enough to read it and feel i have at least some idea of what was really like first hand br br this is a fantastic recount of what happened to those poor blokes who were sent to prison and shows what hardship and cruelty they witnessed in order to protect their country it is a terrific story of commitment and aussie spirit that never going to give up attitude it is worth watching if you like australian history or anything to do with world war two br br i enjoyed this mini very much and give it 10 out of 10
<START> this movie had a lot of ups downs the storyline is strong while telling the saga of barker growing up then her misadventures with her boys and the fbi theresa russell is very talented and her beauty even shines through as barker in public enemies the direction of mark l lester while not as good as in commando was still very interesting br br eric roberts plays a short lived part as a security guard turned thug and lover and alyssa milano plays a prostitute who hangs with the gang frank stallone plays a thug who helps out the gang while one of his exploits gets one of boy into trouble he gets himself out in a final way so to speak br br i was perplexed intrigued captivated throughout this movie so it makes me wonder what movie all these others who voted it so low watched for all those wondering umm the fbi was actually that bad in the beginning didn't have tommy guns like the outlaws had were thus at quite a disadvantage whenever they did get into with gang's of that era since everything i saw represented the 30's i felt it was more realistic than many other movies made portraying that era it is in may ways like a train wreck happening you don't want to watch but just have too enjoy
<START> the tender hook or who killed the australian film industry case no 278 this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential Â rose byrne pia miranda hugo weaving in a jazz era gangster drama Â and turns it into a sloppily paced and executed soporific weaving is a boxing promoter and gangster and functioning illiterate for no apparent reason he's given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before bouts how post modern how stupid anyway there's a boxer art matthew le who becomes latest protÃ©gÃ© over his unfortunately aboriginal stablemate luke carroll br br flapper moll iris byrne makes the goo goo eyes at him sexual tension under the surface miranda plays daisy a friend of these flower girls stick together who keeps turning up in scenes unannounced they practice dancing together and talk about hooking up with guys in the 1920s i stopped counting anachronisms after that there's a subplot involving japanese beer and a backstory of broome pearl fishermen i don't know what it was all about for some reason that is not exactly at all explained byrne puts cocaine in art's lemonade thinks he's a drunk and sacks him byrne plots and schemes to help him out again she's a big one for the plotting and scheming most of which causes trouble two gunsels portly ronnie john batchelor and russian donnie tyler debate bumping off when he realises their part in one of schemes but ronnie wimps out when he sees crying a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending br br director jonathan spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images but utterly fails to generate a sense of style which might have compensated for and decorated the wispy pathetically script unfortunately sense of film grammar the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposition is stunningly incompetent in an early scene daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists how she got there and indeed who she is seems to have slipped mind there are many more examples of this sloppiness where he chases poetic he achieves only wan irritation he gains awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable badly miscasting weaving and leaning on byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted doll like humanity whilst saddling her with an incomprehensible character br br it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with sprinkled pop culture quotes but it doesn't it's boring
<START> i really enjoy this film it is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or war on us i e the japanese and germans robert cummings and lane were excellent in the lead roles the supporting cast otto kruger alan baxter and norman lloyd were also outstanding the direction pace and finale held and continue to hold my interest so much so that i bought my own copy thank goodness for turner classic movies they show so many of the truly classic films including this one br br robert cummings was certainly no light weight as an actor and although i am a great fan of gary cooper and joel mccrea two of my favorite actors who were first offered the lead role i don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed bob performance br br this is a film that i enjoy watching and urge others to view
<START> in this horrible attempt at a blair witch mockumentary a bunch of people go to africa to investigate a creature called the half caste it's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of and that everything was improvised that can work if you have good actors which this film didn't br br this movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture as a result there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do quirky african stuff like eating elephant dung there is also some pretty good footage of lions eating from a national geographic perspective but there's not a single scare in the whole movie br br if you've seen cannibal holocaust or the blair witch project this movie will hold no surprises for you and you can probably watch better lion footage on the discovery channel br br definitely a half effort br br a note to the filmmakers guys do us all a favor and next time save the how i spent my african vacation home movie for your family and close friends nobody else wants to see it
<START> from all the rave reviews we couldn't wait to see this show we love wacky humor and creative material especially from australia and new zealand br br i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes but we just couldn't bear any more misery it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show it felt like 15 hours the songs may be mildly interesting by themselves but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work br br we're trying hard now to erase the memory if you want some wonderful down under humor in a delightful and engaging film see the dish instead
<START> two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other as they try and piece together how it happened they also embark on an emotional journey that for a br br building on his previous success with happy together and chungking express wong kar wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions yearning and unrequited love br br possibly in the mood for love is not to everyone's taste it wanders in rather lazily at not particularly long for a film but it appears longer because not a lot really happens but this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses trying to work out how the affair started i say cunning because of course this makes it difficult for the audience and the characters to tell what is in role and what is genuine br br if all this sounds rather arty and self conscience that's because it is unashamedly so and it is played to perfection by two of hong kong's finest maggie cheung and leung chui wai with some excellent support from ping lam siu and rebecca pan br br it is also a virtuoso performance by wong kar wai who treats the audience to a sensory and sensual overload bringing together christopher doyle who later deployed his lush over ripe style on hero and pin bing lee whose beautifully understated style can be seen on springtime in a small town was cinematographic genius it has all the bold beauty of doyle without frankly the athena poster cheesiness of his work on hero the music as always with wong is prominent from nat king cole singing in spanish to the haunting strings of the main theme it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images br br all in all a top film whether judged on plot acting cinematography or soundtrack similar to but more accessible than wim wenders' wings of desire this is a beautiful old fashioned story about love lost and regained br br and watch out for tony leung's hotel room 2046 which presaged wong's recent film of the same name
<START> a brief history of time is not only a documentary on the beginning and the ending of the universal and reality as we know it this is a story about the man and the genius known as stephen hawking it is his story that reflects the story of time and change throughout the history of the universal the style of the documentary editing style of the interviews begin and end with a quick fade to black almost like blinking in between segments and interviews the documentary gives you an odd feeling like this is the view point of stephen hawking and not the eye of the camera the running time is only a little longer than an hour it is a short story then again its subject matter could be talked about for days and days an interesting and proud story
<START> to be fair it has been several years since i watched the bile committed to celluloid known as here on earth so forgive me if my memory of the film is a little sketchy i'll stick with the main points which plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer br br scene one chris klein after having been thrown out of prep school because he looks like a seventeen year old yes very believable gives what i assume is his valedictorian speech to a field let me repeat that for you a field i think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence he is failing to express klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout he is a decent looking piece of cardboard but little more br br scene two after some joyriding and teenage pyromaniac hijinks chris klein and josh hartnett do some damage to the local diner of which he is forced to rebuild of course because who better to help with construction than some random moron who crashed into it burned it in the first place better yet let's have said random moron move in on josh hartnett's girl miss the girl he fancies for her equally wooden line delivery br br scene three chris klein's character is making out with leelee character and decides to name her various body parts after the states on the eastern seaboard my soul weeps really how can this scenario turn out well surely you must alienate several million people if you imply their home is equivalent to miss more erm feminine areas secondly naming her breasts after new york and new jersey prompts some confusion as to whether miss is actually freakishly disproportionate br br scene four leelee is running she falls down this gives her knee cancer we always knew it could come back her father says right knee cancer from tripping perhaps i missed something as i said it's been a few years surely i missed something didn't i for the love of god please tell me the girl did not contract knee cancer from falling down br br that scream you just heard was my soul dying
<START> this movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny this movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me i sure enjoyed canning those last night is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy comedy and am totally baffled by these positive reviews
<START> this was a very nice soft core movie for both men and women plenty of nudity sex but without the overall raunch you'll usually find they could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning trust me guys if you want to get your woman in the mood get something with bobby johnston in it and i'm sure lovely monique parent samantha mcconnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male unfortunately bobby and monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do please pm me i'd love to know the photography was much better than usual so was the story predictable but nice sweet natured and romantic at the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts i give this 7 10
<START> truly appalling waste of space me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end and i can count the films i have switched off before the end on one hand br br the script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring i wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983 for example the irritating threatening the real estate guy from his house phone i mean seriously the police would be beating his door down in minutes the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film the narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters oh and what characters they are the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful he could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed after 60 or so minutes of the film i had built absolutely zero attachment to this character he is neither sympathetic nor hateful just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery is he happy is he sad angry no idea just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh and the native american theme is just awful and pointless br br the good guys are at best unlikeable a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex wife stereotype cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you aren't going to shoot me that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying br br the richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated br br dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourke's or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves realistic female characters br br in summary a complete mess of a film hopeless characterisations and performances a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction and ultimately extremely dull its not even comedy bad either laughing at haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film
<START> how on earth can people give this movie a low rating unbelievable the performances of wilkinson and watson are so full of merit that i can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn if this sounds bad tempered it's because i just wiped my original 400 just now i was so impressed by tom wilkinson all hail the guy this is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill his development as an actor from the full monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing one of the best things to happen in film making in the last ten years br br emily watson is somewhat less commanding due to that glint in her eye that says 'see me this cheeky woman here you can't guess what i'm going to do next because i don't know either ' it seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role but still she's an actor of terrific ability and presence she is very sexy here as she needs to be and fair play to her for this this is a screen quality that normally for me she doesn't have in previous films br br as you might expect rupert everett required to play an upper class late 30 something who could give at phd level in how not to give a toss about heading to hell on account of total selfishness delivers he is so thin here throughout the movie however i'm worried for him linda housekeeper is also excellent a role but with a major plot twist to deliver she makes you ponder how much talent we have in britain in terms of character acting i want to see more of her br br the narrative arc is fine it's an interesting enough plot given that no one in film making seems to be trying to convince joe public that there's nothing new under the sun though it does stray towards 40s melodrama in the last ' but never mind that this is a terrific 80 minutes worth of anyone who has half a brain's money congrats to julian fellowes on his first directorial effort o how we need more films of substance like this he shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety and congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film actor's art from mr tom wilkinson what a geezer br br t
<START> you want a movie that'll take you places well this is a good pick if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film the of motown or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch at the risk of sounding cliche you'll laugh you'll cry you'll reminisce and remember you'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight you'll recall with fondness your best friends from school it's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism misconceptions losing friends deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film there are much worse ways you could spend your time
<START> one would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made for tv movie it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple wallis simpson and the prince of wales instead of being a mawkish unappetizing historical romance br br nor is it helped by the fact that jane seymour and anthony andrews give stiff rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention br br it's hard to understand why a star of olivia de havilland's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of aunt bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight at this stage in her career olivia was appearing in so many nobility roles requiring a regal presence but nothing more br br a trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made for tv movies of that era
