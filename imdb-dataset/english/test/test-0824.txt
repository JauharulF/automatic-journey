<START> while watching blackwater valley exorcism i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughter br br there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself if you dare br br the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort even the priest and i haven't even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelle's father the director must have just told him to act like he's got a stick up his because that's the general impression one gets br br i don't really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be had for all the wrong reasons but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary well run don't walk
<START> the plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind the violent clash between adolf hitler's germany and soviet russia from 1941 '45 br br with the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated and 20 to 30 million russian people killed the vibes of this conflict can be felt in russia up to the present day let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painful br br this very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of beautiful shots its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war bravery love patriotism weakness cowardice and corruption all beautifully tied together by a toy squirrel br br add to this the truly magnificent acting and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous really one of the very best ever made br br
<START> was released in 1987 by the now defunct american animation company filmation on the back of he man masters of the universe and she ra princess of power in 1983 and respectively the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall who possesses the strength of the bear ears of the wolf speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk and his trusty sidekick a talking horse named thirty thirty who carried with him a gun aptly titled jane' and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge j b serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlaws br br set in futuristic texas this was and still is to this day one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city in the us hence in the south thousands of light years ahead in the future considering this was made in the 80s the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a sci fi based outlook didn't just evoke morality and good verses bad as well as teaching children lessons about life but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldn't take things and life for granted and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon many of the story lines themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them in addition marshall was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ethnic minority background to make an impact on tv br br the sound effects were amazing the music was great the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons sadly br br whilst was overshadowed by the success of he man it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics suffice to say i preferred over he man because of the diversity of the story lines characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast for some reason they resonated more with people because like for instance in 'the where a kid dies from a drug overdose the fact that there wasn't a happy ending was important in the sense that when kids watch that episode well in fact anyone who watches that episode will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs br br bold brave and at times thought provoking is definitely that bold brave and thought provoking a cult cartoon classic for many years to come it dared to take some risks but it had well and truly paid off in the end it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever and rightly so br br 8 and a half out of ten
<START> first i must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book so of course i have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie but as i began to watch this film i was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt the original version from the early 1970s though shot at phillips exeter academy where the book's author attended school and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters the original seemed to simply go through the motions reading the trivia about the movie you discover that it was cast mostly with non actors thus the original has an amateurish feel to it and it ultimately fails br br this new version though i will grant that it captures the look of the period better than the original seems to have thrown the book out all together scenes are rearranged characters imposed where they don't belong characters created that were not in the book and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling and the cardinal sin of all the tree is not treated as the vital almost central character it is in the book this is an inexcusable oversight on the part of the film makers how could they downplay the role of the tree why was it not introduced immediately why the dead poet esque beginning and what in god's name was up with gene's accent this film is to be blunt garbage a separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or screen john knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine linear style the film makers should have trusted the story as it was already written make changes sure embellish here and there sure take some mild dramatic license sure but destroy one of the pearls of american literature in the process what were they thinking in their corruption of the story line they cut any possibility of suspense or drama the whole movie falls flat and fails miserably br br if you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking of skimping and just watching the movie don't even think about it this film will be of no help to you br br alas we shall have to wait even longer before a version of this story comes to the screen that truly does it justice
<START> i started watching this one very tensed because i heard so many different things about it somewhere i read it was a drama about child abuse and rated pg 13 for violence another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of kids and i thought it was also for kids to watch well now i've seen it so many times and still don't know in which category to put it it is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment because of the nice relationship and the adventures i would like to recommend this film to all the youngsters i know but i fear the somber atmosphere is not suitable for children because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film i must say this nevertheless watch it especially the kids the last thing i have to say is that i hate the scriptwriter for letting poor bobby never see his family again after having fled from the king who didn't even return to terrorize the remained mary and mikey it is very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everybody being happy and i didn't expect it to but this solution left me very very sad
<START> the satirical movie website dateline hollywood joked that son of the mask was all a practical joke star jamie kennedy played on new line cinema for his show the jamie kennedy experiment if only and if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece br br the mask was the ideal vehicle for the face pulling jim carrey that so many viewers dote on it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing cameron diaz so having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea plus you'd have thought new line would have learned their lesson after dumb and dumberer when harry met lloyd but no though to be fair having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic in which the mask went from owner to owner as written by lance and directed by lawrence however there's nothing there in return except a steady stream of admittedly decent fx by the usual squadron of houses industrial light and magic improving on the ally mcbeal dancing baby and their own baby's day out with the studio giant killer robots digital dimension and so on in support and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company responsible for such gems as siamese popes naming his character after tex avery and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips br br the trouble is that last approach doesn't really work partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat especially the cars getting in the party mood and mostly because the tributes to the flintstones woody woodpecker duck amuck and especially one evening show up how weak this movie is in comparison plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment the underlying theme of the story is family our hero isn't ready to have a son and his nemesis alan cumming as the norse god loki is far from the apple of odin's eye and what bob hoskins is doing here as odin even after super mario bros is beyond me and kennedy just isn't in the same league as carrey in the zany stakes though it's not like he gets any help from the script also note that unlike diaz the very cute howard as the mother of the son of the mask doesn't get much to do giving her the mask might have helped the movie br br further points are lost for throwing away cumming hoskins steven wright and magda szubanski for a suspiciously abbreviated running time which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the green guy as an animated tv series the mask did become an animated tv series in real life and was a far better follow up than this sequel the fact that this actually opened in britain before the us should tell you everything what with this and blade trinity new line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from two guys and a girl what next the butterfly effect 2 with nathan fillion br br somebody stop this
<START> the first film is somewhat good to me i enjoyed it for the most part but i thought it was really nothing all that special however when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get ruth gordon back to reprise her role the story kind of follows rosemary's baby around and stuff but in reality it is kind of a mess it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shines through very well it has more of a comedy tone to it as well which hinders it greatly if they really felt the need to make a sequel they should have made it an r rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it i am sure it would have still been quite bad but at least it would have been more watchable and fun which this movie is not despite its trying to be funny i saw this one on monstervision and joe bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and i do not have to much to say either i do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen the light of day
<START> may be spoilers no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre i've ever seen is an alien or just a crazy bugger this is the question you'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie br br kevin spacey is simply amazing as is jeff bridges you can't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times some of kevin actions in this movie are very funny when he was up in the tree for example and when he was talking to the queen mental patient the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared br br to simply put it right from the start you'll be hooked and if you really love drama's you won't be dissapointed br br a solid 85
<START> i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all br br in this case however i have to say it was bad i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second br br there was no proper storyline i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces br br the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third a 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together br br this movie was bad br br dominic
<START> eddy murphy and robert de niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy great often lead to dissapointment and this proves to be the case br br when eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by detective robert they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality tv cop show logic is not a great component of this movie the super gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it a twelve machine gun that leaves large holes in and three will destroy a house in about a minute without reloading is as more a fantasy than science fiction a five pound gun firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past br br it is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children so if you are somewhere in between this is the movie for you
<START> the authors know nothing about russians prisons the movie is absolutely cockamamie has nothing common with the reality they also don't that the foreign prisoners in russia have a special prison so the foreigners never live together with russian criminals the uniforms in this movie look if they were stolen somewhere in latin america prisoners in russia also don't work outside the prison each kill in russian prison is a subject of investigation so the prisoners kill each other only if there some very important reasons playing soccer is also forbidden in the prisons contacts between the prisoners are very restricted no chance for bloody combats etc etc etc so this movie has nothing common with the reality
<START> this plot had more holes in it than an oj simpson alibi br br i noticed two star trek references in the movie and yet br br ironically we have a lead character played by andy garcia br br who is the antithesis of the vulcan philosophy of the br br needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one br br let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of san francisco at incredible risk michael keaton's character is almost as br br unrealistic as well he neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when garcia foils his br br attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once the child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after been br br held hostage several times in a short expanse of time but br br put her on a wide 5 stories up and she loses it br br andy garcia's child is something of an anathema in this br br movie he is the most sympathetic and real character one of the movie's bright spots he furthermore utters a line that must have been the result of serendipity regarding fighting cancer that parallels keaton's motivation to escape all in all the movie was not a br br complete waste see from dusk to dawn 2 texas blood money br br for that but disappointing considering the talent on hand
<START> it helps that the characters this show is based on are among the best disney has ever come up with the writing is what really makes this show it's a total classic given you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it and this is hard to explain the humor is akin to the old school scenarios of 40's and 50's disney with modern spins it never degrades into fart jokes or anything of that type it's not adam sandler humor either though i have enjoyed that it is the exact same humor of the movie only expanded upon for the length of time a tv show permits so if you didn't like it in the movie you won't like it here but imo the new groove was the best thing to come out of disney since gargoyles br br a
<START> as much as i love ellen barkin who is really underrated i have to boo this movie if you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho sexual thriller or have never watched 20 20 it's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway br br overall this movie serves to turn on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex not a fun movie to sit through although if you like ellen barkin it's nice to see her place a tough lady
<START> i enjoyed the mr magoo cartoons i saw while growing up and i enjoy leslie comic skills so i thought this marriage must produce a funny child br br i couldn't have been more wrong br br this movie was just awful i don't recall a single funny moment this is one of the two or three times in hundreds of films over the years i've wanted my money back you will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way in a comedy the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags this plot does neither it just kinda lies there gasping like a beached fish
