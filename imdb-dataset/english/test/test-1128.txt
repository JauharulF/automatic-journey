<START> i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time i've always been intrigued by the title the star and the desert but for some now pretty clear reason this film is never shown on tv or i've happen to miss it if it's ever shown well after watching the dvd i now know why the movie is rarely shown it's because it's not that good in fact i'd say it's pretty much of a mess br br electra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together the movie can be boiled down to this intro murder cop and girlfriend together intro credits cops going to work crazy guy tells story cop finds dead body cop and chief and girlfriend at bar chase scene etc the scenes just don't flow together they're very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak borderline amateurish the scene at the bar with the girlfriend the scene at the farm with the hippies the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy i almost stopped the film during those awful moments br br the film maker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film the style like the 1970s is all over the map the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement then it tries to be a buddy film big john and zipper then a murder mystery then a melodramatic love story etc a film doesn't have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i'm afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it br br the film is not a complete disaster while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish the look of it is extremely and deceptively professional the cinematography is stunning every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery or because the first and last time director was involved in the music business worthy of an album cover the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves and thanks to robert blake's acting of a really badly written character the film maintains a certain level of realism even though nothing else makes much sense what's remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it's been copied and duplicated a million times over the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun which was made 13 years later scenes of johnny dressing up with his clothes on the bed reminded me of american gigolo strangely enough electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it due to the stunning visuals even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated br br so electra glide in blue is on one hand a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit but on the other hand is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters confusing story and muddled direction none of which are worth of remembering
<START> although inevitably linked to the 70's decade the concept of exploitation cinema is actually nearly as old as cinema itself moreover universal studios practically invented the term with their long running monster cycles dracula frankenstein the wolf man and the mummy every original classic spawned a couple of sequels at least and after a while they even thought up the idea of making genuine monster house of frankenstein released one year earlier and also directed by c was quite a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiast performances but house of dracula is a little too loony for me to recommend it the plot suffers too much from extremely irritating situations forced twists dialogs and Â most of all Â a far too short running time to elaborate the monsters' personalities like they deserve onslow stevens doesn't receive top billing but plays the most fundamental role as miracle a doctor who's challenged to cure count dracula carradine from his incontrollable thirst for blood and fix lawrence illness of mutating into a hairy wolf man whenever the moon is full during a nightly walk in some caves they also pick up the remainders of frankenstein's monster and the good doctor himself eventually undergoes a jekyll hyde metamorphosis due to a bad blood transfusion the last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback though not of the notre dame something is very wrong when you're watching a movie that is literally stuffed with horror icons yet the only character in the whole movie that is able to freak you out is an ordinary villager going by the name siegfried the actual monsters are dull and their once fabulous backgrounds are fully drained count dracula is a whining talbot is a pitiable and also whining old martyr and the frankenstein creation Â well his share in the plot isn't even worth mentioning there's a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this universal film especially compared to all their other efforts and the abrupt climax is a disaster
<START> square pigs as a way of efficiently utilizing cargo space is the one and only clever moment in space truckers believe it or not dennis hopper has done worse see the american way but this movie is way up there on the cream of the crap scale i think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that space truckers will please no one too cartoon like too be taken seriously an almost total lack of humor and poor character development virtually assures disappointment the beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing but all others have been warned to avoid space truckers for all of the above reasons merk
<START> i hardly know where to begin br br huge continuity issues bad acting etc for example sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head br br but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family is not even touched upon instead in the movie he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and when he gets tired of it he goes home where is his development where is the arc br br if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey double triple quadruple visions of the falcon and terrible production quality crackling ahem fire winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then restarting etc i guess it might be ok for an 8 year old br br but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment br br read the book instead
<START> i saw this hallmark television movie when it originally aired i lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch i just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film but hallmark stands for the best quality films now there is a reason to give this film a second look clive owen who plays damon just might have a chance to be selected as the next james bond 007 when pierce brosnan passes it on clive owen might have to wait until the year 2008 the other reason is the female lead is catherine zeta jones is now a celebrity she was an unknown at the time and became an academy award winner for outstanding supporting actress in 2003 joan plowright as mrs is also in this film i like the opening line in this film deliver my heart from this fearful lonely place send me a great love from somewhere or else i shall die truly i shall die
<START> big fat liar is a pretty funny movie but as i was watching it i thought about something some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable so really the film is kind of a big fat lie there is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this here are all of the unbelievable stuff br br 1 when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball and acts like he is the father jason frankie couldn't have gotten away with that well luckily for us he didn't so it didn't stick with it the outrageous br br 2 even if the grandmother was blind she still could've figured out that that wasn't her granddaughter br br 3 they couldn't have gotten on the plane flown to l a acted like they were coat salesmen sneak into the studio and then and then well some of the film is a little unbelievable but it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie trust me i do it all the time br br big fat liar though unbelievable at times is fun it's also very funny but let me just say one thing before i continue this review if paul giamatti wasn't in this movie it would really suck it would be horrible big fat liar is also pretty funny though corny at times i give it a thumbs up br br big fat liar
<START> this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time i'm in my late 40s and watched it with my son in law early 20s and son 17 the scenery was beautiful but the story was a bust we watched about an hour of it and turned it off i spent more time on my during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography otherwise i would have given it a 1 i'm sure there are people who are really into the art of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions right i couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a chick flick where the focus was on the mother or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys with the focus on battle and adventure in my opinion it didn't succeed in either
<START> mr wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the dragonball z tv series of course not br br this is a hong kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the japanese original cartoon which was also based on a comic book series and i really don't know if it was produced under the license of the dragonball creators br br however the story of the monkey boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over asia in japan the name of the boy in the tale is in china it is in korea it is etc and the story in dragonball has much to do with that tale br br by the way as i said this movie is based on the first episodes of the dragonball series which was followed by dragonball z although i think the us version had a different airing order and all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series without so much overacting and so much insistence on it but because of your comments i may suppose they were completely removed in the american dubbing br br anyway i agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is but maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it
<START> to say i was disappointed is an understatement an amateur film made by professionals i was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions something i've never done i was stopped by cloris leachman really she rings true the only one i should say this new women are less modern than the george cukor women of the 30's this ones are acting for us trying to be with it but their conflict is exactly the same as it has always been in movies anyway the fun of the original was based on a crisp vitriolic and very funny script a masterful direction and an cast all the elements that are missing here tv actresses with models and oscar nominees winners there wasn't anything organic about it the whole thing felt like a put on improvised in the moment without a clear objective 2 10
<START> in 1974 the teenager martha maggie grace moves to the high class area of belle haven greenwich connecticut on the mischief night eve of halloween she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved twenty two years later the writer mark christopher meloni who is a former la detective that has fallen in disgrace for perjury in o j simpson trial and moved to idaho decides to investigate the case with his partner stephen weeks andrew mitchell with the purpose of writing a book the locals squirm and do not welcome them but with the support of the retired detective steve carroll robert forster that was in charge of the investigation in the 70's they discover the criminal and a net of power and money to cover the murder br br murder in greenwich is a good tv movie with the true story of a murder of a fifteen years old girl that was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a kennedy the powerful and rich family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years however a snoopy detective and convicted in disgrace was able to disclose how the hideous crime was committed the screenplay shows the investigation of mark and the last days of martha in parallel but there is a lack of the emotion in the dramatization my vote is seven br br title brazil not available
<START> i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i q points for each passing second i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these
<START> i spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001 not only because of the psychological horror of which 2001 is a masterpiece but also because of the way it brought me a restless soul some clarity to the way i observe the universe it changed my way of thinking in a very profound way and after reading the novel by arthur c clarke i found myself once again inspired a writer as i am by the level of imagination br br the space odyssey is not something one can just go and see one has to be ready for it or it cannot be understood in fact i don't think it can be understood at all at least not all of it at once it is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring by richard strauss and 'blue danube' by strauss br br take all the time you want but eventually you are going to have to see this film if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me it can certainly do it for you as well br br or maybe i'm just plain crazy
<START> i really liked the movie thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic but i just had a question about the music is the movie i haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack if there even is one and specifically i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to new orleans i thought it was something along the lines of my great escape but i've searched on the internet books pretty much everything i could think of to try to and i just can't find it anywhere if someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated thanks
<START> this was a great movie it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy so what makes a movie great technical details i think that if that were the sole criteria our culture would be the poorer for it so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to mozart the point is it is one of the best movies of it's type i've seen the women are all beautiful as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made it has a little of everything a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets wayne's world there is plenty of charm and a reasonable albeit predictable storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen joe estevez may not have his brothers career but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in was that intentional if you're attracted to the box rent the video you won't regret it as is promised it is good non violent erotic fun
<START> these are the kinds of movies i loved and still love growing up unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them this movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy br br there was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't a list material but that is not the point the point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge cgi clichÃ©' filled movies there are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they can br br besides its also nice to know that good ol' bruce isn't dead yet
