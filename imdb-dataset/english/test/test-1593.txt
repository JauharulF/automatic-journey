<START> br br after the wit and liveliness of highway 61 and roadkill i expected this movie to shine but it was as bloated and self deluded as the hard rock stars it parodied the pace dragged not helped by an over long hallucination sequence the characters were flat and unmemorable and art is no jello i had to poke myself to stay awake
<START> i have read the other user comments and i am happy someone has compared it to the original by kamal called released in 2004 br br the original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the indian govt not having proper records or even bad shoots and bloopers br br the story is great and a touchy one and well described by others but sadly taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than plagiarism br br i guess he has been affected by so called inspired syndrome br br he must at least give credit where it is due br br i liked some of his older movies but now i suspect if any of them were originals after all br br here is a link in imdb for the original masterpiece http www imdb com title comment i recommend everyone to see the original even with subtitles if needed to know what class direction and class acting is all about
<START> i'm not really sure where to begin from start to finish bad stinky bad like stepping into a port a john on a 100 degree day if you force yourself to watch this as i did keep some vicodin handy for the pain i will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor the movie is a cross between gumby rides pokey meets the terminator meets wally beaver playing cowboys and indians without the cowboys i've seen better animation in the original cut of the blob you will get more entertainment from watching gone with the wind while suffering from the puke and poops bad acting and hokey lines will have you squirming and wishing you had rented peewee's big top or watched every episode of gilligan's island back to back ugh i'm going to go slit my wrist now
<START> for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family all of us hated it with a passion it's a nice enough kids' movie maybe in the year it came out however think about it an outdated kids' movie what's the point kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all br br some kids' movies like mary poppins or wizard of oz can be enjoyed even now but time bandits is totally outdated for your reference and i think applicable in this case i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all so if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies you might like time bandits br br there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the 'bad guys' think of the two stupid 'bad in the pirates of the c movies except in time bandits they are not even remotely funny br br anyway i warned you that's all i can do people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago if you have not seen it before then don't bother watching it now
<START> chuck jones's able kitty' is the cartoon that introduced pepe le pew to the sort of there are a few key differences between the pepe we know and love or hate in the case of some people and the character in this cartoon for one the disguised cat who pepe pursues in able kitty' is distinctly male also pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is henry at the cartoon's climax his french accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up pepe is not even the lead character here the focus the put upon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies for the most part the storyline largely follows the usual format of a pepe le pew cartoon but pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character he is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated in fact able kitty' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every pepe le pew cartoon that followed this subsequent development has robbed able kitty' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull pepe le pew short with a weird surprise ending as a child i hated pepe le pew as an adult able to appreciate his more sophisticated verbal and risquÃ© humour i love the character and most of his cartoons able kitty' makes me feel like a child again
<START> my wife and i endorse all the positive comments below made by other imdb members while this is no box office smash hit it has a special charm all of its own genuine and heart warming br br we saw this on video at the end of a long day we were very tired and in bed normally in a situation like this my wife drops off to sleep within minutes that is unless it is an exceptional movie and this one kept us both entertained right to the very end br br perhaps younger viewers in their teens and twenties would not like this but for the rest of us it is a true gem see it
<START> really this movie should be released to dvd i just got a bootleg copy of what i think was a studio film and i was utterly pleased it was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast three of my people michael york olivia hussey both having been in romeo juliet and also john sorry about the bad spelling were in there so on that alone i thought that for the small amount i was spending it would be fine boy was i right i'm not going to give any of this one away you may already know the story anyway but i'll just say if you can get yourself a copy in any format do it you won't be sorry
<START> i saw this piece of pseudo intellectual crap a couple of years ago and it is now making a comeback at the local film club it uses every clichÃ© in the intellectual movie makers handbook beginners edition in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be you get your run of the mill slow motion tempo brown color scale slow pans through bombed out environments blank suffering facial expressions over symbolic imagery and the requisite miserable ending br br it is a complete failure an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical russian art movie the director aleksandr sokurov has excellent command of technique but he lacks eye he doesn't see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic br br this movie is a wet dream for art film haters it lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre that there is br br if it was bad in an entertaining way it would a turkey but for a movie that is so bad that you walk out afterwards royally p ed off we need a new term this movie is a sokurov
<START> highlighting the acting of sidney poitier and the brooding on screen presence of john cassevetes the edge of the city is a highly watchable film from the fifties directed by martin ritt there is great acting and stunning on location photography in black and white br br poitier is a delight at this point in his career and tommy tyler the character he plays is happy and outgoing he befriends axel played by cassevetes who is a young man suffering from poor self esteem and a past that he wants kept under wraps tyler a black man brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girlfriend br br tyler and are employed on the new york docks at a time when the workers were expected to tow the line if they knew what was good for them the boss charles malik played by jack warden in one of his many hard bitten roles becomes the focus of discontent which leads to a climactic showdown with br br at the end of the movie we are left with mixed emotions however the two main characters have left the audience with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world
<START> i thought this movie was amazing i was a bit skeptical since i really had no idea what it was about but it was beautiful story i cried a lot and i also laughed out loud br br i think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the holocaust and how it affects people it only happened 60 years ago i have been to germany and eastern europe and i have studied the holocaust so this film meant a lot to me i think this film did an amazing job capturing this story i wont go into detail i do not want to spoil it but i definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that i know this may sound clichÃ©' but will change your mindset on things
<START> driving lessons from the writer of the critically acclaimed films mrs brown and charlotte gray jeremy brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring academy award nominees julie walters and laura linney and from the harry potter series rupert the beautiful portrait tells the story of ben marshall rupert a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother laura laura linney after his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever free spirited and heavy on the bottle retired actress walton julie walters the pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life challenging the domineering mother as well as each other along the way the two develop a beautiful bond that both their lives br br the comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the british veteran julie walters brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream directing comes naturally to brock as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation even the subtle score by unknown composers clive carroll and john accentuate the tone and manner brock had no trouble in generating br br laura linney is always making her mark in films as she does as laura the bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona the complexity of her character couldn't have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else rupert breaks away from ron and tries on someone new his performance is more responsive than loquacious but gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it but the standout is coming from oscar nominated actress julie walters who gives a life of her own despite the role being clearly a leading one walters fairs better in the supporting category where i believe she can simply take home the prize is a mix of clementine and mrs laura henderson with her free spirit and lovable persona hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards season br br driving lessons isn't an out of this world experience but a fine enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life love and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizes br br grade
<START> water shows the plight of indian widows in the late 1930s says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics in the end refers to gandhi several times in the movie before finally having a scene depicting him and does nothing extra ordinarily innovative or new in the movie yes the cinematography is pretty impressive but that cannot be the soul of any movie for me br br india has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid of many of these problems at large what if a movie is made on racism in america in a particular year which ends with 'x number of americans still experience racism today' br br a how would it be relevant and b how would it be some thing so extra ordinary being depicted in cinema br br a view i read from a deepa mehta interview was that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalised every where from reviews i read every where the common thing i am hearing is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world the movie is more about a specific problem a society faced and has got rid of through reforms at large br br i do not see any thing earth shattering about the movie moreover the movie lacked soul and shifted between the plots of and the young sri lankan actress portrayed the role of superbly and that was the only thing which impressed me about the movie sadly
<START> man i can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie okay it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art but it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun for starters the titular pumpkin headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera he looks like something you would see in a fourth rate carnival spookhouse secondly the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster then there's the always welcome presence of the ever lovely linnea quigley who's memorably introduced taking a nice long utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes amazingly we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends john carradine as an evil warlock and cameron mitchell as a horror tv show host moreover scream queens brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith have fleeting cameos lead child actor ryan projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump pretty brunette rachel carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts the cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special the score is suitably overwrought yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch
<START> one of the worst movies ever made let's start with the superficial joaquin phoenix is first of all too fat to be a rookie fireman the nyfd does not recruit pillsbury dough boys john travolta has a bad dye job and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended scientology bender the plot hits on all the tropes and clichÃ©s of what the average joe believes life as a firefighter is really like they all get drunk get into fights have a hard time expressing their emotions their wives all stay at home crying they all have father issues everyone has a boston accent et cetera an execrable piece of that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9 11 which was by the way valid cultural hero worship this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship
