<START> jean pierre melville is a director i've only recently gotten acquainted with i need to see bob le and le samourai again to fully grasp them but in watching le rouge the red circle supposedly based on a saying in buddhism i realized i was watching as skillful and absorbing a crime film as i had seen in a quite some time though his film has dialog it is mainly to keep the film's scenes rolling along adherent to the plot what kept me on the alert even in seemingly mundane scenes sequences was the emphasis on the characters' movements or behavior patterns melville has his story laid out and he is careful to take his time to tell it this could seem boring to some but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters environments over plot br br yet look at each of the four main players alain deleon as corey just released from prison scheming a new heist gian maria as vogel escaping on the lam from hand cuffed custody meets corey by luck yves montand as jansen an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons a friend of vogel and andre as mattei an experienced investigator who is on the look out for vogel and on his toes with internal affairs each of these actors plays their parts with precision detachment and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops the heist sequence gives little hints for example like how vogel cops a feel off a female statue while passing down the halls or how jansen takes out a flask and merely has a whiff of the contents and what a dream this guy creates even corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest br br as absorbing and cool the story becomes and as great the skills were to make it happen via cinematographer henri the editing and the musical score by eric it's the people on the screen that gain fascination in how they stay true to their natures and ideals not a film to be missed by french new wave enthusiasts and modern day crime movie buffs might want to take the 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of melville's work a suave piece of film making that still ranks as one of my all time favorites
<START> i saw this series on pbs in 1980 in college and i still can't get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots
<START> let me start off by saying i love japanese cinema literature and culture generally i've seen many japanese movies and enjoyed them but portrait of hell aka makes itself ridiculous the two characters who dominate the action the evil lord in his privileged bubble and the stubborn crazy artist are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance and all their actions from cartoonish extremes the film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotion but many of these scenes are so over the top they actually become laughable and the overall feeling is that of a made for tv movie that went off the rails if this rarely screened movie falls in your hands or comes to your town spare yourself and give it a pass
<START> if you want to see a true thriller rent this it's not from the director or screenwriter of scream doesn't feature overacting overpaid tv actors passing off as stars and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza instead you'll get a top notch edgy very strong in violence yet thrilling
<START> first of all i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen i have watched it almost 10 times just because i've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims it has the captivating essence of a hand held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday it has all the writing of a wwe match and most of all it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk this movie is a masterpiece br br the film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken teens in the desert this scene convinced me that i was onto something big when i picked this film from the dvd rack being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word raptor on the front of it the scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce spaghetti intestines vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie this movie is a masterpiece br br the film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes one's mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film an example is when a truck in the middle of the night is parked beside a cliff wall the very next day they find it in an open area the driver couldn't have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed i will explain why it's unnamed in a second so my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it the livestock the driver was transporting did it or jim wynorski doesn't think very highly of his viewers hell in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesn't have gutters the fire is precariously placed next to a phone booth and there's only a single street light yet still i feel compelled to watch and re watch this film just so i can find more things that will make me giggle the next time i watch it this film is a masterpiece br br the directing on this film is horrific long extended pauses strange cuts to characters that weren't even in the general vicinity of the conversation people discussing things casually while facing the camera and in turn making them face the wall they can't even give the dinosaur a coherent species flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet distinguished by the intensely long fat disproportionate claw this film is a masterpiece br br the editing is prominent on this film this is not a good thing i am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap but there has to be a limit sub plots end as abruptly as they began explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to well not being explained at all and an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt you just never know what is going to happen because the film doesn't follow a coherent structure this film is a masterpiece br br now i'm going to just have to mention a single scene the greatest one that occurs near the end this is a spoiler but not really the final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and sheriff tanner it is like the showdown between sigourney weaver and the alien queen in aliens except without all the emotional power budget epic battling it pretty consists of tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery a white bobcat in a space of several minutes through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forklift crane looking piece of machinery now as i said i know that this film is made from scenes from other films but what two films warrant a showdown with a t rex in a construction vehicle this film is a masterpiece br br this film gets a 1 10 for quality of film making but a 10 10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself
<START> anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called congo understands my title and i feel for you this movie wasn't just bad it was painful the book was stupid the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible dylan walsh rumor has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad huge diamonds killer gorillas talking gorillas hmmm sounds like a hit oh tim accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf i recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or patients who just need that one more reason to die if this is faithful to the book i would say lets have us a good old fashion footloose book burning and destroy every copy if future generations look back and find this garbage how would we explain ourselves listen to the others who hated this movie don't watch it run away do not watch this movie if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects you are wrong if you think it blows more cock than nicole ritchie you'd be right so if you still are going to watch crapo i mean congo i say do it after you just took 50 tylenol pm
<START> the director loves the actress and it shows the actress inhabits the character whom we love at first sight and sound the character loves her jealous husband and he loves her his childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes the love tragic and ironic his wife is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks her attentions are out of secret love for her husband br br then there is a murder and the investigating police lieutenant who loves only his bi racial son and resents being taken from his company by the above characters who have had some unpleasant contact with the deceased and are all lying to one degree or another unravels the mystery with some of the most precise and authentic procedural detail ever captured on film br br and then there are the atmospherics of a post war paris where coal is in short supply music is filled with erotic longing and wistful memory and innocence has long ago been washed away by the rain br br all of this in a milieu of magicians whose tricks don't always work dogs who walk on their hind feet and express music criticism hungry news reporters and exhausted cops br br and then there are many of the finest actors of their generation who have been through some very bad years directed by to come full circle a man who is in love with his lead actress and who with full justification was a respected friend of picasso br br i've seen this film often and i love all of them and it
<START> northfork is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography for this alone the film is well worth one's time the stark wide open plains and badlands of eastern montana are captured in the spare muted earth tones of autumn or early spring the gigantic grey cement fort peck dam is the film's protagonist the film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of western landscape the dialogue can be trying at times yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film the 1950's period works so well here and is executed so well i think that the passing years will be kind to this film
<START> thirty years prior to the deer hunter came this movie an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the american family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives a truly ironic title the best years of our lives is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved br br truly an ensemble cast despite the top billing of myrna loy the best years of our lives focuses more on the stories of the men al stephenson march comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife milly myrna loy fred derry upon returning cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to marie a happy go lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him homer parrish on the other hand has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world including the girl he loves and her family thinks he is a freak of nature br br at almost three hours of length the film never seems long and drawn out there is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing not a performance rings false though the standouts are those of dana andrews as fred derry harold russell as homer parrish and virginia mayo as marie derry even then every character has his or her moment on film and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in american films including the ones made around world war one which did not dabble in such topics while there is never any overt violence it's all there in the haunted expressions of the three male leads' faces in the lot where the planes now reside ready to be turned into junk and therefore in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shell shocked men who had seen battle or even worse to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for this is the film in which coming home and born on the fourth of july are indebted to at a time when america fled from war films to come up with this when the end of the second world war was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film making
<START> rented the video with a lot of expectations but it was a disappointment the story didn't make sense the plot was very weak and the special effects well i think even i can do better with my home computer sorry missed a change here
<START> i had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently i had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my return flight as well obviously attempt to get some arty cred the movie is a shambles because of her lousy acting ability a better actress might have made this work but a simple look at the face of moore shows the emptiness within at least she's not ruining american literature this time out
<START> when i saw the preview for this movie i figured to myself here's another dumb tv movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera but when i saw it i was surprised tiffany amber thiessen stars and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man now and eric close but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community at first she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of him br br while this sounds like the set up for another boring melodramatic tv movie it is really much better than that because the characters are well acted by thiessen and close and the movie's script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you'd expect these aren't just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to move the plot along but real three dimensional people and we find ourselves really caring about them and the movie is smart enough that it is able to provide an exciting involving climax to the story without resorting to dumb action scenes mindless cliches or cheap melodrama instead we share in the main character's inner conflicts and fears and are given a realistic portrayal of how she might be able to resolve them and do the right thing br br if you get a chance to give this one a look please do so it's production values are not exactly top notch it is a tv movie after all but if you can look past that there is an excellent story to enjoy
<START> this film is more than the story of it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system it probably helped spur the solidarity union activity it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution solidarity began the end of the system this film itself is historical by it's very existence the rest is history br br aka totalitarian leaders aka when one watches this film one must remember the snowball which began in poland br br actually it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left
<START> i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script susan sarandon plays the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together she removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in hollywood the daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice the bond with mother is pathologically strong br br in time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground she sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves 'em and leaves 'em she sees that the mother doesn't get it so how can she look to her mother for guidance br br the mother directs the girl to a drama try out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly by night mother this causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic but the lesson takes hold br br there is character growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go it is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents however emotionally dependent have to let the child go and become her own separate person
<START> fate leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end br br the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful br br joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film that's titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished br br the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating 3 10
