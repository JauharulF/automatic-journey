<START> ok i went to this website before i watched this movie read the comments got pumped cause they where all pretty good for a b flick watched it and was completely disappointed the main characters wannabe lone rebel straight out of the mid west act was sickening to the stomach and don't even get me started on the two cops i mean there's a bloody door right there in plain view check it out the plot was completely predictable the editing was rather limited i swear the editor was even dozing off near the end when he was cutting this movie and the direction was clouded by bad cinematography now please don't get me wrong i love b flicks some are really good br br want to watch a good b rated flick br br dave recommends br br high tension br br http imdb com title
<START> i'm from australia and have watched with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding rugby union in new zealand i can totally appreciate the comments made by in relation to this movie it was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport br br whoever was involved in the making of this atrocious movie should be made to formally apologize to anyone who had the misfortune of watching it note people do not kneel down and cry while slowly reciting the what a pitiful scene this was br br are we supposed to feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who nearly killed his girlfriend who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain then apparently saw the light what a thoroughly dislikable character with the visits to children's hospitals doing nothing to redeem his despicable personality br br and why are people even making a movie about americans playing rugby they barely even feature in the sport on the world stage not so much as to even warrant an attempt at making a movie about it yes a 'world' sport unlike gridiron and baseball
<START> all right it was in black and white and probably on 2 tape which means the bbc wiped it right but it stays in my mind from all those years ago 1960 as a perfect slice of history enlivened by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado br br i want to see it again are you reading this bbc find your original 2 tapes or the 35mm film deal with the actors and directors for the rights and re issue i know i know some of them are dead some of them are missing in action br br where else will i be able to see mary morris as the heart wrapped in a tiger's where else will i be able to see paul do 'now is the winter of discontent ' or robert hardy deliver his speech about 'that idol
<START> sherlock holmes films from the classic universal era tend to range in quality this range goes from very good to above average with none of their output being abysmal or astoundingly brilliant sherlock holmes and the secret weapon fits snugly into the middle ground quality wise and as ever it's an enjoyable outing that fans of the series like myself will enjoy very much this film sees holmes in the middle of a world war 2 plot by the evil nazi's to steal a swiss scientist's invention which could turn out to be a key element on the battlefield the world war 2 sherlock holmes films don't tend to be as good as the ones such as the scarlet claw where holmes is conducting private investigations as they're usually dogged by too much propaganda or a plot that is more to do with the war than the mystery this one however pretty much stays away from both and by putting the focus on holmes and his investigation the film works much better perhaps universal saw what brought down the earlier voice of terror and changed the focus because of that br br basil rathbone once again puts in an excellent maverick performance as the ace detective and while nigel bruce doesn't feature as much as normal it's nice to see him when he does the two don't spent much time together which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about holmes films but this does allow more time for holmes to showboat in various disguises which is always lots of fun dennis lestrade is definitely my favourite of the secondary characters and while he's not as funny as usual his facial expressions are great and his presence helps to emphasise how great holmes is his scene with watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film it's good to see holmes' nemesis professor moriarty return even if it does seem like he's just been thrown in for the hell of it lionel atwill's performance isn't as good as george in the adventures of sherlock holmes as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind but seeing him lock horns with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the film to offset the world war 2 themes which are never as interesting as holmes himself the film starts off as more of a thriller than a mystery flick but once it gets going it's hard to put down and this is a more than solid entry in universal's oeuvre
<START> a lovely librarian played by playboy model kristine debell falls asleep and dreams herself into a strange world filled with extremely uninhibited these people love to sing and dance and fool aroundÂ alice has a series of sensual adventures among these br br the film was originally shot as a poem to eroticism with few explicit sex scenes which were eventually cut from its theatrical videocassette versions however have had some of the original erotic encounters joined at the end with themÂ br br for an extremely low budget picture the producers of this film did an extremely good the cinematography is full of life and energy the dances and numbers quite professional and the acting without a doubt it is one of the best adult fairy tales aroundÂ
<START> this may be one of the best movies i have ever seen it has anything but a trite plot and leaves one wondering which way it will go next it is an interesting portrayal of the struggles of youth youth who are interested in more than immediate gratification youth who show some concern about the desires and needs of others
<START> sorry for all you guys that are not family with the lynches br br my sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie i told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces br br after every movie i tell myself again one and a half hour lost of my life but next time i will check the director's or producers name br br so you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time don't watch it but if you think that you need to kill someone watch it this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane
<START> i stumbled across this movie late at night on tv my brother and i could not stop laughing at how god awful this movie is the crappy sound effects whenever white ninja or black ninja punch kick or use a weapon is hilarious this movie is almost on the same level as the evil dead series but you can only watch this movie once because of shear crappiness i'm not sure if the director meant for it to be so crappy on purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it
<START> an incomprehensible script when it shouldn't have been dependent on a rather flaky voice over br br the animation however show real talent br br quite visually impressive
<START> george zucco was a fine actor often playing eyed villains with a lascivious intensity however even he couldn't save this dull and flat footed b flick br br zucco plays the usual mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron who believes that wolf's blood injected into humans can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win the world war ii go figure experimenting on pedro the handyman glenn strange zucco creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones dave allen used to play in his comedy sketches pedro is obviously based on lennie from of mice and men and you almost keep expecting him to say duh okay george there's one startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching in through the window and grabbing it but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian very pedestrian 77 minute tread through all the old clichÃ©s that are done far better in other movies we also get the revenge motif from the devil bat worked in in itself a borrowing from son of frankenstein br br zucco is wasted and you only have to see him in films such as adventures of sherlock holmes the mummy's hand and dr secret to see how wasted a few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer really and the scene where zucco demonstrates his wolf man technique to those who doubted him again shades of dr jekyll and mr hyde is unintentionally hilarious br br not one of the better 40s b movies
<START> stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character yardley is the modern equivalent of dickens' scrooge in the way he control over his employees until the christmas spirit overtakes him the role is a in the park' for greenstreet who had been one of the great when he was part of the company greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when at age 61 he was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film john huston ever directed 'the maltese falcon' was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle european the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem
<START> it seems on the surface to be a romantic planes trains and automobiles but at times tried for something more where it failed miserably some may like the ending but the attempts at deep insight into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere br br but if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you the unnecessary special effects of which the falling rain was the most obvious served to do nothing but annoy the camera work is erratic at best br br one note of caution however my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying sitting in the first row with a group of around
<START> first of all even imdb is with this movie as the list of cast is very even main characters are missing from it like buddy for example br br now back to the movie i love watching movies but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes it was horrid probably the worst movie i have ever seen and the reason why it bothers me so much is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehand br br the plot line itself is good it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting golden brooks was a huge disappointment i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud fun loving energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends melodramatic roles are not for her at all she basically killed her character rachel br br i love some of the cast like deborah cox mel jackson and darrin dewitt henson but even they couldn't save this catastrophic movie of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill harper as a man and he didn't help me get to like him more here either br br golden brooks' voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie it seemed like she whispered throughout the whole joint the director i won't even waste board space on he did such a bad job the editing photography camera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad not to mention the dialogs absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself br br as i said it could have been a very nice movie but it was seriously messed up i would not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematography major and want to see a 'what not to do' example for their future work br br have a great day everyone
<START> i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom's sign in she will write her own review later br br this is my all time favorite movie it was filmed in england in 1944 i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape i love this movie and it changed my life the beautiful landscapes the mighty pie bold thoroughbred horse the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done compete in the grand national in london with her most beloved horse the pirate it all made me want to ride horses which i have done now for 7 years and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them it's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds overcoming your fears believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working very hard also the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races i never get tired of watching this movie everything about it is perfect especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses
<START> my first post at the imdb has to unfortunately be to warn others not to waste their time with the cavern there is no story no character development no scares and no good lighting it doesn't make any sense if you enjoy bad acting people running through small portions of caves bouncing cameras posed at bad angles and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness you'll love this movie i could shut the lights off in my house and scream too and i wouldn't have to pay for the rental the only thing that scared me was that someone actually made a movie this awful br br one of the worst movies i've ever rented
