<START> from the start you will like sam elliott's character falon a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to his partner but too loyal and too when seeing his partner dead in an alley cause he then kills who he thought to be the assailant before giving him a chance to explain falon is an alcoholic and that tends to sway him from being in self control though he manages to direct his attention towards finding who's really behind his partners death he carries along a rookie as his new partner which seems to be seen too often in films but esai morales does well in accompanying sam elliot though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where morales begins a self approved investigation towards falon he mainly wants to find the answers since fallon isn't letting him in on the whole story and does not like what he finds there is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are which is okay and they are not able to sway falon into joining them leading to a dramatic ending fine acting all the way around with a touch of humor from paul sorvino who is the captain of detectives it's a good movie that will make you want to see it several times so it qualifies as a must see and a good addition to a movie collection filmed in san francisco
<START> i saw this last night on turner classic movies tcm i had never heard of it before and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing br br bogart does a star turn as a city wise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy radio network boss in this incisive b programmer about 12 years before he played similar city wise cynics to perfection in movies like deadline usa knock on any door the barefoot contessa and the harder they fall bogie already had the star qualities down pat br br in order to boost ratings and bring their somewhat high brow programming to a more popular level the voice of america pushes a tell all radio mini series about a woman who was acquitted 20 years ago by a plea of self defense of killing her husband not willing to be discreet in order to save the woman's and her husband's reputations the station uses underhanded methods to reveal all to all listeners and as luridly as possible br br as a time capsule i also found it very illuminating of male female mores in the workplace in the mid 1930's although beyond henry o'neill i'm unfamiliar with the supporting cast the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was taut br br if you like this kind of movie at all e g a face in the crowd an inspector calls etc don't miss the opportunity to see this one br br
<START> who said it had to be believable do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film you'll enjoy the experience much more you'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set ups and simply accepting it for what it is a great family film i appreciated not having to be concerned about questionable elements in a children's film for once that to me is worth the price of the ticket and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it older will enjoy this film enough good humor to keep adults interested very good film
<START> imagery controls this film the characters although interesting ultimately take a back seat the first scene i remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean that then opens to full screen and color the bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface the theme of the movie here being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living br br water as an ultimate consciousness as a tool of god is used to here to force people to get their houses in order judgment day the dead have to be accounted for and lifted to a better place whatever one has left unresolved or unsettled will be washed away there's no clinging on to the past to a buried memory of what was br br this movie has been compared to o brother where art thou and the threat of water and its use as a cleansing force is similar to that film what's different in this movie is that the coming of the water is knowable and so again the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now br br i agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a david lynch work take for example the dinner segment with the deep voiced and androgynous waitress one gets the same surreal feel from the setting and odd character as one does with the backwards talker in the scene from fire starter the difference is that lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a troubled character whereas this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message the men in black suits can't have anything they want they must be patient and accept what is available
<START> i have become a big fan of the work of barbet schroeder so maybe i am already a little biased by now but i think this movie is great although there may be a few lengths it is a romantic unromantic view of the great liberation in the later sixties stylistically amazingly polished great set design and in my opinion still very watchable br br basically this is an ironic re telling of the story of adam and eve who are driven from paradise after having tasted the fruit which has turned from an apple into a hypodermic filled with heroine the woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom i say accelerating as the guy seems to be doomed and bound for an intensive life and an early grave right from the great title sequence onwards there is no place for any hope br br although the story is rather sad i was captured by the beauty both of the beautiful location ibiza and farmer i found her character was at once shallow enigmatic endearing annoying interesting and boring somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic way architecture and built artifacts in general are put to very good use Â which seems to be a schroeder trademark of sorts br br there is even some humor mainly delivered by stefan the german main character and his accent his main nemesis is not a snake but an older german of dubious reputation Â and provider of the heroine called wolf although it is a german name and stefan is german he pronounces it english and in fits of jealousy spits the name out at his girlfriend in regular intervals Â becoming a boy who cries at times stefan has to work in order to earn a at one time the guy goes and afterward awkwardly clambers up a rock with his rubber flippers Â never has male frontal nudity been funnier in movie history
<START> i recently rented twister a movie i'd seen several years ago on tv and it has aged well i found myself laughing out loud several times at it and as weird as all these people are by the end i profoundly cared about them this is the sort of little movie that is made for a cult audience because rather like well i think that's what it is it's an acquired taste you have to be attuned to its peculiar wavelength the production values might be charitably called inexpensive and the pace and atmosphere take a while to get settled but the film has a look especially in some wonderful shots contrasting the dry flatness of the land with the opulence of the mansion interior michael almereyda had a good eye even then life with magnate eugene cleveland harry dean stanton and his household two adult children a grandchild and a housekeeper seems so detached from life outside we could be in everyone in this film is wonderful especially suzy amis and crispin glover as the directionless genius siblings maureen and howdy inhabiting their roles so comfortably after a while you just buy the strange premise that somehow having survived the tornado and being apparently incapable of happiness these people are lucky and yet don't know quite what to do with their luck there are some truly great scenes eugene's sudden confrontations first with his gold digging children's tv host girlfriend virginia an pert lois chiles then with his children william s burroughs taking target practice in the barn and telling a story about a mysterious jim maureen's boyfriend chris proving himself by battling a shed full of wasps cloaked in a tablecloth and and old fedora howdy violet maureen and chris all sitting on the couch the latter three in appropriately lightweight summer garments the former in a red blazer and black leather rock'n'roll gear staring at images of deserts on the huge tv and contemplating the future the images were done by bill viola who did the backdrop video installation for nine inch last tour crispin glover is predictably magnificent as howdy as always he remains perfectly in character howdy has made a cult of his misery and brilliance he's like the oscar wilde of kansas striving to live up to his red velvet suit whether he's thrashing away yet loudly on an electric guitar cracking a bullwhip while wearing an all black cowboy outfit demolishing a room or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the aforementioned soup from a blender pitcher he's mesmerizing if you like his work you'll like this
<START> this is the story of a maniac cop who for some reason has it in for a young college stud and his mates after they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when on a bet the kids hack into a department store's security and unlock the door only they get locked in the store along with the weirdo murder and mayhem are afoot and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape br br game' would have been a successful cat and mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location the thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work especially when he comes face to face with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet does nothing serious quite often there was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story and may've worked better if say for example the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid although granted even that is clichÃ©d br br what a shame too that it could not have been a better thriller considering a funky cast of young australian characters even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture instead it started out fresh and sure did have plenty of action sequences but wound up verging on the ridiculous
<START> a while back i bought the chinese box set of fist of the north star which came with all of fist of the north star fist of the north star 2 new fist of the north star and the fist of the north star movie while there is an american version and a few european versions they end half way through fist of the north star which is about as far as the movie goes br br the series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called shin ken fist of the north star named or ken for short there is only one successor each generation it takes place in a post apocalyptic future where martial arts is the most powerful weapon the two most powerful arts are shin ken and divine ken as my version calls it is really multiple styles but they are all the same since they allow a person to chop someone to pieces there are six masters and each has their own star is an art that allows someone to damage kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body each art has their own constellation big dipper goes around saving the world from evil consisting of going after his two brothers and three of the masters and their armies each army captain has their own way of fighting which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody also is looking for his girlfriend who was stolen by the master shin along the journey is joined by his brother after rescuing him from his brother rao who calls himself or boxing king he is also joined by two masters rei who is looking for his sister who was taken by ken's brother and shu both of them and die along the way other characters that join ken are two kids rin and who don't do much that's about as much as i can say for story since its so long and full of details the series is also divided into four parts br br what makes this show great is the fighting ken normally goes up against a group of people that think they are tough and then get killed in one hit which is funny and badass but makes for quick fights another great part is comedy ken hits someone and they think its nothing ken says they are already dead then they die other parts are when he'll hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live then a counter will pop up or when he tells them they are not worthy of knowing his name then there is when he does a rapid fire kick or punch and goes wa da da da da da da etc eventually you might find yourself doing it with him one great part was when a bad guy thought he knew he went up to ken and hit him ken stood there said he was dead in a few seconds the bad guy counted off then died it isn't limited to ken everyone else kills just as quick there has never been a character as awesome as ken and their probably never will br br there are a few problems though one is the repetitive nature some flashbacks mainly the one with being taken are played too much and there are also too many recap episodes especially in part four of the series in fact the last episode is a recap of the whole thing another problem is the ending the final battle with rao wasn't that impressive ken and rao fought then talked etc until rao came to some realization and kills himself instead of ken killing him but it is better than the american and european versions that just cut off halfway br br who would i recommend this for this is for older teenagers and adults who like action since the styles cause people to explode or get cut into pieces the violence is very graphic and there is a lot of it but they don't show much blood because they usually make the death just a silhouette that still looks like the person but less colorful this was probably done to avoid censorship if you don't like action rent the american version if you like action though then i say go for the import since you can see all of the series but they do not have the best english translation since it is subtitled by the chinese note my import came with everything i said at the beginning some imported versions do not but you still have to get an import to see all of the series and fist of the north star 2 if you don't think you can handle the subtitles for any reason then go get the american version another note in the version i got no subtitles were on the last disc for new fist of the north star although new fist of the north star isn't very good to begin with br br i give the show an 8 10 for its high amount of action good story and the awesomeness of br br update br br animation released an english subtitled version you can download the episodes as well as no ken 2 from or watch it free on site
<START> what some mistake for stilted dialog and or dismiss as archetypal characterizations accurately represents how people talked lived and were before world war ii let alone in whatever years the big trail represent on film br br the movie took my breath away the first time i saw it years ago reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed at the box office and why movie goers got the benefit of wayne in b westerns for another ten years wayne was in my opinion better in the big trail and the years of bs than most of his star turns after 1939 with ford's incredible cavalry trilogy true grit and the shootist being big time exceptions br br what a shame theaters missed the boat on this in 1930 had this movie hit we might have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum in my opinion this is not only one of the finest westerns ever filmed with accurate dialog and accurate character realization but among the finest representations of a passage of any kind ever put on film br br it still takes my breath away especially the dialog and accurate characterizations of types that simply don't exist any more some celebrate the surface of our culture that in fact hides the largest cultural degradation into 'people like us' and 'people like them' and political divide vs main in us history but for me the big trail represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious but underneath them most folks wanted to work out the nation's failures and most folks aspired to build a great culture and a great nation br br the big trail is an epic of the melting pot in motion toward the american dream certainly the finest film on that path i ever saw that subject ever filmed
<START> my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store from the cover it looked like a science fiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st james was in the film realized it was a christian movie and suggested we watch it we are conservative but we also know that christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream nevertheless we decided to give it a screening br br to be fair there were a few things i liked about the film the musical score much of which was orchestrated was quite good the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower budget movie br br unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script the film begins with an interesting premise ufo abductions but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture at least the frank peretti inspired the which was itself a deeply flawed film had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdown br br as for the acting the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful rebecca st james plays a bit part and is passable for their part a few of the main characters are manned capably enough sadly their talents are wasted on characters so one dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable the protagonists are anything but you know it's bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying br br a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie which will be of more interest to christian than non christian readers in a word it is embarrassing other christian films like the champion and peretti's the hangman's curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive this film by contrast is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy handed and lacking in tact that a non christian would have a hard time taking it seriously br br i do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place and i applaud efforts to create good christian film unfortunately this is not one of them if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film consider mercy streets the aforementioned the champion or if you're pentecostal robert duvall's provocative the apostle br br as for unidentified rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a non christian or a larger audience
<START> i expected fame to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite the overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential however fame builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over i was very surprised when the graduation scene pops up we thought the dvd had skipped or something all of the characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends you might think there are too many characters but its probably too many scenes its evident the film was cut up and shortened because its sometimes lacks transition i think laura dean as lisa monroe is my favorite character i really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart boyd gaines as michael the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer is also very good i didn't especially like irene cara's character of coco but this is not cara's fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs warrants watching the whole film in summary the film could use many improvements but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history
<START> even if ryan wasn't such of an annoying person this would still be bad i said even if where do we begin directors log you will have the urge to snatch his tape recorder and pound it with a hammer or punt it into a lake a haunted lake of course oh how i wish dead time was more literal as opposed to what they refer to it as but alas no death maybe a pillow out of place or a humming noise oh wait thats the cat i actually expected to see some sort of evidence or at least something to verify their escapades don't worry you wont see anything you that you would not see on a normal day br br an entire season and what do they have to show for it um nothing no in fact they have less than nothing they have a waste of time they took my challenge the do something for the paranormal challenge now in this you actually do something for the paranormal you could say go on camera and say i love the paranormal so much i'll draw stick figures of ghosts or i love the paranormal so much i'll film hot co eds pretending to be ghost hunters you would be wasting film but wasting it for the paranormal or you could say i'll mess with a demon but don't say it's name you might get hurt and you know god doesn't like that that would be quite a thing for god but he wouldn't like that so don't do that so i asked them to waste time for the paranormal and they followed suit they went into an old building looking for it was a waste of time it made no real difference at all it had no effect we learned nothing new it was a waste of time and film br br there amazing detective work is just so uncanny well we found your problem a cat died here so were going to psychically communicate with that cat and tell it to move on kind of throw some at it and it'll be ok directors log captain log star date 2 oh i mean directors log i just brought on a few new investigators a couple 8's and 9's but this chic is a 10 um yeah we have a new case strange things happening focusing on one of the children were going to investigate now we will bring is a psychic we haven't told them anything this is tv trust us
<START> victor who is the grandfather of swedish cinema directed this stark existentialist film about atonement betrayal death forgiveness guilt redemption and the bleakest moments of the human condition he stars as david holm a no good nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage death br br unlike many silent films during the period the film is nearly absent scenes with over acting the pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar dickensian narrative however examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time it's a very daring and unique film audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter and the cinematography is tremendous symbolic and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi layered flashbacks it's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure br br watching the film it's easy to see the later influences this film had on swedish master ingmar bergman most of the great bergman themes are here on full display of course later starred in bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness wild strawberries this would be final performance as an actor based the script on a novel by swedish writer selma of 4 stars
<START> this is a nicely done story with pretty music lots of dancing lots of big sister little sister interaction almost all of it positive and lots of wishes granted there are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy such as when king randolph exclaims they're just shoes aren't they and tender moments such as when princess genevieve comforts her youngest sister lacey after a blunder br br the animation is perhaps not as good as disney but it still is very good the facial expressions are nuanced particularly for genevieve king randolph duchess and her servant derek the cobbler and little princess lacey my only quibble on the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies of each other without the slightest deviation even the three youngest copy the dance steps perfectly i would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dancing considering that these girls are not professional or chorus dancers br br the resolution of the story is handled cleverly to get rid of a villainess without actually hurting her there is some violence done to guards in the story and the monkey is mean to other animals in the story br br my 4 year old daughter loves this movie and has watched it repeatedly and i have found it to be quite acceptable for her to watch
<START> i found this an awfully disappointing experience but i have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry br br this journey is intriguing it has drama but it is full of stereo types br br so it only serves judgemental without concern for truer justice fairness truth beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30 second ads of news that dot our multimedia experiences everyday especially news bulletins true or misleading in such depictions br br it is so exaggerated it reminds me of the fairytale of little red consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her who didn't give her an address versus the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the hand' befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer br br it seems to suit the directors management team that no one has faith or prays to god even in their times of desperation br br so in these early settings it orchestrates tells much of what is to come a nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution without truth or integrity or credibility then one twist it's all over what a disappointment if you want to see a much superior movie that investigates similar themes with much more credibility with much more powerful insight watch the 1983 paul cox norman kaye man of flowers movie br br unlike here you will not be disappointed
