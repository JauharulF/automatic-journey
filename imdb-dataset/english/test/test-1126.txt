<START> this is burt reynolds' citizen kane tragically nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching sharkey's machine it seemed to me that he put everything he had into it it is a movie that is in love with movies the opening sequence where detective single handedly rescues a bus load of hostages is an immensely exciting piece of cinema everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its own a brilliantly achieved effect it looks cold tense and dangerous on mr reynolds' streets the precinct house looks dirty and tired full of desperate people on both sides of the law shouting cursing out trying to do deals or just stay alive into this underworld descends the recently a reward for a bungled drugs bust caused by a corrupt cop he and his team are part of the vice squad information they pick up concerning a crooked politician leads them into the world of high class call girls and ruthless drug watching the apartment of one such call girl rachel ward falls in love with her portrait on the wall i know i know and when a woman's body is found with its face shot off in one of the rooms he thinks its her well i did say it was a movie that loved movies the scene where she walks in on him works beautifully even if you have seen the original the film is full of good touches i particularly like charles war story subtly acted and shot in sharp contrast to sharkey's abduction and torture which is suitably harsh and brutal i must mention vittorio gassman and henry silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever they are full on every time they're on screen and are no loss to society when their time comes mr end being extra special indeed as has been mention this is a clint eastwood movie that clint never made the biggest compliment i can pay sharkey's machine is to point out that in my opinion clint eastwood couldn't have made a better job of it the soundtrack is of an equally high standard featuring sarah vaughan joe williams julie london chet baker and other top class artists randy crawford's street life plays behind the title sequence and i can never hear it without in my mind's eye seeing striding along the sidewalk like other i have never understood why this film was a bit of a flop i hope it is due for a critical revision particularly at a time when so many cop movies and shows without a quarter of its energy freshness and sheer joie de vivre are lauded from the rooftops if you're ever tempted to think of burt reynolds as a burnt out one trick pony put sharkey's machine in your video machine i promise you won't be disappointed
<START> one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that the writers would come up with a script nope there is no story here it's like porn vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic rote and meaningless dialogue br br a bunch of germans march around shooting and getting shot slowly there are fewer germans to march around shoot and get shot then there are no germans to march around shoot and get shot br br pretty bad br br
<START> wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently actually wales seems to be developing its own little film industry i recently saw very annie mary which i thought was very good but plots with a view is not only quirky it's laugh out loud funny has a cast of wonderfully talented actors brenda blethyn is amazing and a plot that while not entirely original is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines it was the kind of movie that i wanted to watch again immediately it was over and one of very few that i would actually like to own even though many of the characters are caricatures and you have to have been to a welsh village to appreciate that they are also very human and the rapport between blethyn and molina is a joy to behold
<START> how on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation this is one of the most stylized pieces of rubbish i have seen in a long time not only is it poorly written it is a product of shoddy direction and editing the cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage jumbled beyond belief the actual ideas behind the plots cloning toxic waste climate change are all fine to begin with but where the production direction team takes them is a big cesspool of filth the likes of which are seen in one episode and this is a scientific series i am a physician and all i can say is that the science in this film is utter crap almost embarrassing to watch i really felt bad for the actors involved since they were all extraordinary
<START> but other than that there's almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original poseidon adventure where the heck are all the people from the original including the rescue crew michael caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date although he later trumps himself with jaws 4 down the road slim pickens is just embarrassing as a stereotyped texas and generally you just have to wonder why did they bother irwin allen's last stab at cashing in on the disaster craze i guess
<START> i bought x m on dvd in a two pack with destination moon now i see why the distributors did that no one who had ever seen this movie would buy it on its own br br i cannot fathom what school system turned out the reviewer who claimed that is great in its predictions of how space travel would take place launch straight up and then do a 90 degree right turn and circle faster and faster until you reach escape velocity i don't think i recall that from the apollo program never mind that the astronauts should be weightless once they shut off the engines gravity changes directions every time they pass through the hatch to the engine room going to the moon but missed it no problem it's just a hop skip and a jump with a helping hand from divine providence and you'll be at mars and ok if you want to put life on mars given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950 it was a forgivable convention for the sake of the storytelling but can you make them look at least a little alien these martians looked like extras from the cast of 10 000 b c i can accept some scientific mistakes but this wouldn't pass muster with an above average second grader br br and that's aside from the screaming plot holes 12 minutes before launch as you're reminded of constantly by the nagging p a voice saying x minus so many minutes the astronauts are giving a press conference i guess the time crunch is why dr didn't change out of his coat and tie before launching into space and how handy that even though they were planning to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that they brought hiking gear and rifles just in case they ended up at mars they're lucky they landed anywhere since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have dr e look out the window and tell the pilot lloyd bridges to tweak down the every now and then note to the designers of the 2 how about giving the pilot a window seat br br ditto the previous comments on the casual sexism that had eye candy dr lisa osa doom them all by repeatedly screwing up her fuel calculations but hey that was the early '50s she was there to fill her sweater not a useful function br br x m is notable for being one of the first of the first films to say ohmigod we're all going to blow ourselves up with these here a bombs but one can note that about it without wasting 77 minutes watching such dreck by the way that message might have had a bit more impact had there been some money in the budget for actual sets of the martian city ruins rather than just matte paintings br br i can appreciate good bad sci fi for the unique way the future used to look and for the inherent if condescending humor you can find when when we look back on the naivety of audiences 60 years ago but this film must have been insulting even then x m isn't even suitable for an mst3k style lampooning sometimes bad is just bad br br anybody want to buy a dvd used only once i swear
<START> wild rebels was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie triple feature 40 years ago it hasn't aged very well but it was never meant to age well it was obviously intended to be disposable forgettable fun from its inception taken on that level it's a good example of the biker flick genre br br several elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar films being churned out at the same time the 'hero' steve comes off as somewhat of an unimpressive 'everyman' he's not especially brave tough talented or handsome although he does win a fight with a tough biker gang member halfway into the film and the girl gang member chooses to help him over her fellow gang member at the end of the film the soundtrack is quite well done featuring a nice style bass drum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit and although the script is pretty shallow all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy br br there are plenty of careless technical gaffes terrible for night' scenes that occur in broad daylight squealing tires in a swamp fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack instead of police sirens a bank sign made of duct tape on a ceiling tile a luger that sounds like a winchester 30 06 shotgun blasts that cut down people 100 yards away a detective killing a biker on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2 inch barrel br br there are a whole bunch of goofy story elements linda the girl gang member a bank guard with a drug filled syringe the final shootout takes place inside a lighthouse police don't actually block roads the police apparently never heard of ducking and the police detectives apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their undercover guy wearing a wire br br but the plot chugs along the cameraman knows what he is doing the pacing in most scenes is pretty good and there are some nice zippy one liners and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the energy level up my favorite man you're messing with private stock ie linda so no don't seek this one out or anything but if a copy of the mst version should fall in your hands you should have some good shallow fun watching it vastly superior to five the hard way or the or even 'girl in gold three other mst covered counter culture movies
<START> something of a disappointment lee j cobb is the anti union head of garments in new york his partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty seven floors to the bottom of the shaft in the scariest scene in the film br br cobb doesn't know it or doesn't let himself realize it but the man behind the killing is richard boone who protects the business from union organizers br br then son kerwin mathews returns from europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop he's shocked shocked to learn that boone has been clobbering the union members and killing a few who have become irretrievably irritating br br robert loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by a couple of boone's goons led by wesley addy loggia leaves behind a widow gia scala with whom mathews understandably and takes up br br in the end cobb pays for his self deception addy and boone get their just desserts and mathews winds up with the succulent scala after whom an opera house is named br br there isn't a sparkle in any line of dialog a couple of lines are stolen verbatim from on the waterfront you'll talk yourself right into the grave the plot is schematic and holds absolutely no surprises vincent sherman's direction is pedestrian the photography is flat an uninspired though there are a couple of nice shots of new york streets br br lee j cobb can act in this case it must have been easy for him because he replays johnny friendly from on the waterfront only this time with a soft heart richard boone can act too joseph wiseman in a minor part does a good job gia scala hits her marks says what the script demands and does what the director tells her to a stunning woman her life soured early on the director and photographer do a good job on wesley addy he has white hair a face eyes the color of a glacial lake and he's sometimes shot through a wide angle lens than turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into those of some kind of parasitic fish i don't see him as a low tier muscle man though he and boone should have switched roles harold j stone is his reliable self although he's forced to be more italian as tony than comes naturally to him nobody else in anything resembling a major part is more than mediocre and some performers don't clear even that bar kerwin mathews may be a nice guy in real life but he's blandly sterile and belongs in domestic dramas on afternoon television br br great title suggestive of intrigue and shadows some good people in the cast a potentially explosive expose of a business nobody knows much about but which deals in megabucks br br and it all comes out like this
<START> although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out this is a total lie in fact apart from the opening segment the film isn't even a horror movie with its sunken treasure legions of fish people and mad scientists it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie obviously this film is no work of art but it's kind of fun to watch just be warned that the beginning is quite gory
<START> one of the funniest most romantic and most musical movies ever definitely worth renting buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography br br the animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie a definite must for madonna fans o
<START> director and co writer alejandro amenabar didn't make things easy for viewers of his taut a bit overlong but very disturbing story accurately based on a spanish man's struggle to obtain assisted suicide mar the sea inside is gripping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater br br with the award winning canadian movie the barbarian invasions folks got to see a family along with a coterie of devoted friends address the wish of a beloved albeit irascible man to end his life in that movie the center of attention suffered from progressive incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal stage was fast emotional as the scenes were death was inevitable the question was how gentle could it be made through solicited intervention br br ramon brilliantly played by javier bardem is a different story for well over two decades he's been a because of a diving accident very sharp viewers may detect a terrible irony as to why he ended in that condition because of his dive once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women he now lies trapped in an immobile body his every need attended to by a truly devoted family who willingly surrender much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relation br br rosa lola a single mom of two small boys enters the household out of what might have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed man's plight but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for ramon as well as an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence a nice performance by br br the problem of course is that isn't sick in the normal sense he may well live for decades more with proper care so his softly but persistently voiced desire to end his life with dignity creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who not surprisingly react from different ethical and religious perspectives br br ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing spain's laws concerning assisted suicide death with dignity is their watchword gene clara is a sensitive activist who enlists the aid of pro bono counsel julia belen julia has her own health issues which carry an indefinite but catastrophic happily married to a devoted spouse she bonds emotionally with her client br br what follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions ramon lives with his brother and wife their teenage son not the intellectual ramon is and his aged dad who can't stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness br br the moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account ramon's feelings and views it may be spain but the issues are alive in most countries including the u s br br especially amusing is a shouted first floor to bedroom debate between ramon with a drop in lecturing jesuit priest also a but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul br br special kudos to mabel rivera ramon's sister in law for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together and the same compliment extends to belen julia who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate br br the director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and at times movingly like dead man walking this movie can support any view about its deadly subject br br no one can stop a person from committing suicide if he she is determined but the universal tragedy of the world's is that without assistance life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals br br the cinematography is well matched to the story and the beautiful scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globe trotting ramon experiences from his special bed br br 9 10
<START> the shanghai cobra starts out like gangbusters with a rain soaked diner scene straight out of shack out on 101 or gun crazy the first one unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful mantan moreland it's as if director blew half his budget in the first five minutes just getting the set up the way he wanted it watch the beginning and think about the city story

<START> in the film we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the history after it is reclaimed from the belgians and we see the motives behind those men into whose hands the raped and starving country fell br br is not a movie for the hyper masses it demands the attention of its viewers with raw truthful acting and intricate packed dialogue little of the main plot is shown through action it relies almost solely on words but there is a recurring strand that is only action and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that the independence gave birth to br br this film is real it is raw depiction of those in power and those on the streets it is eye opening in its content and it is moving in the passions and emotions of its superbly portrayed characters br br whether you are a history fan a film buff or simply like good stories is a must see
