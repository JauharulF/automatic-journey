<START> the screen writers for this mini series should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves they butchered a very fun story and squandered the talents of richard e grant the only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name all of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same i strongly suggest watching another version of the scarlet pimpernel any other version is better than this one
<START> i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience in other words the creators planed to make comedy not drama at the end i realized that mr tony was earnest about this movie it's a pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is a fishy tale poor ryan phillippe despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance what to say for jason statham lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction for this reasons i vote 3 10
<START> those two main characters and stefan are a munich comedy act i was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing but when i saw this movie i was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it br br all in all very amusing and not a common german movie
<START> don't look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting sure it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little b film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head br br as i said the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so i can't really complain the story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing i thought the gore was a lot of fun too there's just something great about older gore films because they didn't have cgi back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves see this one for a good time
<START> in the 60's cleveland television audiences could watch a episode of flash gordon as part of the show 11 30pm friday this was the best material any of us in junior high had ever seen we would have regular sleepovers although we did not call them that just to get in on the fun of watching this stuff with a group of friends then the next week we would quote our favorite cornball lines from the latest episode br br watching it today provokes much the same reaction but if you can stop laughing at the dialogue the lame creatures the silly costumes and the horrible spaceships long enough there are some good things i did not appreciate the first time through the production designers built some excellent sets both the rooms and the laboratory devices charles ming the merciless character was the all time best screen villain certainly up to that time and arguable better than anyone since jean rogers is staggeringly beautiful br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> do not see this film in most cases such as that of ju on and the grudge the japanese film are infinitely better than the american remake however this movie was terrible the ghosts much like a trick or dressed as a sheet ghost moan and in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is just horrible the story itself is inconsistent and confusing not everything is explained leaving the film to go from bad to worse do not waste your time with this movie it's not worth it and i am sure that there are more entertaining things to do like watching paint dry
<START> revenge of the zombies is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effort br br spoilers br br traveling in the bayou larry adams robert lowery and scott hugo are informed that a friend has deceased meeting with local dr von john carradine he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died while they are staying there they realize that the help consists of zombies reanimated dead people who are doing the bidding of their master as the bodies pile up he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before it's too late br br the good news this here gets very little right the opening is easily it's best as it's got several great marks for it from where it starts with the creepy silhouettes walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations this one works wonders for both it's mystery and great imagery the big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long slow and creepy shot these here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight the scenes in the middle where the creature reawakens inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great the last big positive is the really fun ending with the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many universal attempts this one fits in with that style from the creepy to the real action involved near the swamp this one is fun and really works with the others to give it's only real positives br br the bad news this one here only has a couple flaws but they are major ones the first one is the film's major boredom from inactivity almost nothing happens in here mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else there's only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies yet there's nothing here that devotes any action to the film this one simply doesn't have any action and that's what hurts the film it rarely generates a scenes that keeps the interest going and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is the last flaw in the film are it's pathetic excuses for zombies those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures and they really only serve several scenes this here doesn't treat the zombies as threats making them even less frightening little screen time nonthreatening nature and un modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one these here are what really hurt the film br br the final verdict with bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching this one here is a curious effort those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot br br today's rating pg mild violence
<START> this movie deviated from the bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie i hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally seen 10 commandments moses looked like a criminal in this movie not like the kind looking man heston in the 1956 movie i will not waste my time again watching this movie they tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera and not a good one at that i'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me but to each his own also it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments it probably took them 2 months to make this one the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology you would have thought they would have done better now
<START> what is wrong with also known as deadly currents though what the for the name change is i have no idea can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover br br keep it down baby i'm trying to sleep br br it's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered it's the fact the actress has has a central european accent nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states this what struck me about this thriller while watching it the way accents don't match their characters apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent a local police chief who sounds like he's an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who's either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african you soon give up following what's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak it's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations br br even if you're not curious about accents or dialects you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because is plot less things happen like a boat exploding and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to i was lost
<START> this film is not really a remake of the 1949 o'brien film which is excellent it borrows the main premise a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer but i like that the writers chose an english professor instead of a private dick as the protagonist the plot is also quite original in general the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake but what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score combined with an affected noir feel dennis quaid grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments but he's still compelling in a general way meg ryan is fine as the student helper love interest when the film gets sort of bad is when dex the prof meets the british bodyguard chauffeur and their duels are pretty laughable the bodyguard works for the rich widow played by lovely charlotte rampling but those scenes are too self consciously noir to help the film along even though the family plot line is rather interesting dex also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard which is rather coincidental in the latter part of the film a man is shot by a window and from the outside you see him jump out of it that was pretty bad direction but aside from some of these obvious flaws i think it still holds ok i certainly didn't predict the ending so that was good there is a twist and although some posters here think they were misled i thought it was a fine and believable ending dennis quaid with his weird smirks and black eyes is more likable in the right stuff great balls of fire inner space and cold creek manor but here as dex he's supposed to be somewhat of a jerk so he did fine fairly decent movie
<START> the bone snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the desert when the find them they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours the story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this the characters are well enough and the acting is pretty good br br about an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean you sigh oh that is really stupid the movie is ruined by bad writing and a non exciting ending up until that point the movie was pretty good and it is a shame that it took such a bad turn so i cannot recommend this movie i gave it a 4 10
<START> in the 1930s hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy charley chase and the little rascals most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time however a lesser known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and zasu pitts later todd was paired with the equally untalented patsy kelly try as i might i just can't stand these pictures they just aren't funny plus unlike laurel and hardy there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co stars before you just think i am a crank understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies so i am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre this team is among the worst part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower tier team at roach they were given all the scripts no one else wanted if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea it was often given to todd and pitts kelly and usually it showed br br in this film however the team is at their absolute lowest it's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot the film begins with zasu in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer as for zasu she's a completely annoying moron not the lovable type moron like stan laurel or lou costello but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious as for thelma as usual she's the rather bland straight man and as such has little to do but react to boorish behavior br br the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills considering that the pills are highly dangerous when the attorney asks zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb and while they were called pills they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense even for a low brow comedy when they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends br br as i said i am not a fan of this team however even for those who want to like the film there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short when i talked over this review with my wife who also saw the movie with me she thought my score of 2 was overly generous
<START> how do you describe perfection in the mood for love maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection top notch acting and the sensual soundtrack nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie maggie and tony look marvelous with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious and tony always looking dapper i've seen this movie several times already and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about love it
<START> honestly i am not that impressed by it it's not a bad movie but it's not great one either there's a story to tell but it's told in a very incoherent way which kinds of makes it loose it's full meaning and ability to intrigue this movie could of been made in another way with an outstanding result the story is just so interesting yet somehow i'm not intrigued when watching it br br it definitely isn't an amateur movie rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional the actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but there's just something so unfinished by the whole movie that i cant quite put my finger on perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters more all the of the movie could of been better clarified and put more 'action' throughout it cause as it was it became slow from time to time
<START> the film has so much potential which was not developed mark hamill gives a good performance and so does bill paxton the scenery is beautiful and the aircraft are neat the problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere the film at certain points almost puts you to sleep i give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes
