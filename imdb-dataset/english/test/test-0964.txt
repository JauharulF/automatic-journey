<START> i initially tuned in to paranormal state because i more or less find the paranormal search genre to be interesting tv if nothing else br br i really enjoy ghost hunters because well over half of their investigations result in total debunking and find most haunted to be hilarious with its use of mediums and frumpy british women with paris hilton day glo eyes fainting from fear demonic presences all shot in lovely night vision green br br paranormal state has none of this appeal it feels like it was cobbled together from leads that ghost hunters rejected the episodes ranged from trailer trash families and single mothers with emo adolescents sitting around and scaring themselves to an interview with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room the monster goes we are told all of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems the whole show is about ryan and his partner his enormous ego he leads his troupe of doe eyed coeds around except when a case is deemed too extreme and orders them to remain at the hotel hahaha better leave it to the pros ie himself br br the unwitting comedy of this show is all in how gullible the participants are ryan spins his tales of being hunted followed etc by a demon that he first encountered when the catholic church recruited him to assist on a case sorry but the catholic church has people who can do that they don't need the day shift manager at to chip in his 2 cents br br this show is awful shame on a e for bankrolling this silliness trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal themed shows it's almost unintentionally funny except that ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn't worth the trouble
<START> in hoot a new kid arrives to florida from montana he first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully soon though he becomes aware of a bigger problem a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town right where a number of burrowing owls live this movie has the look of a family film but it is pretty more radical than it seems as it shows sympathetically how roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants in the name of environmentalism to save owls no less now one might agree or not with those actions but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions a good solid film all in all
<START> this show was rushed and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials when it came back from commercial the noise or surprise was something simple like a mouse this is a pure rip off of ghost hunters and it attempts to go beyond them and fails miserably also what is with the directors log thing is this star trek it just ruins the novelty of this show which wore off quick the only reason it's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti climatic nature of it they never find anything and most likely never will funnily enough they always point out something that is the thing they are hunting and guess what it's the local radio station's tower light that is blinking red
<START> it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed racer be it dubbed or subbed i prefer the dubbed version which is rare because it was funny in a good way what's great about speed racer is that you're never too old to watch it go red and yellow i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening it disappeared for some time then i saw it again a couple of months ago i'm 19 imagine the feeling of nostalgia surging in singing here he comes here comes speed racer he's a demon on wheels over and over again anyway the concept of the mach 5 spawned so many multi function special but none were able to surpass its genius in construction the other cars just seemed too much and it wasn't just the races or battling different bosses that made it interesting for me it was racer x's mystery persona and how the world of speed racer pretty much to revolve around it they did some tweaking to some story lines from the manga but it all turned out pretty well though i can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer x looked like in the manga they did

<START> i have just seen a couple of nights ago at the annual vistas film festival held here in dallas and i must express my discontent the opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of south american countries costa in this particular case by north american oil companies and the negative effects both economic and environmental of this invasion the main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm right away a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half sister i'm not going to go into specifics about this and to be honest i don't feel that i'm spoiling anything with this review yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy so the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to preserve his livelihood on one hand the reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation basically a bribe to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town compromising his standing with the community and the community itself on the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community protesting the drilling given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just doesn't happen and i'll tell you why you will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award i'm not going to pick apart esteban's direction it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything the audience award was at a film festival in spain and for it to gain an audience award i'd have to imagine that spanish people just dig soap operas in fact central and south america dig soap operas as well i know that much i assume that esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes the only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is it's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely from time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are digressions at best what we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc these themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company becomes unnecessary it's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama soap opera by throwing in a little political relevance nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with here are two things that i think could have saved this movie either cut out the half sister or cut out the oil company it's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in or perhaps if had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out regardless i'd have been fine with a straight up soap opera and i think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community is both and neither these two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with both sides suffer best of all the romance plot is never even resolved i'd like to say i'd watch this movie again to see what i've missed but i have a strong feeling that i already know what it is as far as i'm concerned it wouldn't matter if i saw ten more times i've missed it because it is simply not there
<START> this film was a wonderful romp intelligent playful mysterious full of surprises with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy the famous film director the protagonist and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him there are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director the ending is so much the better for being untidy realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here if we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors we should be prepared for a wild ride this film seems to suggest
<START> i really wanted to like this film especially after all the buzz i'd heard revolving around it but sadly it just didn't work for me paranoid park suffers from the same delusion lost in translation did if you use very little dialogue be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful br br much of the plot line if you can find a plot of this film is contrived i wasn't impressed with the it all down' confessional being the way the protagonist deals with the accident so what are we supposed to believe he grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences thus was vindicated for that horrific incident br br what is i suspect supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is directionless and faced with an impossible moral quandary instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality he has no connection to anyone around him and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong he has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends what we have is a portrait of a non person a spirit that merely coasts through life as he weaves his way along on his skateboard i don't feel for him at all and honestly i wish he'd been caught the entire film centres not necessarily on his feelings of guilt but on how he is going to avoid punishment and or accountability for a bad decision he not only gets away with it he finds a way to subtly it quite a frightening negative message the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and that they simply make up the rules as they go along serving themselves for good or ill i find it an insulting on today's youth and the pretentious arrogance of the film maker drips thick with every plodding step and shifting eye br br he did murder the guard but if you blink your eyes you miss it whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to say it could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard when he runs to the security guard's car one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood
<START> obviously this is not the piranha directed by joe dante and produced by roger corman it wasn't so obvious when i bought the dvd for only 2 95 as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy horror piranha even the dvd menu no features of course matched the cover half way through watching this odd movie my girlfriend and i started thinking where are the piranhas once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer which had completely different footage the blurb on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits actors producer director were also completely different instead we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter this tame exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old school camp value strange that a dvd can be manufactured with the wrong film in tact but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b grade movies of the same name made in the 70's reading other posts made on this film i noticed that i'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd how could this be an international error is there perhaps some sort of dvd phenomena where unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds what is going on
<START> i was a marine at camp pendleton when the d i came out 1st marine division 11th marine regiment 3rd battalion i battery i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the star theater in california br br we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea i believe they were all real drill instructors too as good an actor as jack webb was he just couldn't call cadence like a real marine drill instructor br br all of us got a laugh when the problem mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain never in a million years would this have happened but that's hollywood and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie br br i went through boot camp at in san diego during the summer of 1956 and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d i 's could do to you the ribbon creek event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp at least not at san diego br br i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt moore's stiffness around his girl friend i believe this was just webb's acting style and although they could have deleted this part of the movie it didn't really hurt the production that much br br one minor note the character uncredited of pvt rodriguez was played by one of my drill instructors sgt peter j o'neill sgt o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor we secretly laughed at this but he surprised us all he was a great drill instructor and i thought he did well in his bit part also he really did enjoy throwing knives he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp i have often wondered if he is still alive
<START> this is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen one has to take anything by truffaut seriously it's not just some b movie cranked out by hacks br br evidently truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick and neither could deneuve whose dozen character flip flops are simply unbelievable not even badly acted just not acted at all among other things how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's the clichÃ© ending which i won't describe is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake
<START> i enjoyed two of the three movies in the sarah plain tall trilogy this the final of the three was definitely one of the good ones it is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars christopher walken glenn close and jack palance br br the storyline is simple but well told the only sub par performance was by one of the kids it was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie br br of the three that initial sarah was the best filmed with some beautiful cinematography this movie didn't have that but it had the best story it had some genuinely tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending br br highly recommended
<START> isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la pianiste truly confirms it as if that wasn't enough annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through isabelle and annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i don't believe in the director's intentions i don't believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me you can't afford to miss la pianiste
<START> well after the hype surrounding the film and after surya labeling the film as path breaking i went into the theatre expecting something big boy was i disappointed br br first of all the characterizations in the film are so weird which wife would do what jyothika did an idiotic coo coo one and what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child baby after she and her husband had a fight what was the purpose of that scene anyway to start a vulgarly shot not only was the song not canned aesthetically it was just not needed in the screenplay not needed at all secondly the first half of the had practically no story the entire first half was a freaking drag every scene in the first half of the film had no significance what so ever to the real story of the film and also how did aishwarya bhoomika chawla change so radically all of a sudden and how did gautham surya and lead a happy live together after six years even though they were so unhappy about marrying each other and if gautham did love aishwarya like he claimed he did why did he even marry even if it was his uncle's death wish why that's the question you keep asking whilst watching the film and how fair is the ending to aishwarya after all she was gautham's first wife krishna the director of the film claimed he worked on the script of this film for two years but his script is filled with flaws and leaves the audience utterly irritated thirdly krishna's un imaginative picturizations of awesome is just disappointing surprisingly anthony's editing usually superb for the new york song just sucks the whole song looked like it was a slide show made on microsoft power point chorus was wasted showing gautham playing football who wants to see the freaking dude playing football during such a beautiful chorus whats more the whole movie only needed two songs and adi the rest of the songs inclusive of new york and oru are just not needed fine efforts are simply wasted on a stupid film directed by an amateur director fans of rahman you ask why rahman keeps moving to bollywood after looking at the way his songs are picturised in why would he want to stay here what's more irritating is that after krishna decided to include into the film the song was cut by half which truly truly br br surya looks handsome in his new get ups save the ones during the college scenes and packs in a so and so performance his expressions during all the songs he was featured in really do not fit the way the singer sings the songs was jyothika even acting in the film all she did was cry would you call all that crying acting one of her worst performances ever what's more her new hairstyle does not suit her she looked way better in her costumes during the new york song are way off bhoomika chawla is just gorgeous during the film and does justice to her role comedy is annoying when one is watching him one wishes they could slap him on the face it is who is the show stealer during the comedy scenes and why the heck did even agree to do such a minuscule role which could have done by just anyone and why is her make up so heavy when she has perfect music by a r rahman is just awesome new york and oru deserve special mention r d cinematography is ok and isn't as good as his previous films though the scenery during the adi song deserve special mention anthony's editing is really really disappointing the film is just so freaking draggy and could be trimmed severely br br krishna's direction just sucks dialogues a c and krishna are just too corny to digest especially the part where bhoomika professes her love for surya the screenplay and script krishna are horibble the film moves in the more un interesting pace ever and krishna's script is just filled with unexplained sub plots br br and for goodness sakes why was there so much advertising in the film pepsi maggi suzuki you name it was the producer of the film k e low on budget or was he just desperate overall oru is a damp squib with a title like that one would expect a heart warming and cooling love story but what you end up is a painfully botched up love story really really disappointing
<START> incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman who went insane leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path i know there are several versions of this and this is based on the 102 one that i watched but i can't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck br br i'd heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex nudity which honestly there isn't much of here at all and boring when there is and blood but beware it's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project camera work is hopelessly inept full of strange zooms failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy photo quality lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven is it day or night are they in or outside have they changed scenes who is or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much it's tragic br br a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan burnt and fellini like turkey that's only good for a few gobble laughs and peter o'toole who makes a most memorable oh yes which brings us to the big name actors i'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this there i've wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time period br br 1 out of 10 from ozjeppe
