<START> oppenheimer was a great series it was the first thing i saw waterston in and it is too bad copies aren't available a similar situation exists for glory enough for all a british series from around the same time about the discovery of i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was danger uxb a series about defusing unexploded bombs hence the name that one you can get from your local library br br pete
<START> this is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows a certain dixie boy johnson whether this person ever really existed i don't know but considering the cast lists a certain lee white and roscoe karns playing said character as well i assume the man did exist and that this is a white washed pardon the pun version of his career the plot such as it is follows dixie boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth his abandonment of the child to friends and his return at his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation another forgotten man benny fields plays dixie boy the man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen gladys george valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail judy clark does the best impersonation of betty hutton i've ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself the scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar nom worth a look
<START> i must admit i liked this movie and didnt find it all misogynist it could be subtitled three ways of looking at liv tyler three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters one man john goodman tells his story to a priest the very funny richard jenkins for goodmans the liv tyler character is an idealized saint the second coming of his wife theresa for paul character who story to a shrink a fine understated performance by the great reba mcintire the liv tyler character is object of kinky sexual fantasy finally matt rather dimwitted tells his side of the story to a sleazy hit man played by micheal douglas all three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneously and all are amusing the film ends in a bizarrely funny climax that i wont give away
<START> although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas seeing this film left me a little short br br it had promise the characters and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they did yet the story seemed not to understand the direction it wanted to take br br the and parallels within the story especially the three generations of women in the family had a lot of potential but somehow didn't fully extend itself it could have made the film much easier to relate to and attach to which is the aim of any film about lost love and life regained br br imho i think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the writing although harry jnr and sandra bullock did try desperatly to breath a little life into otherwise flat character outlines br br it's not that this is a bad film some parts leave you understanding the reasons for various plot developments its just that this film is underdone and a little flat overall
<START> my mom my cousins and i are pretty big jane austen fans we know all the words to the 1995 pride and prejudice masterpiece and have watched gwyneth paltrow's emma an embarrassing number of times i've read all the books and i've even sat through sense and sensibility and persuasion a few times so my mom and i thought it would be nice to see northanger abbey on film br br bad idea this is just about the worst movie i've ever seen it's even worse than the 1998 version of alice through the looking glass or the 1939 nancy drew movie i bought at wal mart for 1 my previous worst movies the first thing wrong which you notice in the opening scene is that the heroine catherine has a gruesome and weird imagination inspired by trashy novels that a jane austen heroine would never touch throughout the novel she has dreams day and night in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig dragged across a field headed for god knows what all and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse br br the second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack no dainty classical music or english country dances here it is also evident almost at first glance that the actress for lack of a better word chosen to play catherine is completely off first she is rather unattractive and is rendered even more so by her un behavior her looks and movements are just wacky plus they're completely affected and unbelievable br br this sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film not even mr the supposed dashing young suitor is decent br br as more and more characters are introduced a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident huge marie antoinette style clash with the for the most part correctly styled empire gowns a french woman apparently a friend of general is made up all in black as some sort of ancient goth nightmare she bears a striking similarity to michael jackson in a black dress her appearance is made even sillier by a huge half moon beauty mark on her cheek i also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing br br another anomaly that kept my mom and i howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the bathing scene the first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together probably not very likely in the early 1800s then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates worn around their necks with strings the plates floated on the water containing some mysterious pieces of something we guessed it was soap then aromatic herbs then finally when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots we deduced it was food but i'm still not sure br br and that's not even half of what's wrong with northanger abbey my warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie stay your hand and if anyone is considering buying it well i don't even know what to say to that br br you'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1 4 of the way through they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop unfortunately they didn't and northanger abbey was let out into the world
<START> this is a gem of a film slapstick violence a plenty simon pegg and green spew br br a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this br br if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short br br if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film br br i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts br br feeb 1 boiled egg
<START> this is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show i've ever seen i'm confounded that this guy was given his own show it smells of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable dave chapelle he's a tip from ned's bag of comedy gold is a punchline not funny need to give it that extra push into hilarity f ing yell it at the top of your lungs simple no and as an added bonus finish half your jokes with then you're re tah or duh du oh man so funny hilarious does the laughter ever stop br br to illustrate my point in a more cerebral way i'll cite an example mencia jokes about how retarded it is to rebuild new orleans because it's so close to the water genius the line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly while a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take solace in ned goes for the obvious move the city great wait is that funny ned doesn't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things the hurricane didn't flood the city ned the levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars and behold they broke i guess that's god's way of telling us we shouldn't be there after all he's got a seat in congress what a fool br br chapelle was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head he was effortless at it and at all points we were laughing with him while mencia talks about black people not being able to swim yawn chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white you don't have to be scathing to be edgy you have to be original br br mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities except of course with ned he's laughing all too emphatically at the retards du du
<START> i have seen all the film interpretations of hamlet from sir lawrence olivier to mel gibson gasp derek jacobi captures the true essence of the character from the beginning to the brutal climax superb acting all around this one should not be missed
<START> man the '90's really were an horrible decade for movies the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking br br this 6th entry into the long running halloween series is certainly a bad one you just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build up movie br br it's simply a poorly done film that also suffers from its imagine less writing and non compelling characters that are in it dr loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it it's a real shame that this had to be donald pleasence last film role it's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one br br there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie from pretty early on already he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality also the attempts to uncover myer's past don't really work out for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well it's obvious that the script went through various re writes before and also very possibly during filming several scenes even got re shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing br br the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one this is also due to the lack of some real good gore as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch br br so far the worst out of the series br br 3 10
<START> a picture starring danny devito and billy crystal they are both famous actors and in this charming comedy entails them trying to murder each other's pet peeve billy crystal's pet peeve being his ex wife who stole his book and put her name on it and danny devito's pet peeve being his malignant mother billy crystal is an author and a teacher apparently and danny devito is one of his students this comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages br br danny devito seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time she says things like you have no friends and when billy crystal fell down she said burry him before he stinks up the basement she puts down danny also by calling him lard ass and other things just to make him angry
<START> liv tyler liv tyler liv tyler yeah it's hard to keep your mind off this fetching beauty giving an radiantly picture perfect performance as she simply has tongues wagging 'one night at is a dementedly quirky and raunchy black comedy with old fashion shades tied in to its familiar but smartly crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men lusting after the one women and she's milking it to her advantage when you see tyler no wonder why they are infatuated and would do that's anything to see 'her' happy and living 'her' dreams just like tyler there's something rather intoxicating about this feature in that we see the likes of matt dillon john goodman paul reiser who's great and especially michael douglas who plays the hired assassin with cool ease but a questionable hairdo really having a good time with their roles the consuming plot opens up with the main three characters dillon goodman and reiser telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she's having on them to lead to an insane climax there's an unpredictable chain of events ranging from fruity to sensual where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic snowball twist of fate for the characters that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl howard direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script's quick fire gags and frenetically fun if complicated situations one of the best under the radar comedies in the last decade which will have you under tyler's thumb
<START> michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy alec baldwin who was an up and coming star when the film was made is a hoot dean stockwell in a sendup of john is hysterical but mercedes ruehl as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie br br jonathan demme previously known for wacky comedies like something wild and melvin and howard proves once again that he is a genius i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing silence of the lambs the performances he evokes from his actors in married are inspired and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride br br one of the cutest most endearing films of the 80's it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era
<START> you've got to watch this movie it is so bad it actually is great br br you've got your crazy but gutsy captain who of course is having an affair with his worn out used to be gorgeous and of course the mid air collision occurs when the captain's enemy and along for the ride to got your ex vietnam vet who is can't handle the pressure of another mid air collision and crash landing then you've got your old crazy army air corp buddy who is flying the chase plane and trying to well i can't tell you what he's trying to do the plane keeps going up up and well and then you've got your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then you've got your ice station zebra cold and then lucky saves the bad guy from so they can land the plane and it doesn't end it just goes on and on you've got to watch this it's great you've got to be kidding did they actually show this on commercial television and how it was ever shown on cable
<START> jackie chan movies are typical examples of how offer is bigger than demand well to be honest which demand in this one jackie chan is whatever his name is in this one i doubt if he even knows and he is some kind of race car driver well he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is sped up that way i can do all the stunts myself as well during the great finale in which jackie chan wants to arrest the bad guy by beating him in a race we finally get to see how shoddy this production really is chan's fighting especially in the casino scene is decent but when we're talking about special effects dear lord and must everyone crash in this race that's just stupid and here it's really not safe for the drivers there's not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood and don't get me started on what kind of awful story this has i mean it's hongkong it was probably written at gun point by eight year olds but still what a mess i like chan as much as the next guy perhaps more since i saw rush hour but his agent's retarded cousin really needs to pick his projects better
<START> this is what they came up with for prop comedian carrot first feature film br br a stupid surfer carrot dude inherits an r d enterprise from an old kahuna jack warden things go less than swimmingly but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate raiders the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart girl courtney thorne smith would find this red headed step child fascinating in the least but then he just inherited millions 'classic' moments include comic larry miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup br br funny comedy try un funny toilet humor and that's exactly where this belongs in the toilet flush twice
