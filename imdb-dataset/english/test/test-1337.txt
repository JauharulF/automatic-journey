<START> i registered with imdb com just so i could comment about this movie my god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was it shouldn't even be touted as a real movie this is very deceiving this is a 15 year old's film project at best the acting is terrible but even good actors could not save this the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie who the hell wrote this crap and that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about kaye being a damsel in distress got old real fast god i'd rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again do not rent this movie if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it smash it with a hammer even if smashing this video caused you to lose your hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it this is an abomination i suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant any questions email me
<START> best in show is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event the only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in best in show act more sane than their owners funny stuff from a top notch cast that includes eugene levy who co wrote the film catherine o'hara parker posey michael jennifer coolidge jane lynch and christopher guest who co wrote with levy and directed they're all funny but fred willard steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things plus the dogs are cute too best in show isn't exactly the laugh riot that i expected but there are laughs and it's worth seeing br br out of four
<START> the lone ranger was one of my childhood heroes and i never missed a chance to catch his adventures on saturday morning re runs during the mid 1950's somehow however this film got by me until i had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library i was struck by a number of elements during the story as right from the start you have a new lone ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the tv show the adventure uses tonto jay in a nicely expanded role even though he takes his share of lumps throughout getting beat up and shot more than once perhaps most interesting of all the ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations putting his character at odds with the vision created for the tv series that he would never use his weapon to kill only to wound or to protect himself and others br br aside from that you have a fairly traditional western adventure the ranger and tonto come to the aid of an indian tribe whose members are being murdered by hooded raiders attempting to track down five that together form the key to a fabulous treasure interestingly the leader of the bad guys is an already wealthy woman disarmingly portrayed by nash her top henchman is played by douglas kennedy and it was no surprise to see lane bradford as one of the baddies character was one of the men shot by the lone ranger which got me to thinking how many times that might have happened in the tv series a quick check revealed that he appeared in 'the lone ranger' show fifteen times while kennedy appeared a total of six times br br what might be most interesting of all about the picture is it's attempt to portray indians in a revisionist light at a time when tv and movie westerns were still largely portraying the red man as an illiterate savage the character of dr james rolfe norman is the most revealing in that regard he's an indian who attained an education and went on to become a doctor returning to the land of his tribe to tend to the needs of all it's citizens for purposes of the story he had to impersonate a white man to be accepted by the local ranchers this was the hardest thing for me to accept about the story line actually as dr rolfe was the grandson of the elderly chief john miljan that no one in the story except lisa knew that he was really an indian was something of a stretch for me i suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age but without that back story fleshed out it didn't make sense to me that no one else from the tribe would know who he was br br i don't know why i'm intrigued by this so much but after watching and reviewing over two hundred westerns on this site i've suddenly come across three films in the past month that utilize a blanket pull gimmick like the one performed by horse scout in this picture roy rogers' trigger did a similar stunt in son of paleface and i caught it again in the big country by a horse named old thunder in that flick it's done as a bit of comic relief in a situation that wouldn't normally come up for a horse and it now makes me curious when the bit might have been first done i'll have to keep watching more old time westerns not to be outdone silver had a chance to shine in the picture as well making the save of an indian baby that was about to be used as a hostage by bad guy brady br br speaking of gimmicks clayton moore borrowed a tactic from the tv series when he donned a disguise as a southern gentleman to smoke out the villains posing as the hooded raiders whenever he would do so in the half hour format it was always clever enough to hide his real features usually with a beard as done here one of the more interesting episodes i recall had to do with the ranger impersonating an actor in the guise of abraham lincoln br br keep an eye out for a couple of goofs i spotted along the way in an early scene at the opening an indian is shot by one of the hooded raiders and in a close up there's blood on his shirt but no bullet hole later on in the story ross brady and wilson ride up on the indians after they've kidnapped one of the villains out of jail brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders but is immediately shown about to make his getaway on horseback with wilson
<START> otto preminger was one of the great maverick film directors like john huston he was a character from one of his own movies like mr huston he was a wonderful ham who slipped in and out of performance at random but the final product of his labours was unmistakably his own with a few exceptions films are now made by corporations not individuals and as a result are usually highly polished packages a product in much the same way as a golf ball a tin of dog food or a motor car is a product the involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidental such is the appetite for the product that there appears no end to the line of well finished glossy superficially entertaining but ultimately empty films that flood the countless tv channels and movie outlets there is no time for a man like mr preminger to stand a little apart from the torrent of product and craft a personal work of art of course there has always been the art for art's sake money for christ's sake ethos in film making but now has in all but name been consigned to history's cutting room floor today otto preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering pizzas in hollywood half a century ago having made the hugely influential laura where the sidewalk ends and the moon is blue he set about filming nelson controversial novel the man with the golden arm in his eccentric and individualistic manner rather than take his camera out onto the streets he stayed in the studio and used stylised almost expressionistic sets quirky casting mr frank sinatra hot from his success in from here to eternity the young inexperienced but breathtakingly beautiful miss kim novak and mr arnold a man whose oddities were after his own heart and a remarkable era defining score by elmer bernstein featuring the cream of west coast an otto preminger film was always an all round experience to be considered as a whole rather than breaking it down into acting directing photography what appeared on the screen was preminger's vision his creation and his interpretation of novel not a film of novel any one of twenty competent hollywood hacks have produced that from the first hi hat cymbal beat that accompanies saul iconic title sequence we are drawn into preminger's take on what is nowadays called the life in truth a murky area occupied by hustlers junkies cops drug dealers stone gamblers jazz musicians their women and hangers on the lines are blurred in the life and it's dog eats dog down there the inhabitants circle each other like sharks looking for a sign of weakness to be exploited frankie machine mr sinatra a professional card dealer ex junkie and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim when things get tough he goes back to the needle although he kicks the habit by going cold turkey there are absolutely no guarantees that he won't go straight back on it further down the line mr sinatra's depiction of an addict in the throes of withdrawal has divided the critics but the fact of the matter is that even fifty years later most of us have probably never seen such a thing in real life so we don't know how accurate the portrayal is when i first saw the film in the late 50s i was very impressed watching it recently on video it seemed to put it unkindly hammy perhaps he is a victim of his own success as many actors subsequently doing cold turkey have with the passing of the years taken his performance and refined it somewhat arnold is outstanding as pal sparrow a performance he exceeded only in it's a mad mad mad mad world try and watch it on the big screen and view it as the cinematic vision of a true auteur a giant amongst today's pygmies otto preminger
<START> possible spoilers three young people on the wrong side of the law are given a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in the mod squad ' a resurrection of the hit television series of the directed by scott silver given their less than stellar backgrounds and because of who they are and the people they know julie barnes claire danes pete cochran giovanni ribisi and lincoln hayes omar epps can go places other cops can't so they are tapped by captain adam greer dennis farina to infiltrate a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring for a start julie gets a job there as a waitress while pete and just hang out' to find out what they may julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old boyfriend billy waites josh brolin who turns out to be involved with drugs which are tied in to the shady dealings going down at the bar before it's over the is in it up to their necks while also running afoul of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs and consequently tied in with their investigation from the beginning of the movie there is a sense that you are coming in late as if it's that you know what's going on as far as the origin and workings of the squad all you get here are brief mug shot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past there's nothing about how this all actually came about the thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story quicker get things moving along while this is true to a certain extent some added background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting the way it was done here merely the credibility of the entire proceedings the plot is marginal to begin with and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while what's delivered and quite unimaginatively at that is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters the performances are satisfactory but the actors get no help from the script nor apparently from silver danes ribisi and epps come close to fleshing out julie pete and but given the time allotted them combined with the lack of support they still fall way short of giving these people life farina a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the good cop ' there's a feeling that everything was given the once over in this film some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one the supporting cast includes richard jenkins detective steve harris briggs larry lionel mark smith lanier and sam tricky it's a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie as it is it comes across as ill conceived and poorly executed danes ribisi and epps are like major leaguers who got stuck playing for all the marbles at the local instead of getting a shot at the title they all got hung out to dry like terry says in on the waterfront ' you was my brother charlie you shoulda been looking out for me ' well it's obvious that there was no charlie to look out for them here and after the mod squad ' they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time i rate this one 1 10
<START> i am not a big fan of the spielberg cruise version of this film and so i must throw in with the more humble version c thomas had more heart and more sympathy that cruise in the lead role at least in my opinion now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars there would be nothing left no special effects no sets no cruise because i doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the david michael version so comparing apples to i guess i have to go with the at least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market
<START> this film had a couple of funny parts but for the most part made me want to go ahead and change dvd's and watch malibu's instead which i had in my own collection at least i would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to look forward to br br i was disappointed in this very low budget film and i do not judge a movie by it's budget it just lacked originality and was too predictable i would not rent or even watch this film again and i am usually a repeat offender of film the actors were forgettable the story was half thought out and it left me with an insatiable urge to get my laugh on i ended up watching jamie kennedy's white boy gone gangsta to have the comedy itch scratched
<START> the plot a trucker kristofferson battles a corrupt sheriff borgnine by getting his fellow truckers to band together and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy br br the negative the film's setup is weak and the ending even weaker it has all the good ole boy trucker clichÃ©s without adding anything new in the process it ends up making smokey and the bandit look brilliant and inspired kristofferson is much too laid back for a leading man role and cannot carry the picture borgnine's character is portrayed awkwardly at the start he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overacts to a minor contrivance that starts the whole thing rolling then at the end he is made out to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly siding with kristofferson which doesn't work at all in either case jackie gleason is a much better actor for this type of role the worst part about the movie though is director peckinpah's attempts to throw in a message' into this silly action flick that does nothing but slow it down and bomb in the process br br the positive the only good scene in the whole film is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant director peckinpah puts a funny spin to his trademark 'slow violence and the result is amusing unfortunately he starts putting all the action into slow motion during the rest of the picture until it eventually becomes tiring mcgraw is always a pleasure to look at but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do br br the lowdown if you've read the synopsis than you have essentially the movie the song that this movie is based on is pretty good but the movie adds nothing to it and should never have been made this is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick director br br the rating 3 out of 10
<START> this game is an action adventure with combat there are quite long periods with no combat but other times you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest the whole game is a quest you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in dos i used and was able to play the game quite well the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky but others look batter but don't let that put you off the game the game is very imaginative its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway but over 13 or 14 might like this game its a horror mystery action adventure combat combination i thought it was a great game its had to find now maybe ebay but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use oh and the acting is very good too
<START> the powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre despite the ominous title jake gyllenhaal guested on conan o'brien to promote the movie and explained that was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture since 9 11 allowed the government's intelligence agency to extricate people without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information br br gyllenhaal plays rookie cia analyst douglas freeman note the irony who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the us br br omar plays the suspected terrorist anwar el egyptian national and green card carrying hubby of american isabella fields el reese witherspoon isabella and her son wait for anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest she seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the head of intelligence corrine whitman meryl streep is behind it all br br rendition is directed by hollywood newbie gavin hood who is set to do x men origins wolverine and begs the question of whether such is exercised in real life the movie was released locally in the wake of the explosion bombing mishap and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer's spine seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign on the upper right hand of the screen plus the effect of silence and slow moving images magnified the impact of the scene's real life coincidence br br there are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make daily we all have choices we can exercise at will and we often do not always want to see how these affect others who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance what 'the greater good' is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source now that's a utopia worth building
<START> german born turkish director faith akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in istanbul a city that is a bridge between east and west a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the in europe and in asia kurdish represented by who performs her own brand of kurdish gospel music passionate and melodic we are introduced to romany to who has been called the elvis of music sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as faith akin takes us into underground clubs to the street performers and to recording sessions german bassist alexander who comes to istanbul to play and to learn about turkish music quotes confucius to understand the place you have to listen to the music it plays akin's fine documentary does just that gives us 90 minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges for me watching the movie was especially interesting because i recently visited istanbul as a part of my vacation and spent four days there the city fascinated me by its images colors crowds vibrancy and visual beauty now i can add the sounds of music to the ever changing portrait of istanbul
<START> i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter o'toole susannah york michael craig harry andrews might be worth watching alas i was wrong utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about i've a feeling o'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister york he is also barking mad but apart from that your guess is as good as mine br br the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary unimaginative stagy piffle clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director risible
<START> in the goofs section for this film there's a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene this is incorrect one of the views is from flat the other is from flat across the street the whole purpose of this segment is to show how and auguste who may be made for each other almost cross paths as happens several other times but never quite do so until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film and here there is the implication that joseph has manipulated things so that auguste is on that ferry having inspected ticket to see which sailing she is booked on
<START> after reading other reviews on this site we weren't sure if we were going to be able to critique this movie because it didn't sound bad enough however 2 minutes into the movie we knew we were in for another flop no summer is complete without ice cream but this movie served up a melted sour broken bottomed ice cream cone you know the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet nap the biggest problem with this movie was the plot what was it it appeared to be a psychotic ice cream man driving around the neighborhood that's it nothing else happens first of all what are the qualifications for becoming an ice cream man in this crap town 1 spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man this hospital was plagued with clowns graffiti fake plastic and oversized syringes to the head 2 have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids away 3 make sure your truck is stocked with severed body parts roaches and don't forget the eye whites br br the actors in this movie are pure b movie caliber mixed in with a bunch of unknowns is who other than a trailer trash version of macaulay culkin even his bratty charm couldn't save this kick in the pants there seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie the whole concept of the movie reeked who would kill an ice cream man in a drive by shooting gangsters fiends white who we are still struggling with this question br br whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted from hollywood did they honestly think a pillow under a kid's shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat did they forget about the arms face legs and all other body parts second of all this movie was made in 1995 yet the wardrobe seemed to be picked from a lame 80's movie evidenced by the big brother's white crotch hugging high water pants br br while we were watching this shotty production we both developed severe cases of add we found ourselves leaving the room to walk around aimlessly at many points it the movie we found that staring at a blank wall behind the t v set was more entertaining than the actual movie we were stunned that this movie didn't make it to the bottom 100 afterwards we took the tape out of the vcr and left it on the black top to melt like a sub standard ice cream cone
