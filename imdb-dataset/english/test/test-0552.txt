<START> me being from australia and loving the series i wasn't expecting much from the american version of and kim but i thought i'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad br br well whats there to say its nothing special selma blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines molly shannon is not a good though the good thing about jane turner's is that when she speaks with all her funny accents such as when she says or it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as turner and the show really misses sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the kal and craig characters in this version are really not funny br br so far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better but if there is nothing else to do on a sunday night or thursday night in america then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the aussie version if you've got it
<START> the plot four people are caught in an elevator one is a business man the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking talking sample of distilled stress and hostility then there's his colleague a woman who is much more pleasant in her character a teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad and an older guy who just stole 100 make up the rest of the cast br br the movie is all about how they cope with their problem as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world as the lights go out and as the cables begin to snap one after the other br br and yet it isn't too exciting the characters are stereotypes the story is stupid and unlikely how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator you don't like the characters very much you just hate one of them and all the twists and turns in the plot are not contributing to the excitement they are just stupid excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and ink on a full length movie set in an elevator br br let's just hope phone booth will be a better effort
<START> when i first saw race against fear don't you just love lmn movie titles i had to keep scratching my head was this meant to be serious why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running much less like a star runner how did i know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film all of these questions and no answers then i just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away it was easier not to resist then the film became funnier by the minute and i now rank it among my top ten junk movies from lmn some have said here that ariana richards is really talented but that the material was flawed i heartily disagree not only can she not convince me that she's an athlete she's walks wide eyed through the rest of the story like she's just landed on earth maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off at least i hope so
<START> this movie has it all great actors good dialog drama comedy and excellent writing and directing by paul thomas anderson i have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time it doesn't get old it is consistently entertaining and stimulating easily burt reynolds best role and he does a great job john c reilly and don cheadle also give excellent comedic performances there is not a weak element in this film
<START> i don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long br br i saw this film on tv i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably 10 minutes but that does not matter this film literally gripped me it is a real spine chiller br br the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tense even though there are many new faces their performances were top class br br the filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest the shock fear horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film br br the well written situations n twists fast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller this film actually switches between the genres horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock br br i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film
<START> this movie earns its 3 for lousy writing poor technical merit and continuity problems some people have given this movie a 10 and perhaps that is okay if you are simply scoring it for its fun factor however technically this is an inept movie serial from start to finish produced by 3rd rate writers actors and crew that really was true of nearly all the serials because they were meant as low brow entertainment particularly aimed at the kids and there's nothing wrong with that but high art it ain't spy earns a lower than average score compared to other serials because it is of even lower quality and has major continuity problems even for a serial it was common for a serial to have a cliff hanger i e a moment at the end of the episode that looked as if the good guy dies but miraculously survives when the next episode began but in this film it's much hokier and ridiculous you would literally see the hero die in the last episode but in the next they re shot the scene and showed he actually didn't die even though they clearly showed him buy the farm in the last one again and again in spy he seems to die but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and he somehow avoided death even if he fell 1500 feet into a river fell into a buzz saw or whatever br br watch this movie not for its quality but either for a good laugh or to learn what it was like to go to the movies on saturday mornings decades ago
<START> it had potential it really did but there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable i'm a horror movie weenie and i thought it was stupid as did my 13 year old i was expecting to be at least creeped out and yes the gross factor of the vines squirming in the people was there however the lead up to getting to the ruins is just dumb dumb dumb br br i mean really who goes on a hike in a jungle with a total stranger with a little water and a few snacks in flip flops no less puh lease better still who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or being able to speak a bit of the language are these people complete morons br br the brother isn't heard from and he doesn't call for assistance who doesn't do that he just finds some greeks and americans to go on a little search and find
<START> the most amazing film i have ever seen i didn't read the programming and i just stumbled onto the movie by accident i thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what i saw i only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about punishment park in the u s it felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the us if you are from europe i must admit that i felt really anti american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way
<START> i watched the version with pathetic american over dubs maybe this made it much worse but from what i could make out the film was pretty bad anyway it seemed low budget the visuals reminded me of a second rate tv movie random white dog substituted for embarrassing 60's bbc costumes etc mainly though i feel like the characters in the movie did not behave anything like the characters in the comic and as a result i never felt willing to even try to forgive the poor look of the film it is always going to be hard to capture the feel of the comics in a film without using animation and i didn't feel this attempt was worth it ultimately
<START> i went to see suspecting i would hate it i did everything about it was wrong it was like they were filming a different book granted the locations and houses very lovely if not a little miscast yes even the house were wrong for their parts keira was too modern dull and frankly i found it unpleasant to watch her were everyone else sees darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate was stupid and dippy he isn't meant to be and the bennett's were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reason farmers this is incorrect and ludicrous the very idea that mr bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid they had servants mr collins was not repulsive and greasy merely stupid and obnoxious georgina darcy was ugly and old and miss wore a sleeveless dress what as if it is historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying i could go on for days i hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but i fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it the bbc version is so superior it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory in short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the bbc version other wise you will be lead done the deluded road that this is what it's like which its not
<START> the movie is about paul a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital and his friends victor viktor who during his education in england started to think he was adolf hitler peter who took to much lsd and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity he is with china beatle has spent most time at the hospital although viktor is slightly older then him he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by telepathy br br the novel is better then the movie and covers all of pauls life from birth to his death there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover pauls childhood br br is funny sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now and read the novel first it makes the movie better
<START> this is a silly movie with much singing and dancing acting is average but writing leaves something to be desired there are rememberable performances by buddy with a short but outstanding performance by gypsy rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy a totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating of alice in wonderland many parts are worth watching but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie
<START> we all know what chan wook park can do if you haven't seen oldboy or the sympathy trilogy for that matter you are missing out on some of the best films made this century but i'm not here to talk about them i'm here to talk about thirst br br this movie is not what you would expect yes it is a vampire movie but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl i wont get into the synopsis you can read that above but instead tell you what this movie has to offer chan wook park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception with some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene the movie does start a bit slow but i felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll thirst is predominantly a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing chan wook park is no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy the end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film i have seen br br overall this is an exceptional film that i feel all movie buffs should see it is an exciting and admittedly different take on the world of vampires and the romance is far from sappy or boring this movie is gritty selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways obviously it is not for everyone but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested see it do not hesitate
<START> odd but wonderfully original movie genuinely frightening creepy and ridiculous in equal measures the setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action the thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills the cast is fantastic tanya dempsey really gets to chew some scenery after being undervalued in other full moon films joe estevez proves why brother martin sheen is so much bigger in hollywood his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious charles band co produced with stuart gordon and this really is an exceptional full moon release danny also directed hell asylum with dempsey
<START> this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevsky's 'crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo if you are a conservative you will not like this movie br br besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of symbolism in representing the of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a 7
