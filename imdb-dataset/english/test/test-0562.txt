<START> not too bad entry in the series heavily with war propaganda but rathbone bruce's sincerity keep me happy br br it's a rather fantastic story from start to finish just how many are there holmes and moriarty independently reeling out the dancing men code so fast was amazing watson so why weren't you amazed the post explaining the bomb sight tickled me it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play once again reminding me that they didn't expect people to be critically watching this over 60 years later this and i think every other potboiler from universal at this period were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten they perhaps should have realised that basically people don't change that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now 2005 and tightened up on the script and sets br br lionel atwill was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time i wonder if it was that or particularly effective make up that made him look so haggard as moriarty br br the important thing about sw though is that this was the first holmes film roy william neill directed i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one thus establishing a marvellous ambient continuity
<START> this is a absolutely masterful stroke of genius by paul thomas anderson the writer director of this movie it really examines the pluses and minuses of the world of porn and consequences for your actions living in a world literally fueled by sex drugs and rock n' roll only of the finest casts assembled with mark wahlberg burt reynolds heather graham julianne moore william h macy philip seymour hoffman don cheadle philip baker hall and others
<START> my wife and kids was billed as the 00s very own cosby show but unlike the latter it was unfunny and unwatchable in fact it is so poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around michael mickey taking michael jr's dumbness and the fact that he is such a loser which got more and more tedious and annoying as the show went on br br what was supposed to have been a promising hit eventually turned into a dumb silly show later on where the ideas became so ott and ridiculous and as for the second claire i ended up disliking this character so much she became a spoilt childish and moaning teenage brat in most of the later episodes br br was no cosby show trend setter rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards
<START> this is a pretty faithful adaptation of novel black rain like the book it is very moving and thought provoking the story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married they are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness after walking through hiroshima on the day of the bombing well filmed well acted moving tragic horrifying and funny

<START> a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is then that's the only good thing about it the lovely ally sheedy couldn't stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcr's everywhere it should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by danny aiello's character were billed as themselves as well as the characters they played in his d rated film calling it a b rated film is too much of a compliment and would lead to delusions of grandeur
<START> this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making it's practically perfect in all of them Â a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces br br the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema i can think of no other film where something important occurs every other minute quite literally ji kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels a seemingly insignificant object may be shown Â a rack of dresses two diaries a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack a bottle of pills etc Â but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more Â a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid fire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of lest they miss something important in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable br br the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions he posits that ji kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that in reality however nothing could be further from the truth a tale of two sisters provides a series of objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention he would have noticed Â for example Â the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film these flashbacks convincingly contradict assertion of complete subjectivity the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them can ji kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film i think not br br please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot get a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture you need only put them together remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind Â he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that Â when completed Â an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe br br don't misunderstand me there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design spider forest 2004 perfect blue 1998 and donnie darko 2001 are perfect examples of this a tale of two sisters is not it's ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clichÃ© that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence i'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort he apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible this is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself just read the threads by within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious br br i'd like to say more but i've come to my 1 000 word limit all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said
<START> i have watched this movie at least 30 times maybe more and each time i watch it i am drawn into the movie and back to 1963 the movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time i watch it br br i think the important thing to say here is i was 15 in 1963 and i can remember before president kennedy was shot and before the beetles came i can feel myself saying something like i carried a watermelon and then realizing just how stupid that was jennifer grey plays frances baby houseman in dirty dancing baby is going to start college in the fall she goes to for vacation with her family mom dad and sister lisa br br one of the staff dancers penny played by cynthia rhodes gets pregnant by another staff person one of the college boys played by max cantor and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and johnny patrick swayze are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel br br thus the need for a fill in dancer for penny johnny is persuaded by penny and his cousin billy neal jones that he can teach baby to do the dance in time for the show baby learning the dance steps with penny and johnny are wonderful scenes br br baby's father doctor jake houseman played by jerry orbach comes to penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong dirty dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers around this time 1963 many girls actually died from this type of abortion but there were not many choices for a girl then br br lonnie price plays a great conceited grandson neil kellerman to jack weston's max kellerman jane does a great job as baby's annoying sister lisa houseman br br the music is great and the dancing is wonderful the dirty dancers are absolutely wonderful and very sexy i can feel baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says where'd they learn to do that br br jennifer grey and patrick swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles patrick's song she's like the wind brings tears to my eyes each time i hear watch it in this movie br br the movie ends on an up note but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in baby's and johnny's lives dirty dancing gives something new each time it is watched it mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again
<START> question how does a film merit two different titles like the librarians and strike force br br answer the film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title br br this film is a hodgepodge of martial arts death wish melodrama romance and other clichÃ© film techniques the story focuses on a vigilante group called the librarians led by agent simon william forsythe the group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious multi creature named marcos andrew divoff who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south florida br br burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest i have ever heard this may have been burt's attempt at an irish dialect but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in the godfather br br also appearing in this film is erika eleniak who has infiltrated the inner circle of bizarre world erika's character kick boxes her way into an alliance with simon the librarians and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv box
<START> director michael ritchie and actor robert redford's second documentary style drama 'the candidate' is a political satire that still seems fresh and pertinent today so it's a pity that made a short time before seems so dated by contrast the music is ugly and the perhaps innovative ski ing sequences are now standard in televisual coverage of the sport the world of ski ing seems strangely amateurish probably accurately given the time the movie was made but it's hard to relate to today's professional world and the theme of americans in europe likewise seems in an age of ever easier travel perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot centred on the arrogant but enigmatic hero unfortunately it's a dreary performance from redford offering us little insight into his cares or motivations and a character driven film without much of a character is never a good bet i expected much but sadly this is a boring movie
<START> academy awarding actor sidney poitier of lilies of the field reprises his role as lieutenant virgil from the 1967 oscar winning best picture in the heat of the night for veteran director gordon douglas' tired uninspired sequel they call me mister with nobody the equivalent of rod steiger with which to swap dialogue clearly both bullitt scenarist alan r and robert d webb of cape fear were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler the dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting not even the chief suspect absolutely nothing remotely exciting suspenseful or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit meanwhile things have changed considerably since virgil was last seen in in the heat of the night he worked as a homicide detective for the philadelphia pennsylvania police department in they call me mister our hero works for the san francisco police department moreover he has a wife valerie barbara of change of habit and a family a young rebellious son andy george spell of the naked kiss and a younger doting daughter ginger wanda spell of hickey and drives a medium blue mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he doesn't have as much time to spend with them literally there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery indeed the best thing about they call me mister is quincy jones' terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved br br everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute joy sturges linda towne of the adventurers being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant apartment handyman williamson hernandez of intruder in the dust enters apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead he picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports death to the superintendent of the apartment rice anthony of license to kill and gives and fistful of dollars and sends him packing afterward anonymously notifies the that popular minister logan sharpe martin landau of nevada smith beaten joy to death and was seem leaving apartment captain jeff corey of true grit assigns to handle the case it seems that both and sharpe have known each other for 18 years naturally wife valerie cannot believe that the well known politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime just to give the movie context it should be noted that when and the police study the crime scene they mention the word ' no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie br br questions whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp explains that he has no records on joy sturges because she was the apartment from another realty company visits the realty company and realtor woody garfield ed of jfk flees and drives off essentially doing an o j simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit when proves that woody didn't kill joy he allows him to leave with his disgruntled wife marge norma crane of penelope prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment br br tracks down handyman and clears him of the crime and then he goes after luckily for our hero catches the evil in the middle of a narcotics transaction one of henchmen assaults but dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after eventually he corners in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out guess who wins br br the scenes in the household are more interesting than his investigation andy runs rampant striking his sister and smoking in the garden our hero wants him to clean up his room when andy refuses pops him three times on the jaw these child scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970 at the end of the movie as if to solidify the family sequence is seen walking off with his wife and kids there is on confrontation between valerie and virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them br br director gordon douglas directs in competent fashion surprisingly for a film released in 1970 the filmmakers never play the race card in one scene when searches a billiards parlor owned by an african american we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds and leaves with him in tow br br altogether they call me mister is a poor follow up to in the heat of the night mind you poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance but everything looks prefabricated all of the sets look fake and there isn't much physical violence one underground parking lot shoot out that doesn't last long and a fight beyond jones' seminal jazz score the only it really doesn't qualify as a major surprise more like a convenient the ending donald the organization followed they call me mister as the second more action packed sequel
<START> in one of the more under seen films of the late 1980's at a time when oliver stone was riding high with platoon and wall street and before his opus born on the fourth of july he co scripted and directed this look at the world of radio specifically one radio host in the middle of texas this man is barry in a once in a career turn from eric bogosian who wrote the original play and also co wrote the script barry is like a mix of howard stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off he's got ideas on his mind opinions and he's not only un afraid to speak them but also to stand up against the phone callers the callers indeed are the driving force in the film as barry has to combat against the mindless the obscene the racist and the purely absent minded as this goes on he also has to contend with his boss alec baldwin and a hit or miss deal to go nationwide outside the confines of the southern way station he's in br br while after seeing the film i felt curious as to see how it would've been done on stage i'd imagine it was a one man show as bogosian has had several on the side the direction of the film is phenomenal stone has been known almost typecast as a director who loves quick cuts the limitless effects of montage and effects with the styles of camera work and other little tricks that give his films in the 90's a distinctive almost auteur look but in the 80's he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the film and wasn't as frenzied as the other films in order to add the proper intensity that is within the studio and head space of barry he and dp robert richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times gritty un sure and definitely on edge the scenes in the middle of the film when barry isn't in the studio are fairly standard but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best i've seen from the stone richardson combination br br and one cannot miscalculate the performance of bogosian who can be obnoxious offensive angered passive and everything that we love and hate in radio show hosts there is also a funny near distracting supporting role for michael wincott as kent michael joe who prank calls him one night and the next gets invited to the studio these scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer but it does get very much into the subculture head space of the 80's that barry is as intrigued as he is critical of the stoner may not 'get it' but as he says to him it's your show indeed it's hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk and there is a lot of it but it's never boring and like himself it's not easy to ignore and when bogosian goes into his climactic tirade on air with the background panning around in a continuous 360 spin it becomes intoxicating and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful br br stone has been synonymous as a filmmaker of hot button issues who takes on subjects that were or still are controversial and gives them a life force that isn't always great but is all his own here his skills and ambitions don't get in the way of it's boosted if anything making an extremely skilled vision of what is essentially a near one man show which in and of itself is already well written
<START> barry kane is an aircraft factory worker suddenly sabotage takes place at the factory and starts a fire his best friend is killed they accuse him of the deed but kane knows it was a man named fry who was there he becomes a fugitive and goes to find this man named fry he's helped by a kind blind man he lets his niece the billboard model patricia martin take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed they don't end up there for the woman doesn't believe barry and wants to take him to the police but soon he changes her mind about barry and they find out about another sabotage attempt that's going to take place soon there's a group of anti american fascists and frank fry is a member of that group saboteur 1942 is another example of the fact alfred hitchcock could not make a bad movie robert cummings plays barry kane and he's really good at that priscilla lane with her good looks plays pat martin also really good otto kruger makes a great main villain as the leader of the fascist group charles tobin norman lloyd still alive at 94 plays fry and makes a very believable crook vaughan glaser is the most sympathetic character as the blind man philip martin the dance hall sequence is fantastic and also the moments on the circus train in the end we're at the statue of liberty
<START> this is a stupid movie when i saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over i stayed to the bitter end to show fortitude i caught it again on television and it was much funnier still by no means a classic or even consistently hilarious but the family kinda grew on me i love jessica anyway if you've nothing better to do and it's free on t v you could do worse
<START> this episode had potential the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment but a phone that constantly rings is somewhat interesting and when she explores the noise there is genuine tension and fear but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had br br first of all the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction e g it's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago the door opened by itself without me touching it etc given these supernatural phenomena plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room wouldn't she take some before entering it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the lights also while in the haunted apartment she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide just unplug the phone the phone company doesn't need to be involved walk up to the phone and unplug it case closed br br finally showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony brave little toaster anyone
