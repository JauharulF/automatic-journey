<START> i saw this film many years ago along with another of films wings as part of a soviet film series at a local film archive but none of films as far as i can tell have ever made it to video or dvd in the united states ascent is a great film by any standard with stunning black and white photography hypnotic direction and actors so deep into their roles that you have no sense of them merely giving a performance although the period details of russian resistance to and collaboration with german occupation are very telling the story is timeless two russian partisans are captured by the germans and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage i suspect the reason why it has not been released on dvd by the russians here comes the spoiler is that the jewish intellectual and not the tough russian peasant is the partisan who resists both threats and temptation goes serenely to his death and sets an heroic example for the villagers
<START> this is complete crap do not watch the main character is so f u c king concerned that the doc's bomb shelter is not big enough for everyone thus he claims the doc is playing god by saying who lives and who dies all during his he kills people without thinking twice and beats people to near death also the main character is an selfish little a wipe as because of him the doc who made the shelter died and his friend died he also killed several no name cops the main character is just a f u c king dumb hillbilly s h i t head that's got no concept of the greater good also this movie makes no f u c king sense tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity if you say gravity i will f u c king rape you cause the comet is smaller then the moon and you don't see the moon causing volcano eruptions and earthquakes and avalanches br br why does a comet cause atmospheric discharges the red lightning also why is it red in addition if you don't know the f u c king moons been hit by thousands of times thats why there's f u c king everywhere on the moon the size of an object needed to shatter the moon into the fragments as portrayed in the movie would require a comet around the size of the moon itself br br it takes huge amounts of ke to cause an satellite to explode like that br br a goof in this movie is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a disk shaped shock wave this is incorrect as in space the explosion should have produced an shock wave this inaccuracy is also apparent when the comet hits the moon br br also someone tell me why the commander the person who drives the big old broken plane suddenly felt the need to die i mean he's just like walking with them to the shelter then he stops he salutes the main character br br wtf the main character is also an ugly hole he's got a huge forehead and thinning hair disgusting br br stay away from this movie

<START> the genius that is stephen sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 musical thriller sweeney todd a gothic gory grisly yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to london to exact revenge on the evil judge who not only had him permanently exiled from london but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to shield her from all the evils of the world the barber finds love sympathy and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where todd is concerned this musical rocked broadway and won nine tony awards including best musical and best actress in a musical angela lansbury the production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with angela lansbury recreating her broadway role as mrs lovett the daffy pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads that todd makes mincemeat out of george who replaced len on broadway is electrifying in the title role so much so that you have to wonder why he wasn't originally cast in the role lansbury and are riveting from start to finish and commit 100 to their ghoulish characters aided by a first rate score probably the closest thing sondheim has written to an opera lansbury shines on the worst pies in london and by the sea george stops the show with epiphany and is also compelling during pretty women a duet he sings with judge turpin the man he has sworn revenge on cris is vocally impressive as antony the young who rescues todd and falls for his daughter johanna betsy is a little over the top as johanna and really pushes vocally to the point that during green and bird she actually drives her voice off pitch during a couple of moments the rest of the cast is first rate especially edmund as judge turpin who gets to perform johanna in this production which was cut from the original production and ken jennings as toby whose gorgeous tenor fills the auditorium on not while i'm around but it is breathtaking musical score by stephen sondheim and the mesmerizing performance by lansbury an especially george that makes this night of gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain call not for all tastes but if you're game and have strong heart sweeney todd is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of stephen sondheim and angela lansbury
<START> like all good art this movie could mean different things to different people to me it means that failing to open your hart to the others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty live the convenience of the selfishness is like the junk food it feels good but eventually could make you sick br br almost everything i see in the us is a commercial mass production of action garbage shallow dramas and stupid comedies and this sensitive deep and poetic movie really touched me thank you bilge and all the other in the cast br br ivan
<START> it was 1983 and i was 13 i watched valley girl on hbo one night when my parents were working after it ended i wanted to talk with someone about it immediately turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it we woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically we began to worship the main character julie played by the beautiful deborah foreman i am not saying this is a great classic although it is for me personally and i understand that the whole valley girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's but deep down at the heart of the movie it is a love story and a familiar but good one girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides an instant connection julie's friends don't like him he doesn't fit in doesn't go to their school doesn't have money they like her better with her ex boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk she makes the ultimate sacrifice her own happiness for her friends' happiness and she has these really cool supportive hippie parents it is one of nicholas cage's first movies and his first starring role one minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic his friend fred is pretty funny too if you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories it is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites probably in my top 10 i am eagerly awaiting it's release on dvd if they ever release it you can go to deborah foreman's website to sign a petition to get it released on dvd and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music
<START> based on the true story of two young americans who sold national secrets to the soviet union in the height of the cold war falcon and the snowman wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical and winds up falling short in both departments it's less le carrÃ© than who cares br br timothy hutton stars as christopher boyce a former seminarian who disgusted by watergate and the middle class values around him is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites for the cia sean penn plays his drug dealing pal lee who makes himself courier delivering secret files to the soviet embassy in mexico city an offbeat synth jazz score lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to what could have a decent moral dilemma thriller br br it's really penn's movie despite the second billing his character gets to talk turkey with the russians while hutton plays with his pet falcon hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called action with penn it's a whether you get a brilliant performance or an over the top one here it's a bit of both but more the latter especially in the second half when lee switches from coke to heroin he screeches he snorts he crashes russian embassy parties he gets pummeled with telephone books he spits at himself in a mirror a big he must have been saving for a paparazzi i don't know who my friends are anymore he cries out it's exhausting to just watch him br br penn seems to have modeled lee somewhat on dustin hoffman's ratso rizzo from midnight cowboy complete with overly nasal line readings and constant eye shifting john schlesinger directed this film as well as midnight cowboy but he seems to have had another hoffman film in mind the graduate throwing up scene after scene of boyce and lee poolside trying to decide how to live their lives in their gilded cage too bad no one suggested plastics br br from the opening shots news footage of american decline juxtaposed with boyce and his bird falcon makes clear it is a message movie though the message itself is far from clear probably because the characters never come into focus is boyce supposed to be an idealist or is he just a mercenary hutton and schlesinger don't seem to know which makes it harder for us meanwhile opportunities to establish some suspense like boyce stealing documents from the top secret black vault where he works or lee playing games with the russians are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends it's the normalcy of the story that schlesinger finds interesting but it's the least interesting aspect for us br br good stuff it's interesting to see a film that works the 1970s vibe so early as this one referencing maria muldaur and tang dorian harewood memorable in full metal jacket has a nice turn as paranoid colleague gene who shows boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder but has some serious 'nam issues beneath his partying exterior macon is also fine in a totally different way as the no nonsense boss who gives boyce his high security job david suchet as the russian embassy official who deals with lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and br br but falcon and the snowman stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters and neither the actors nor schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answers worse after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company you don't really want answers you just want those credits to roll
<START> a small town schoolteacher geena davis slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin soon there are men after her and a small time private detective samuel l jackson br br this was action packed with some great special effects and really funny one liners especially from jackson although the action may get a little silly at times who cares after all aren't movies meant to be a good time br br craig bierko is fun as a ruthless villain the movie itself was an all around good time just don't expect to have to think too much about it because then if you take it too seriously then the movie actually won't be fun but stupid instead br br this movie doesn't deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name
<START> this is a made for tv movie by hallmark hallmark has always made quality movies that are family orientated just desserts is a boy and girl fall in love while working together movie two bakers for a 250 000 prize against a field of professional bakers it is fun and light hearted the desserts look great the movie has a catchy upbeat little song played during the competition i assume that it is a made for the movie song by roger to bad that no soundtrack is available i would really like to get a copy of the song i don't even know the name of the song because the credits are squished at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos anyway the cast is great it is always nice to see brenda vaccaro she is very bubbly and upbeat lauren holly is always a plus and costas mandylor rounds out the good guys with a wonderful performance professional chef wolfgang puck has a guest appearance the movie is worth watching
<START> even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series its coming to dvd was a blessing for all time north and south truly is a series about friendship love honor you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series i can still remember the first time i caught a glimpse of this series on tv when i was about 8 years old i though wow this looks exciting to bad i never had the chance to see book one and two on tv in the netherlands when book three was broad casted as a late evening series in the netherlands in the summer of 2004 i just knew i had to see the other two series to most people book three was a big disappointment as far as i know well since i have seen book one on dvd i must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books to all youngsters who just watch the fancy movies like the patriot oh america for freedom there is a more realistic view to see for them here
<START> i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on a e i've been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid and love catching ghost hunters when it's on scifi channel i've tried to watch three episodes of paranormal state and only use up my time commenting on it because it's so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak paranormal state is beyond cheesy cheesy director's log voice overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be evil and the work of a demonic spirit then come the psychics like in poltergeist you almost expect the team to leave and say this house is clear i very much appreciate the ghost hunters approach where they go in to disprove claims then take away what they can and they are almost always reassuring to the client if they find anything that haunted does not equal evil paranormal state is not so bad it's good it's just plain bad didn't a e used to stand for arts entertainment the art part has long been gone and the entertainment factor is now waning as well
<START> the desperadoes 1943 is a genuine classic not for its story which is fairly routine but for its technical production elements this was a landmark western the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a columbia production a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation only fox's jesse james also starring randolph scott from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre although it would be eclipsed in a few years by the searchers and high noon the desperadoes was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure br br in 1863 the economy in the town of red valley utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the union army the script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad which was several years away in future and custer's last stand custer was busy fighting stuart in pennsylvania at the time but these are not important plot elements br br red valley has an honest sheriff steve scott but the banker and several citizens are corrupt robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses the town is visited by cheyenne rogers glenn ford a famous outlaw who is an old friend steve's he wants to go straight especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner alison mcleod evelyn keyes partner nitro rankin guinn big boy williams is mainly there for comic relief as are uncle willie mcleod edgar buchanan and the town judge raymond walburn who models his character on frank morgan's wizard of oz crystal ball faker br br taking no chances with their huge budget columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but indians and covered wagons there is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed a spectacular barroom brawl an explosive climax romance and three strip technicolor all this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943 unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy br br the cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming the indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences br br scott and claire trevor were top billed but the studio clearly wanted to promote ford who would soon be their biggest star and director charles vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife keyes whose portrayal of scarlett's sister in gone with the wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films br br the ford keyes dynamic is the desperadoes most unique and important feature rather than go for the clichÃ© love triangle with scott and or trevor which it first appears will happen the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors this was probably the best role keyes ever got and she makes the most of it playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses and who rides and fights like kiera knightley's character in pirates of the caribbean this was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the for wwii military service br br the desperadoes is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new unfortunately there are no special features on the dvd br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i first saw this movie on tv back in 1959 when i was eight years old i knew nothing of westerns then but recognized ben johnson from the movie mighty joe young what attracted me to wagon master were the great songs sung by the sons of the pioneers merian c cooper who produced the movie was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack cooper hired max steiner to create the mood for his classic creation king kong steiner would later win an oscar for the theme for gone with the wind ' cooper was also the producer of mighty joe young if you remember music was important to the big ape which would only respond to the sound of stephan foster's beautiful dreamer in 1947 cooper would partner with john ford who directed wagon master of all of ford's famous westerns this one is my favorite which features his brother francis and a sullen janes arness
<START> although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's others don't quite make it examples like his new job and come to mind and i would also the in this category br br charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store and vice versa this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects stolen by other costumers br br there aren't many laughs in it except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator for the rest quite disappointing br br 4 10
<START> also titled the magical castle this one is a stretch why bother why create another and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake only some girlfriend of the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters not voices remain stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread next thing you know some bird will have memorized the forbidden arts and swan princess 4 the magical bird will be born thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close
