<START> at the least some of the sitcoms that churn endlessly out of the us are honestly bad this junk however portrays a heart warming side to a clothes horse acting laughably learnt with glances and phrases delivered in the i'm so important and thin and beautiful fashion in the episode i just sat through someone's job was at risk simply because a colleague had placed a phone call her capabilities off really this is the lowest of the low what kind of damage does this foist on the watching masses seeing only glitzy glam puss people parading around working utterly sick making when the titles rolled i thought oh well it provided jobs for the boys you know who you are
<START> i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential but nothing more because boy did the filmmakers botch it the plot is practically incomprehensible the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic and what the hell is a trade rat worst of all though this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate the only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark haired woman well the blond girl was pretty too but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette anyhoo as with a lot of movies this is one to be seen only on mst3k
<START> dallas stars gary cooper ruth roman steve cochran barbara payton raymond massey it's directed by stuart heisler photography is from ernest pen duties fell to john twist produced out of warner brothers dallas is vividly filmed in technicolor out of the warner ranches in california very much a film with its tongue firmly in cheek the film is a throwback to the westerns of yore that exist without pretensions or deep meanings br br the plot sees cooper's civil war renegade reb hollister fake his own death so as to kill off his reputation and to free himself for the pursuit into dallas of the brothers who massacred his family in essence a routine plot story is perked up along the way by many a fun and exciting diversion there's role reversals dandy fashions horseback pursuits shoot outs a love triangle vigorous dialogue and deft little twists to keep the piece purely from painting it by numbers br br cooper seems to be enjoying himself too which further enhances the feel good factor on offer it's true he isn't really asked to do anything more than be a laconic dude on a mission but when called on for action duties he delivers the goods that his fans have come to expect during his successful career the villains entertain particularly steve vile and dopey bryant marlow because each have their own little peccadilloes to keep them from over familiar blandness the two ladies of the piece look gorgeous and hold up well in amongst the machismo while the high production value allows to really treat the eyes with the lush technicolor and involving camera work around the locations br br it has ideals to being an a list oater does dallas something it just can't quite attain but it's not for lack of trying and the end result is one of pure entertainment that in truth should be enjoyed on a cold winters day when the viewer needs a pick me up 7 10
<START> before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille ball's life really was it had it's great moments too but i didn't realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it
<START> rating 1 2 out of br br the net is one of those films that won't remain in your mind till the next one hour well just if you keep thinking how bad it is it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage one of those adjectives i've just used above is the reason which made me add 1 2 a star to the one i would have given so is it a case of 'so bad it is good' no it's a case of 'so bad it is br br bullock in a surprise very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time she works at home doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her suddenly she sees herself involved in dangerous situations after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her her identity bank accounts etc etc etc are all deleted and she is now ruth marx the conspiracy involves even the government and wait haven't we seen this before yes thousands of times the net tries to be modern to be the portrait of the '90s showing the computer as a villain big deal it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes take the scene of the boat accident i just laughed when the camera started to get slow br br what makes everything even worse here is sandra bullock how awful she is has she already made a decent film a time to kill okay but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures br br the vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in 2001 a space odyssey the best most intelligent and most complex film ever made it's not needed to compare the net with it is it br br the only reason to see the net is to laugh as i've said and to see what it tried to be the results well are a shame br br delete this film from your mind
<START> oh boy it's another comet hitting the earth film coming within a year or two of deep impact armageddon space cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them you'd think people would be burned out on this concept apparently not since i rented it hoping it might not be awful dennis hopper was in it after all and he's a good actor right br br i forgot something important along with peter o'toole robert de niro and quite a few other esteemed actors hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films not only that but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget how to act classes his performance in is so awful that you expect divine or edith massey to appear in some scenes br br i don't know what else to say about this rubbish other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films watch deep impact and then armageddon and space cowboys at a stretch forget the others altogether this one really is bottom of the pile
<START> sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea gone very very wrong as far as horror movies go and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment a film based around a bunch of teens attending a mysterious freak show is something you could have a lot of fun with br br however the writer decided to make a very straight very boring very plain tale about five teens who become part of the show when enraged midget abbot graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that mutates them into beasts br br the five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left his 'punishment' being that he is unable to join his friends and thus 'be alone' what a load of rubbish br br the 'actors' are really poor this film has no comedy and it could have been so funny no gore and it could have been so gory no action and no horror and it could have had so much of both br br the director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little interesting to watch his experience in soft core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had as all the shots are the same with very few edits and little movement the quality overall is poor br br i'm not usually swayed by nudity in movies but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts
<START> this film is brilliant it has cute little dolphins in it and its a great storyline and it has elijah wood in it which makes it a great film too his acting skills are very good and if you want a good soft family film this is the one to watch
<START> i've seen several of these body snatcher type movies but none was nearly as bad as this one br br no thrill no fx bad acting bad photography bad sound bad everything br br blue jello all
<START> calling all d grab your friends hit the theater and see the hell out of this movie from the opening sequence until after the credits you'll be laughing your self breathless br br this movie is a wild ride through the history of the d and not just some bull crap list of the things they've done but a chronicling of their rise to power i am a huge fan of rage kage kyle gass and jack black so naturally i loved the movie br br it helps to know about the show they had and their first cd but it's just as funny if you don't from the hilarious and vulgar lyrics the rocking rhythms the massive amount of pot smoking and the cameos down to the outright insanity that is the story line this is a movie for d and newbies alike br br many of their songs are referenced such as two kings tribute and to their many audio tracks like cock push ups every fan in the audience will be saying i remember that as well as new comers saying that's f'ing hilarious i highly recommend this movie to any body that's ever rocked out this movie is certainly in high competition for being the next this is spinal tap one of the best ever
<START> mediocre at best slow but probably more entertaining to the younger viewers a young boy chris miller is haunted by an indian spirit and horrid monster in the cellar of his father's new home also in the cast are patrick kilpatrick suzanne and ford
<START> just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini series published in 1981 it was not available on dvd until the last few years since then it has become available but initially only in the british format for which i bought an dvd player which you have to hack illegally i suspect to see it but the series is now available through amazon com 3 discs for between 19 21 to be viewed on dvd in the us format no hacking there were 41 reviews average 5 stars this mini series is one of the very best on oppenheimer or the manhattan project or virtually anything produced by the bbc
<START> there i am sitting at home in the morning suddenly my brother flips on what appears to be the stupidest looking movie i have ever seen considering it was the 70's and special effects weren't to sharpe this movie just about equaled the definition of crap the stupid monsters the stupid story line and the stupid setting made this the worst movie i have ever seen so bad in fact i didnt even finish it i made it up to a certain point then proceeded to see how long i could go without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself im just kidding haha awful movie
<START> a lot has already been written about the film itself so instead of adding to the noise i just want to say a few words on the two female actors br br it has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star in a sense versus the spectacular monica bellucci but pulls it off to sensational ends a film starring monica bellucci where i fall in love with the other girl that's not supposed to happen br br it's been said a thousand times but monica bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema i have never before seen such innate sadness she would not be out of place breaking lon chaney's heart
<START> is this a good movie no certainly not but for jolie lovers it's must have her non polished acting and semi nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come the current rating however 3 2 is too low the movie might lack a good storyline and isn't a great sf movie altogether but the acting is good enough and like mentioned before jolie's acting is nice and raw the movie is shot very direct with a lot of close ups the scenery is bizarre and last but not least leaving van damme out was a very good choice presumably non of the jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him this movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie
