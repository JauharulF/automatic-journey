<START> a lot of people give this movie a lot of crap and all of it's really undeserved people give this movie a hard time either because it's such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it if just by looking at the cover you think this movie will make you uncomfortable don't watch it however you'd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990's despite what anyone else says br br dee snider is wonderful here as captain howdy the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go the acting here is wonderful the film itself beautifully shot the subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow but it's still well worth your time if you haven't seen this movie check it out
<START> what could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director there were so many directions that the movie could have taken a vampire slash fest was not one of these the last 45 mins or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time and sex machine you gotta be kidding me the acting talents of the likes of juliette lewis and harvey keitel not to mention george clooney are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie br br the director robert rodriguez known for his other gory flicks including el mariachi desperado once upon a time in mexico and the very recent sin city really holds your attention with the well executed first half which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time but then apparently for no reason and without any provocation the madness starts there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy truly exasperating
<START> ahh nuthin' like cheesy semi porn masquerading as horror this one stars lovell sometimes sara st james the nubile starlet also seen in the erotic house of wax and that family favorite nude bowling party she is now a fixture in surrender cinema's line up of talentless cuties starring in pointless soft porn exploitation flicks head of the family actually tries to be a real moovie a con man and a tramp try to get said husband off ed they turn to a large brained evil genius in a wheelchair and his family of moronic misfits who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his nefarious bidding said genius has a giant head hence the clever title of the film that's about the extent of the film's humor but basically it's an excuse to show off the ample talents of lovell and dianne laced with some of the dialogue can be herd what the heck is plowing oats and just plain stupid this titular thriller will moost appeal to the breast of drive in theater but no one else the moocow says avoid the devoid unless yer looking for a rent on cheesy t a horror night 8p
<START> hi being able to speak cantonese i found this very funny and was able to all the jokes that one might not get due to language barriers the fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie however i have my criticisms first of all i find that it is not as good as the first one project a go and see that now reason is spoilers ahead don't read on if you haven't seen the film because in project a jackie ends by fighting his enemy the man he is sent to kill that is what he has been striving to do all the film and the showdown is spectacular but in a ii hough he fights chan the showdown scene between jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and the bulk of the action is against the men they are not nearly as bad enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to jackie so though their fight sequence is spectacular they are not the ones jackie is hunting throughout the whole of the film so thus leaving the viewer slightly unfulfilled however this is just my humble opinion so don't take it word for word go and see it yourself it is a great film in it's own right take care and hope your admiration for jackie grows yours sincerely ian ps you know the police chief in a ii he's the same guy in first strike nice to know he's still going strong
<START> although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it accomplishes in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90 br br it is the story of two brothers one 18 and the other 10 they come from a poor farm family in mississippi both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of family br br it brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind br br i can fully recommend this film as beyond superb
<START> it was inferred by a previous poster that the military would not be subordinate to the police in a disaster as depicted in the film in fact the military role would be to supply aid to the civil authorities when requested to do so the civil authorities would retain in practise the army would need 48 hours or so to mobilise themselves there not being much army presence in london especially with current overseas commitments even then they would be dependent on calling in the ta br br as for cobra we were given the impression that it was a full governmental emergency department in its own right even reference to a met police cobra division in fact cobra stands for cabinet office briefing room a it's just the room where the pm or meet their advisers to discuss the current emergency
<START> well this may be one of the worst movies ever but atleast there are some nice t ts in it the movie is a very bad spoof of the blair witch project and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t ts and no point other than to flaunt them
<START> an annoying and talentless american documentary maker learns of a legendary br br south african monster the half caste tradition says that it is a half human half leopard creature with the closest parallel being that of the werewolf of european tradition rather than focus on the creature the film follows the meanderings of the film crew there is little action or suspense until late in the film this problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating characters generating a ceaseless amount of even more irritating talk the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew br br perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of the blair witch project 1999 or the last broadcast 1998 regardless the film fails on most levels avoid at all costs
<START> i have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to together all the worst aspects of this kind of film you get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face while the characters are clichÃ©d spiritual guy leader with tragedy in recent past etc and the ending was just weak it really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere i have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah i imagine that caves are dark showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home i quite enjoyed the descent which for my money had better acting showed more tight caving situations better monsters and had a good ending br br spoiler br br the monster turns out to be some guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed leaving him to grow up in the caves he seems to have developed super strength and speed but why is never addressed maybe the same force that drained their torch batteries caused this but during the film whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something large with claws that tears up each victim see how much blood splatters the walls but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask i would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case then he starts raping the last remaining and roll credits almost absurdly bad i thought sometimes a film is soo bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh but this films fails to take itself lightly as well br br you watched it you can't unwatch it
<START> maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living however after watching this movie one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy bloated conceited paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break not exactly a pretty picture but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious noisy overacted action movie just what the doctor ordered right how many more of these movies has hollywood made one thousand two thousand the formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable the locales change but the plots remain the same and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo cartoon characters and act accordingly this movie seemed to run on interminably when will this movie end i repeatedly thought to myself leonardo dicaprio was totally unbelievable as a cia operative but what has to be one of the great of miscasting an overweight russell crowe plays a cia bureaucrat please note that in this movie the on site operative is lean and mean while his desk jockey supervisor is fat this is called stereotyping what was the casting director thinking why not have jack nicholson play an overweight office clerk or nicole kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman and the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility an obviously non arab american mr dicaprio trying to pass himself off as an arab speaking fluent arabic concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure trying to out think and real arabs who are completely by his laughable arab masquerade trying to romance a palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission etc by now you get the point next time try casting an actual arab in the role not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that there should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles next stop for this movie dvd land and oblivion and one other thing don t let this movie discourage you from working for the government the pay may not be great but the fringe benefits are excellent a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits
<START> martin first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer three years later to elia kazan's more conservative on the waterfront while waterfront benefited immensely from an electrifying marlon brando who inadvertently disguised kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify naming names as kazan did eagerly before the house un american activities committee edge of the city boasts a young john cassavetes and an upstart sidney poitier daring to confront issues that waterfront failed to acknowledge namely workers' rights and race relations br br edge of the city boldly dives into this then unknown territory and although the quite appealing black protagonist poitier may seem a bit hollywood simplistic the courageous struggle against thinly veiled bigotry and violence has hardly aged at all one wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of white black relations if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early they must of left dumbfounded if not offended br br the last reel of the film will still surprise audiences as it refuses to sink into expected clichÃ©s including those that tainted waterfront only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film edge of the city ends up being br br what's most disturbing about this lost classic how it sadly remains unavailable on any format for reasons that remain quite cloudy this film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country yet one can only find it on obscure late night tv if ever at all
<START> don't forget the lover on the side she is a karen parsons is delicious she is wonderful in acting and beauty and style it's just his job ho well now here is a show that the writing slugs you in the gut and while your doubled over kicks you in the butt in quoting peter's wife the associate writer producer she said when they were watching the for up coming 'new' shows at an abc network party she looked at her husband after the preview for 'the job' played and said this doesn't look like anything else that is on this network you guys are in trouble meaning it 'looks' very good but it's not looking like the regular happy people fare or over hair styled drama that they abc are regularly comfortable putting on the from the time i saw this after the first episode finished i made sure that i didn't miss that time slot next week i was instantly addicted to the job cutting wit and cynicism outrageous situations and laughter rolling writers makes this series a hit br br then i felt anger and a feeling of being let down that the show just sailed off the air i wondered what executive made that decision to tear down a major comedy cornerstone for their network br br i talked to other people about it some knowing some not but i know that the stupid network didn't promote this hard enough or i should say visually enough if they had it would have run at least 3 5 seasons maybe even six i just believe that knowing network short comings and being overly subscribing to one or another that they missed the boat with this one there was so much room for expansion it had barely just begun the situations were funny and serious fast and sometimes slow though not much it kept a good pace some years later i finally found it on dvd new for 50 00 to me it would be worth 1 000 00 to have this in my entertainment library i watched in amazement as i went through both seasons again for the third time on dvd and the ending episode was going into a total serious drama segment with them uncovering a murder victim it was better than most of the drama and 'cop' shows on the air now they went into the scenes as serious as a heart attack and as believable did so as if not even skipping a beat just like it was meant to be serious i am so impressed with the that and leary shared in the story lines and scripts br br in another outrage of the week' i learned that the beautiful wardrobe of silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra stylish footwear was all sold to the movie made for cable in the cut 2003 for only four hundred dollars thats it i'm sick did you see what they all wear for each show a good over coat alone could run that much br br this was denis leary at some of his finest i recommend this great cop for east coasters or wherever you are in this country i even heard that people from ireland were joking with leary the episode repeating lines back to him from that one because they saw it over there a superbly intuitive comedic new york leary cop show
<START> i just finishing watching goliath awaits that i ordered from my library i remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to watch it with my son anyway the movie was less than 2 hours running time and i thought it was much longer when i first saw it the back of the vhs box states that the goliath a nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever the divers were supposedly on a covert mission to retrieve the demonic document there was nothing even spoken about retrieving this document also the box says that the bestial ship's insatiable boiler feeds on human blood that would make this a horror movie and there was also nothing revealed in the movie about this i can't remember the details when i watched this years ago on tv but could the back of this box actually be true maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details br br just wondering if anyone knows anything about this
<START> i've been watching buffy the vampire slayer and really didn't begin to love the show until season 4 started this episode hush was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm the writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago amazing doesn't touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue if you've never given this show much thought at least watch this episode if this doesn't impress you then no episode probably will br br btw my heart is still racing
<START> seven months since a revelatory viewing of faces i finally found a rentable dvd copy of cassavetes' first feature shot on a shoestring in manhattan and in his acting workshop on ad hoc sets shadows was the culmination of months of improvisational rehearsals in which the mostly amateur actors developed bonds with one another invented their characters and polished their techniques to give their filmed performances just the right tenor of spontaneous familiarity this intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in e seymour cassel cramming his hands down lynn carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an as the actors' utter conviction here yields blisteringly honest moments like lelia and tony's post coital assessment of their relationship and ben's revulsion at a black woman's touch as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self loathing a homemade production in the best sense the out of sync dubbing and sound recording and the cinematography and up close camera setups build an immersive atmosphere that perfectly suits cassavetes' nuanced vision of human relationships as perpetual works in progress marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful attempts at communication and understanding charles largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living by the moment a mantra by which cassavetes worked and seemingly lived
