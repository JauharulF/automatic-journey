<START> i gave this film my rare 10 stars br br when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off i am very glad i didn't br br this is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of rachel nanny crosby a strong beautiful inside and out black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of lackawanna br br highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950's prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community br br in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era
<START> i saw this movie when i was very young living in houston texas i really enjoyed this movie and i wrote to jean peters in hollywood and i told her how much i enjoyed seeing her in this movie she sent me an autographed photo this movie was directed by jacques tourneur and besides jean peters in the starring role it also stars louis debra paget and herbert marshall it was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long jean peters was married to howard hughes she also starred in viva zapata with marlon brando anthony quinn who won an oscar for playing the role brother marlon brando starred as zapata 1952 and she also starred in captain from 1947 with tyron power since then i've been trying to find a place where it is available but so far i have not been successful does anybody have any suggestions about where i can find and purchase this movie it this comment contains spoilers i am unaware of it
<START> i went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released i was 11 at the time i remember how much i enjoyed it and wanted to live in shangri la that's how naive and young i was i recently came across a video of the film i had recorded off television some years ago i watched it again and am not ashamed to admit i still enjoy it as much now as i did 29 years ago i also enjoy listening to the words of the songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns don't pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection we should be happy with what we see this is what i call a feel good film because i feel happy after watching it maybe i am still naive but it makes me happy and i'm sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is a good family film i must be one of the few people who has this film on vhs pal video and dvd self made i recorded it on dvd as the videotape recording from tv was starting to wear thin i still watch it from time to time
<START> a teen age boy who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot takes off for a foreign country to rescue his dad if this is not ridiculous enough he talks a colonel in the air force into helping him get his hands on a jet wow to make the picture even more absurd the colonel risks his career and life by giving the spunky lad some hands on aid they not only don't make like this anymore but they never did this sappy corny film should be tossed into the air and blown away by a
<START> even before this film it is clear to see that ali g has become the exact character he set out to parody i am not a fan of sacha baron cohen's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke br br a paper thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and i must admit i did cringe when i saw such respected thespians as charles dance and michael stoop so low for employment saying that i must admit even if i am quite ashamed to that i did raise a titter on more than one occasion and however bad this film was it was never boring and never once did i consider switching it off mainly due to the gorgeous saying that only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious
<START> oh man talk about the effect of advertising apparently all that you have to do to enjoy box office succes is title your movie after a revered 19th century novel horrendous acting directing and cinematography in this sham of an effort
<START> king angus scrimm of romania is a vampire but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind but his son anders is a cruel creature to his very heart which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him three female students have come to study local folklore but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time has been killed br br who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from angus scrimm i can't i mean i had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures puppet master in particular and demonic toys but despite the really bad animated effects of the demons this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch plenty of blood a good plot and backstory the story was surprisingly refreshing and even some new angles on the vampire mythos which you'd think would be dead by now maybe i'm wrong but this is probably the first film to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun aside from vampires and blood you get a share of nudity gratuitous but welcome and i had to notice the excellent score from the composers not sure who deserves credit but those involved include stuart richard william levine michael and john this is horror 101 all the way heck you even get two sequels which is the sign of a true horror film of course some bad films get sequels too did i mention puppet master the romanian theme was well done and the film even seems to have been made by romanians if i am guessing their name origins correctly and the score the music really stood out for me as a nice change of pace very mood setting i like richard band but i'm glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head if you like vampire films and want a slight variation one of the eastern european variety this is worth seeing
<START> some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote i've seen both of those as well as chop shop and like in many instances i don't feel the comparison is warranted city of god and pixote surely had a much higher budget chop shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope disappointment and continuing with life one of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the us open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the us open footage was added i say that because i live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the tennis matches are in progress it's also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their character's names in the movie back to the movie it's an enjoyable story about survival however it ended up getting a 7 because at times the actors acted extremely well at other times they appeared to be just reciting their lines if the actors were less competent as they were in the low budget the big dis for example i would have been more forgiving but in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances at other times they appeared bored the director might be at fault here i also had problems with the ending this is one of those movies that just ends maybe there will be a part 2 definitely worth getting on dvd i wont bother summing up the story because that info is already available on imdb
<START> as an english teacher i appreciate films that do more than tell a story good films like good literature cause one to think reflect and predict this film made me do all three mr jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters i also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film their choices do not seem as adolescent or as other films i have seen the acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other excellent soundtrack with songs you don't hear on the radio it is a reconciling with life spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance
<START> i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams but when i saw it i realized i had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy although it has a few really good laughs in it it felt like i was watching two movies one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle i really don't know how to classify this film but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh not as much as i had hoped but at least williams is back in the right direction see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense
<START> marco costas mandylor was born into a baking family in the bronx although the have been well known for their confections over the decades the business has fallen on hard times meanwhile grace carpenter lauren holly is a most talented dessert maker in manhattan but she can not seem to land a prime position because of the glass ceiling an accidental meeting between marco and grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both there is a high profile bake off the golden whisk taking place in the near future and marco wants grace to partner with him there is a hefty amount of dough haha at stake for the winners enough to set grace up in her own business and save the eatery too reluctantly grace agrees but there are complications some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both grace and marco then too although marco and grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other grace has a long standing very rich boyfriend can marco and grace win the contest this is a lovely film for the romantic at heart first there is the nice cast holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions in this film she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful grace mandylor a newcomer delights too as the good looking rival baker the rest of the actors including the wonderful brenda vaccaro as mother is quite nice as a hallmark movie the costumes sets and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny despite some familiar themes treat yourself romcom lovers to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film it is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates
<START> i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating it's a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomery's mission places him in some very improbable situations and he's just the man for the job he maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precocious eccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddly br br among the glut of b movies from the late 1940's and 1950's once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for
<START> i was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when i first saw it i was only mildly amused i must say however that i am still very disappointed that donald o'connor wasn't given a bigger and better role he was an enormous talent br br there is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and matthau has never been funnier br br i am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see lemmon and matthau team up for the very last time in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use brent spiner proves that data from star trek the next is not the only good character he can play br br the storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and i laughed heartily throughout this movie and i highly recommend it
<START> many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today soon u will know someone in the house has died the dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple one of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile daughter is busy with her makeup her mother suggests her to wear but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over another son asks her mom to finish all the and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind revealing the face its anupam kher suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed is it his dream or a flash back u won't get an answer until the end of the movie well this is wat comedy is for the director later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream is this a film comedy well it is supposed to belong to that category but it actually does not there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police so everyone must cheat the cheats or forget about justice music by is ok nothing much to tell about other sectors bad script destroys everything not even anupam performance succeeds in making it at least a
<START> mr bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour it is the most shallow humour tv series ever made in history the scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine mr bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is it is incredible that such a tv series of low quality can be sustained for 5 years it is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one can't help but to express disgust and pity why rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2 dimensional unfunny and ridiculous character or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode watching this is an aggravating experience
