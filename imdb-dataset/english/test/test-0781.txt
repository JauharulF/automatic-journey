<START> i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clichÃ©s but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it i couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also is pretty passÃ© i couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally
<START> this movie really is that bad and i'm normally a sucker for bad movies but this was too much seeing this is like on pure suck now you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel you may have waded through every title from full moon and troma all the movies of edward d wood jr uwe boll albert pyun and direct to dvd flicks from faded men of action you may even have seen death tunnel ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst3k covered but in their original form but you do not know truly awful film making until you have seen darkhunters and if you haven't you shouldn't don't bother not only is this movie amazingly poorly written directed shot edited acted and splattered in crude cheap aftereffects first of all it's a pretentious mess but not good greenaway or lynch style pretentious or hilariously messy in an ittenbach or early waters sort of fashion it's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart sort of like m night sp only that man seems like a freakin' messiah when compared to this trainwreck and this coming from a rampant hater it's also boring not heavy going type boring which is okay if the movie awards your patience darkhunters does no such thing it's boring in a oh my fu king god if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu king kill myself kind of way br br btw anyone who claims to like this film is a liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed
<START> director lead larry bishop tried way way too hard with hell ride the movie wants to be edgy witty provocative outlandish biting all of this seemingly in a quentin tarantino rob zombie style but it's not edgy the references seem forced the dialog tries to be clever and fails the humor is never funny nice try setting a gritty tone but we'd have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed br br what you're left with are cool harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired old and out of shape bad boys in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized sergio leone western if this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films kudos for it but on its own it is rather boring and irrelevant i do believe there is a place for style over substance but this movie is not it
<START> random hearts is a very well directed well scripted and perfectly cast actors for the primary roles i found it to be so intense that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene harrison and kristin are together how their characters deal with this horrible situation they find themselves in very talented acting from both of them a lot of people i believe who did not appreciate the movie for what it was did not get the point of the movie or could not even fathom a situation like theirs br br please skip this next part if you have not seen the movie yet br br i loved the ending which was a great surprise which tied the whole movie it was relieving to see how these two good persons can come out actually happier in the end br br
<START> generally speaking i don't make negative comments on here but since this is a festival piece i don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again br br i thought the actors were pretty bad for instance they totally didn't play off each other rather they waited to recite their lines which were pretty poor to begin with the dialogue sounded really forced norman or whatever his name tried or so it would appear to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short br br after words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all yea and he all but called them liars look there were so many clues the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a 500 an hour whore i mean the john gave her at least tell tale sign now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred i for one didn't even care i was just glad to get out of there i asked him which draft he shot and he said 8 1 maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15 3 cause this needed a lot of work br br but he seemed like a fairly nice guy he is making his own films he'll probably get better and i hope he does not in a snotty way either i mean it i wish him luck just remember this is just my opinion
<START> very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins 1964 and bedknobs and broomsticks 1971 the human cast is very distinguished james mason billie whitelaw david tomlinson joan greenwood bernard cribbins but their roles range from the miscast a 69 year old mason as a thieving chimney sweep to the inconsequential greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat to the bizarre whitelaw plays several 'exotic' characters including a circus performer an old hag a maid and a fairy for no apparent reason br br the animated segment of the film handled by a group of east european animators is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and as usual with this type of thing there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed far more successfully other children's films namely the railway children 1970 and the amazing mr 1972 which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk
<START> this movie received a great write up in blockbusters 'coming i was looking forward to the release date 08 07 02 the plot sounds reasonable the cast alone should have guaranteed a side splitter but whoa there apart from the 'off the wall betting this was quite a bore br br this will never become a comedy classic and i'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of john cleese rowan atkinson now he was quite funny in a rowan atkinson sort of way
<START> i saw this film when it first came out in the cinema we were all looking forward to seeing mark hamill relaunch his career but we came out wishing we hadn't bothered many people walked out after about half an hour i wish i had too the basic premise seems okay but the plot was ridiculously involved and tortuous and runs out half way through its completely unmemorable and not a film you want to have paid money to see if you're really bored and it's on tv then it'll help you kill a couple of hours or help you to nod off 2 10
<START> for many years ed wood's classic 'plan 9' has been considered the worst film ever made forget it the roller blade seven is infinitely worse the cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses the plot along with the budget and script are non existent the running time is made up not in the classic ed wood style of using stock footage instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action and as for the roller blade seven aren't even seven of them br br you must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be giving independent film makers everywhere hope
<START> i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy stereotyped characters over acting their way through a cops and robbers farce but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest michelle pfeiffer is adorable but the person really carrying the film is dean stockwell who steals every scene as the head mobster named tony no less br br performance is the reason i'm writing this review and the only reason i'd recommend it in fact you'll be tickled by his screen time he's plays the mob boss perfectly with comedic touches in the right places managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche in fact a complete delight to watch a master of the take ' and a real in those classy suits and fedoras br br says a good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers
<START> this owes a great deal to the plot of captains courageous although he is quite grown up it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father when the cargo burns she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship however the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where moran is concerned the inevitable ensues our lad falls for the moran and she for him in the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united some interesting dialogue points out that moran belongs to no man and no woman a nod to sappho here dorothy dalton is appropriately sexless as moran and not too attractive either valentino does well in a romantic action role his sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one he is very appealing this is no great film but it passes the time what it really showcases is beauty and sexiness
<START> imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school and meeting new people or yet it's your first time where you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is somebody from camp meatballs packs lots of comedy in this film in camp there's a eccentric counselor bill murray who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time enter a kid named rudy chris makepeace who has no one to look up to he doesn't fit in with anyone only can make him have fun the rest of the can are just as crazy as camp is an average camp with an above average team one the other hand camp mohawk is an elite camp that has them running for their money in the basketball game the got and in the olympiad the teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members take out the saboteur and morty harvey this poor soul can never get himself in gear if he tried a very very funny comedy and it's a big keeper i'll say this movie shows that camp can be fun if you wanted to be 5 stars
<START> excellent performance by mary kay place steve jacqueline bissett and johnson superb story that reels you into the movie emotional yet light hearted i own this movie and everyone that i've shared it with loves it great for mixed company 18 crowd br br nice production not a cheap budget well organized and keeps your interest uses dome newer ideas for flashbacks and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat br br no matter what walk of life a viewer is from they will buy in to one or more viewpoints in this film br br would love to see a sequel
<START> didn't really know what to expect from this movie and found myself being pleasantly surprised i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in br br i'm not big into hustler movies or con movies but i have to say this one roped me in within minutes probably because i couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who this movie is stylish and fast paced with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances br br while i was impressed with most in the film i must say was simply excellent br br give it a chance it's a really fun film
<START> mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera br br the acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas i guess the writer and director has seen too many mexican soap operas and can't conceive anything remotely different br br give it up go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please br br stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable mexican film industry br br it is not an ok or good movie it's a mediocre soap opera
