<START> having previously seen this short on vhs tape with the feature summer stock i just rewatched every sunday on the tcm site it marked the film debut of 15 year old deanna durbin and of 14 year old judy garland outside of her two older sisters these two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from deanna of il bacio then one from judy of waltz with a swing before the two climax with americana the slight plot of this 11 minute film concerns the possible unemployment of durbin's real first name which is the way she's addressed here grandfather's conducting job at the park because of low attendance with the two girls' help you can probably guess what happens from there contrasts are marked not only with garland's and durbin's musical choice but also with their height poise and movement despite all that they perform quite well at the end and it's almost surprising that m g m chose garland while durbin was already contracted at universal as this short was made but was briefly allowed back in since her feature debut three smart girls was in the early preparing stages judy herself would make her first feature parade at 20th century fox as m g m was deciding what movie she would next star in that would be broadway melody of 1938 where she would perform the show stopping number dear mr gable you made me love you but back to this short every sunday provides a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them
<START> apparently this was an award winner apparently someone had a gun against his her head and was force to nominate maize the movie br br or this must have been a mistake br br this is the most unwatchable movie ever made the screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask the little girls run into their hero dad and then runs away from him w t f the hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this br br the girls obviously weren't trained actors and had no common sense to them they were so annoying and so infantile in the movie it not even remotely comedic hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why i got up and left you can't even listen to this movie without nearly going into convulsions br br i can puke a better award winner than this garbage
<START> superb silent version of the story of francois although remade in the thirties as if i were king with frank lloyd directing preston sturges scripting and ronald colman starring this version is even better barrymore with a cohort of comedians plays the comic fool and the wine depressed with a verve that colman could not match the photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast particularly conrad veidt in his american premiere the incredibly beautiful day and the supporting comics slim summerville and hank mann steal every scene they are in br br it is a shame that barrymore did so few first rate comedies among his sound films only his lead in twentieth century and his supporting role in midnight can compare to this and those stand up only because of his superb voice in this silent movie barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words and he does so alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the king of the fools and tenderly as in love he even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of fairbanks most convincingly he also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era br br finally a brief word about alan a director known today only for directing the first talking feature the jazz singer in the same year this was released was a careful innovative delightfully original director and it is a shame that more of his works are not known perhaps this movie far more interesting as a movie than his best known work will be your introduction to his other talents if so you could do far worse
<START> i really enjoy this particular production of the the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences for instance as some day it may happen the little list song is completely updated and a few lines are ad libbed throughout the play liberties were also taken with the setting the costumes are not japanese but rather 1920s english although some of the girls wear '20s inspired this production is well choreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes as well as ears entertained during the songs if you're a gilbert sullivan purist these changes may bother you but i think they're fine and i love the costumes br br felicity palmer is absolutely hilarious all of her scenes make me laugh out loud one of my favorite add ons is when she first makes an entrance the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice stop it all of the other main characters do a fine job as well i particularly like mark richardson as pish tush that toupee and lesley garrett as yum yum br br you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly there is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest if there is one draw back to this production it is that the stage makeup wasn't modified for close up shots with a camera foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere i've seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and it's a little jarring at first however i hope you'll get used to it and enjoy the for what it's worth a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic
<START> this is a pretty silly film including what may well be the least erotic come on ever to make it to the big screen the heroine pours v 8 all over herself and invites the hero to lick it off yuck and yet it also features the resplendent lucinda dickey in what is far and away her most erotic performance in those long ago days women even action heroines with real muscles were a rarity and i can still remember the way my jaw dropped when dickey took off her shirt revealing the most powerfully built female back and biceps i'd ever seen dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film she could have been a female schwarzenegger if anybody had had the vision to promote her
<START> i have in the past loved tim burton i loved ed wood edward scissorhands and even mars attacks but i hate this movie the costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago then there were all the head cutting scenes which just left me cold and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something i would think yes there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless
<START> farscape is the best sci fi show period for one main reason everything the show attempts it does very well from a technical aspect the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show the special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv the acting is also great too many shows nowadays use only the american market of actors for their shows remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said wow where did that agent smith come from its the same feeling that you get watching claudia black anthony virginia hey and especially wayne these aussies are great and it comes through in this great show br br the plot is second to none the next closest thing i can think of is babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes but this tops even that its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed the overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining i am always itching for the next show br br the comedic episodes are funny the drama episodes are touching and the action sequences are tense the beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud something that rarely happens while watching television that is not south park or seinfeld the drama is even harder whether crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality all is done with heart and intensity lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops this is sci fi br br if you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest if you enjoy good television at all if you like good serialized plot you owe it to yourself to watch farscape br br oh and ben browder owns
<START> i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival in twelve brief but exquisite minutes leonard takes us on a life changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society the film embodies elegant direction moving performances and a heart rending story kelli garner and lucas haas radiate as the two lovers and in his first venture into dramatic narrative leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film it's difficult to describe talent but as this debut film demonstrates you know it when you see it
<START> beautifully filmed acclaimed director hugh hudson chariots of fire creates a story that brings the entire legend of john clayton lord greystoke and tarzan of the apes to life with reverence and dignity and with a scope not heretofore seen in tarzan films christopher lambert makes his starring debut as the young lord raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in africa later returned to what is to him an alien world that of class and privilege he feels totally out of place once he learns what has happened to the apes that raised him and their world he realizes that he must go back a sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas this is one of those films that is a must for every collection
<START> a terrific b feature a virtual two hander and set over the course of a day you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play and although only 77 minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home both are superb especially the under rated lupino whose initial independence and self control soon crumble before ryan's unhinged intruder today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner much better known as an art director only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock
<START> menace is not funny it tries hard too hard but rarely brings a smile there is no acting just mugging one of the main characters wears a stupid grimace on his face the entire movie no doubt as the less talented wayans brothers starred wrote and produced the film they were entirely blind to their lack of talent br br menace consists of a series of unfunny one joke skits the punchline can be seen a mile off but you have to wait until it all unfolds no zippy one liners or snappy dialogue here just one scene after another building up to the joke the jokes themselves are juvenile loc dog the one with the perma grimace talks to a beautiful woman but then she has bad breath and then she picks her nose and then wait for it remember you must always w a i t she farts how funny is that ten year old boys may find it funny as they won't have heard the jokes as many times before alternatively if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow along and may even find it amusing the challenge will be getting drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out
<START> not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger ball's performance was ok nothing really more than that she didn't blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what i'm accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line there's two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them i didn't find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent there's typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up it's just a question of how she's going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if you're not big on the genre this will be lacking i'm not big on the genre 3 10
<START> the film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement when seeing the events through the perspectives of politicians terrorists and of course victims in this smart drama lessons are given about contamination and surviving chaos while meantime the backstage look at the way crisis is managed prompts viewers to distrust guardians and to be scared by assailants the film originally aired on bbc gets to arouse effectively doubts on official performances are proper understated though never terrific the flick is just a beginning a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it gets to work in my opinion giving the right thrills and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself questions
<START> they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie that sounds about right br br this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i've seen gigli it's not as bad as gigli but that's like saying saddam hussein wasn't as bad as adolf hitler br br tom has been living in france with his french wife and 13 year old son he has been pretending to be french all this time he reveals to his wife that he is actually american for some reason this comes as an earth shattering reveal for her despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's american accent also their son remember he was born in france and never knew his father was american speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent that's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie br br the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to tommy's youth in new york city during the 1970's as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france his best friend as a boy was pappas a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams i assume duchovny thinks that retarded is someone who is just sort of dumb because pappas comes off only mildly slow at times while other times he comes off as just robin williams yes williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow br br tommy's mother played by duchovny's wife tea leoni is a pill popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband leoni does a good job but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at tommy for things that don't seem to be too important the script didn't give her much to work with tommy also befriends a lady whom he calls lady who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window this house of detention is called house of d for short thus the title tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice and he does so many times without care br br i don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as well bad real bad real real bad near the end of this train wreck the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending br br critics tore house of d apart and rightfully so i can't believe some people actually like this movie it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards not from emotion but from how terrible it was
<START> haggard the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend 1 a skate boarder who lives for nothing and 2 a trying to be funny scientist which doesn't really work played by bam and br br the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass etc but to say it was written by bam and co this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to br br the films also stars girlfriend jennifer who plays ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a k a hellboy played by which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring but worst of all is character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also i think he could have been improved overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character br br to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time br br towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon br br in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at things that aren't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music 7 10
