<START> it's as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film which is obviously far superior to this trash it's clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be mano a mano man against man instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes at this point in the film the characters just don't act like regular people and not even like their own personalities it makes little sense it's quite clear why this film flopped it's just not believable at all and that's too bad it started out with promise don't be fooled
<START> many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is one of them br br though billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multi michael has managed to weave elements of comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certain br br while the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david and natasha the delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through max's eyes and imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is expansive in scope requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of grace's deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and mania br br this is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so don't see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more dramedy than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as max's sister sis the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector ralf as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress even her character melts eventually as does everyone who is touched by max's literally undying love for grace br br can love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psyche br br seattle international film festival june 2005
<START> a beautiful reflection of life's desperation and misdirection of finding love tragic while at the same time absurdly entertaining most people do not give this film a chance ignorance just a mere reflection in itself until next time
<START> the emperor and the assassin w english subtitles at 161 minutes is long but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china's unifying king circa 300 an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast king simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled but not without treachery plots and counter plots and oh yes bodies lots of bodies this epic story of china's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history emperor include the thousands of life size terra cotta figures which are still being excavated today as an historical person this film makes it clear that emperor should be regarded along with george washington napoleon bonaparte alexander the great genghis khan and julius caesar to name a few of the world's greatest i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin especially on the big screen
<START> has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene by scene remake of the 1933 version with some of the scenes taken out it makes me think less of a film that does that showing a definite want of creativity in all fairness i tend to be biased in favor of katharine hepburn but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism the 1933 version was nice and sweet though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times and then this version took the script the music and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version i don't understand the point of making the film again when the method of remaking it was to basically redo george cukor's film with everything the same except the people working on it
<START> i must confess that i don't remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course it's one of the best movie from christopher lambert br br a good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller
<START> this movie is simply amazing unfortunately in portugal not even a shadow of him and i agree with a former opinion only ff fans will really give the movie the real credit but for the rest i dare you to watch it the story is great and i thought that the game has ended the story but the screenwriters have given us a great story to the god of all r p g 's the ost as usual it came from heaven but the little details that they gave us us fans of the game are beautiful like the ring tone is the battle winning song of the game and even some moves are quite familiar just watch it it's a great movie great story great animation just a 10 10
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out patty didn't want to be separated from her siblings however the juvenile justice system don't care when patty looked at the case file the judge sent her to a juvenile detention facility he claimed she violated the rules of privacy by looking at private files she just wanted her family together i couldn't blame her the parents were not even fit parents one of the smaller children had to have a restroom the father stopped and let them off he drove off him and left the children stranded at the service station patty had to take authority to protect them since she was the oldest they were placed in foster homes the good part is that the social worker got them back as a family the head social worker kept telling him to butt out and not interfere he was power crazy he was the one who had patty placed in the juvenile facility why didn't they go after the father who was released from prison for abandonment yet the children are caught in the middle and made to feel insecure
<START> i really wanted to be able to give this film a 10 i've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live action batman films to date and maybe it still will be i have yet to watch the schumacher films again i'm also starting to become concerned about whether i'm somehow subconsciously being you see i always liked the schumacher films as far as i can remember they were either 9s or 10s to me but the conventional wisdom is that the two tim burton directed films are far superior i had serious problems with the first burton batman this time around i ended up giving it a 7 and apologize as i might i just couldn't help feel that batman returns just has too many small direction plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10 br br but burton almost trumps the problems with sheer force of style and even though there are a lot of small flaws batman returns is still a great film especially if you're a burton fan as batman returns has just as much in common with the nightmare before christmas 1993 and edward scissorhands 1990 as it does with anything else in the batman universe br br the film begins strongly with the having a baby we see their dismay people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces ready to vomit later they have the baby in a small cage finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the gotham city river the baby ends up becoming batman villain the penguin danny devito br br meanwhile max christopher walken is the film's evil capitalist comparable to grissom jack palance in batman he is planning on duping gotham city in various ways and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary the timid selina kyle michelle pfeiffer when kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots grissom tries to get rid of her but she is rescued by cats becoming catwoman br br while all of this is going on the penguin who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy despite having less than benevolent ulterior motives br br before re watching burton's batman films this time i didn't remember just how little the films are about batman michael keaton it's almost as if burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on the focus here is much more on the villains especially the penguin batman doesn't appear very often especially in the beginning of the film and surprisingly often we're watching him watching the penguin br br although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw i can't say that i do even if i'd like to know more about batman and follow his story more the villains' stories are interesting too and as an origin story for two major batman villains batman returns is already more than complex in terms of plot br br however there are some character problems that i do count as a flaw the penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding but even though they're frequently on screen we never get to learn anything about them burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in tod browning's freaks 1932 available with actors as interesting as vincent schiavelli but he just doesn't have the space to use them br br for that matter he hardly has space to explore catwoman the film plays as if catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long so the bulk of the catwoman scenes had to be excised of course all of this barely leaves any room for batman burton has batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film and unusually he never bothers to resolve this as far as we know at the end still think that batman is a murdering lunatic that's an interesting development but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next br br as for the script although there are minor problems including some non sequiturs and bizarre decisions in terms of logic made by characters it's clear that burton and writers sam hamm and daniel waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story a lot of the dialogue is pun oriented but often this is fairly subtle and or complex of course sometimes it is very blatant or transparent too it helps to look at batman returns as a more poetic film as i believe was the intention this also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions plenty of odd character actions including from minor characters are done in service of a general mood or style and that style works very well br br dark is the easiest way to sum up batman returns in a word and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition anyone who knows me knows that i love dark so for me burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script in many ways batman returns is like an insane campy horror film with beautifully eerie production design like batman burton is still making many references to other films but instead of vertigo 1958 and star wars 1977 well there's still a slight star wars reference he invokes films like nosferatu 1922 including that max schreck was the name of the actor who played the dracula like character there motel hell 1980 the aforementioned freaks willy wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 which has a surreal dark edge to it and zombie films made most explicit in the penguin's final scene br br in terms of visuals and general atmosphere and that includes the general feel of the story the characters and so on this couldn't be a stronger 10
<START> they both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them this is beautiful but the incertitude is more beautiful they believed that they had never been met nothing has happened between them but those roads those stairs those corridors for all that time they could have been met although it did not mean to be it was a swan song two young people who are neighbors and have never been met are found in the same places the same times doing most of the times the same things they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together meanwhile the woman has met an old man their relation is brotherhood like he told her his life it was like the young one's but with better the young man can do whatever the old man has not lived he can be happy with the woman the ending is exceptional there is a ship wreck the only survivors are the heros of the three colors the man and the woman finally meet the scene lasts a few seconds the woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film sad in a red fond but every start is only the continue the book of the life is opened in the middle
<START> i concur with the other users comment hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's i think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up if anyone can truly say this is a good movie they need to be locked up it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it i feel i lost intelligence from watching this i used to have a little respect for chuck norris before i watched this but now i just feel bad i bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for 9 99 and i can honestly say i would have been better off literally throwing the money away forgive me jesus
<START> who doesn't love the muppets impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so i guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special i don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly in fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self conscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique the magic transcends all that other stuff 'tis indeed what movies are made of br br so how does the film achieve these things hmmm nice question stumped am i let's see really i feel like it's quite simple the filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process i probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack a zest you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing br br generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance maybe i don't feel i have much to say about it because i was half asleep when i saw it and or as i write this review anyway i'm sort of semi repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had full of love i suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly br br and to repeat myself once more one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being like a butterfly so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that anyway if that sounds sappy i also reckon it was pretty hilarious br br so all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it features lots of great music highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart
<START> george segal lives with his elderly and senile mother there are many jokes about her alzheimer's like dementia and most of them aren't funny though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home at first segal tries to kill his mother because she's tough to live with and because he's a selfish guy making the film sort of like a wiley coyote versus the roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot too bad this was not the overall tone of the film br br i do applaud carl reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone i have a special place in my heart for films like ed and his dead mother eating raoul and happiness of the katakuris all films about death that dare to offend the problem here though is that where's poppa has some funny moments but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland plus topics such as homosexual rape incest and the like are really difficult to make funny i read in the rough guide to cult movies that it is considered a cult film though i just can't see anyone wanting to see this more than once
<START> every time i think about this film i feel physically ill to read such a great book and later discover there's a film of it was a great feeling years later and imagine my joy at switching on the sci fi channel and finding it starts in just 5mins up go the titles and then if just a couple of things had changed ok everything is changed numerous characters are removed entirely new rubbish ones are added the main hero is shrunk and de aged by about 30 years and hilariously his girlfriend wife is now his mother even the dog is reduced to sub lassie capabilities this is truly appalling cinema at its absolute worst i would quite happily remove my own toenails with pliers rather than sit through another horrific viewing and i urge anyone thinking of watching this please don't if you own a copy burn it now right now and think how much better your life would have been had this celluloid insult never occurred
<START> carmen is a prostitute that lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the spanish army she is without any doubt the best femme fatale at the moment when a man resist her charming attentions she decides to do everything to destroy him at the end he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with carmen despite paz vega is very beautiful she doesn't seem a gypsy as carmen is and neither her acting nor are good the story results very boring and in most moments it is very absurd while intending to appear truthful in the same way are the scenarios and the special effects despite not being but they are not but acceptable and too much artificial for a historic film as it is to sum up boring and bad with a very absurd development there are much betters thing to watch
