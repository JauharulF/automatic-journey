<START> anytime i'm not giving 150 to my dreams or my goals i think of mark the real life subject of american movie mark's dogged persistence at having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will have you laughing shaking your head with sadness and rooting for him br br i haven't seen a documentary this honest since the movie on r the supporting cast mark's real life family and friends are all great give this movie a chance and you'll see a great film and a wonderful portrait of the stuff that the american dream is made of
<START> this review will have some very obvious spoilers so beware br br a friend brought this over and we made it through 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that fast forward speed was the only way that this film should be watched there were points when we were watching the movie at normal speed where i would leave prepare part of lunch and return to find that literally nothing had happened 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged nothing happened the background no important facial gestures were made nothing but mind numbing awkward silence br br this is not how to make a thoughtful film especially when the movie's plot follows all the same basic hollywood movie tropes if i told you that disney was making a film about 4 girls starting a band and the singer was a french exchange student what you would expect to be the conflicts that arise br br the lead singer has to overcome stage fright someone has an unspoken crush the band is late for their performance and a side character has to buy them time br br spoiler alert br br all of those things happen in this movie br br at no point in this film do you have even the slightest fraction of concern that these girls won't be able to accomplish their goal br br this ends the section of spoilers br br i like japanese films i've spent a lot of time in japan i work for a japanese company heck i even know all the bands referenced in the record collections and mds that they're going through and i've sung along to the title track with friends at karaoke br br this is probably the worst film from japan i've ever seen do not be confused though the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical japanese high school things this is not a typical day in the life of movie this is a day in the life of 4 extremely random heavily conflicted awkward japanese students br br there are noticeable problems with the dvd as well viz decided that a great extra would be a producer reading aloud the wikipedia entry about the blue hearts what a value in addition they care so little about the subtitling that the band's name in the subtitles is different than it is in the chapter selection menu in the final auditorium scene there is a very visible reflection ghosting effect on everything but this seems to be the fault of the original film br br 2 10 do not view if you do not absolutely love awkward silences
<START> i wasn't expecting citizen kane but i was hoping for some extreme guilty pleasure the script is bad but the school exterior shots were obviously done with the same 5 extras on the same day the dorm exterior shots were easily shot during a hurricane br br the wardrobe was swapped around so much i hoped the wardrobe mistress had some good strong soap to wash the panties i know the time but do you think they could have bought a couple of different styles of underwear what oversexed up vampiric hot chick would wear boy leg panties under latex trousers i was relieved to see one appearance of thong in the penultimate scene br br good points the actors were all very attractive and the girls had natural boobs too bad they never took the bras off br br the special effects were neither effective and could only be describes as special if they rode the short bus to the edit bay the final scene in particular is horrifically laughably bad br br
<START> i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television and sorely disappointed at the end result br br the only amazing thing was the wall crawling despite the visibility of the cable i didn't think nick hammond was peter parker and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit you could tell they were two different actors br br granted i can also spot in the modern spider man movies when i am looking at tobey and when i am looking at cgi but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi still the 70's version could have been better despite lack of special fx br br the webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in hello he's the web people br br sorry didn't mean to get so worked up but our beloved wall crawler deserved better
<START> why bother to see this movie it probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since clark gable's laughable playing of an irish patriot in parnell br br it's inconceivable that bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time to begin with there was no script to work with except a few notes then we are supposed to believe the polished bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp including marriage to a poor italian fisherman she doesn't even love i read where anna magnani was the original choice for this part if so that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous bergman in such a proletarian part but since she was in love with her director common sense flew out the window br br so she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea a place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in br br her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day on top of all of this there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava but like a true heroine bergman against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film she even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island to her no sacrifice is too great no man if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery i won't bother to tell you how this all ends the no script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of stromboli i even remember from seeing it on late night tv that it had two different endings so be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king size turkey and catch the miscast bergman it led to her downfall in hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to peter lindstrom none of the movies she made with this director whom she later married are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk i kid you not it's pretty embarrassing br br soundtrack
<START> i was looking forward to this so much being a big fan of the book however when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i've ever spent at the cinema br br in principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why i'm rating this a 4 br br in this version sara is a little too self sacrificing for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar br br there's also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset while the book does have a happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesn't leave you thinking oh puh leeze br br about the only things true to the book were br br 1 sara's father being a soldier 2 the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heart no i know you by heart you are inside my heart 3 sara's friendship with becky and her lottie although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been 4 the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done 5 the basic core a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly is there but that's about all that is br br people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all i can say to that is i have two cousins aged 7 and 12 respectively who were big fans of this film until they read the book br br if all you want is a 'feel good' family film then this delivers if you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess in fact if you've read the book don't waste time with this one it's such a shame with a cast like this if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic br br am i harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt a book especially such a classic into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once
<START> it may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of slasher movies in the early 1980's that a few good ones might slip through the cracks this is a great rare film from jeff who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films squirm and blue sunshine br br five young people head into the oregon mountains this movie was actually shot on location to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired before long they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh br br just before dawn is noticeably more ambitious arty and intelligent than some slasher films actually fleshes out the characters well two of them anyway as much as a 90 minute long film will allow him the film has genuine moments of suspense and tension and actually refrains from graphic gore save for one killing right at the beginning br br there is an above average cast here including oscar winner george kennedy as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long jack lemmon's son chris future brian de palma regular gregg henry blonde lead deborah benson it's too bad she hasn't become a more well known performer judging by her work here ralph seymour ghoulies mike sleepaway camp and jamie rose chopper chicks in round out the cast br br some of the shots are interesting and the early music score by brad now best known for his terminator theme is haunting and atmospheric br br this is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon one of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer which i'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again br br i didn't give it 10 out of 10 because i can't honestly that i was that frightened still it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re discovery br br that deed don't mean nothing son those mountains can't read br br 9 10
<START> i thought that this movie was incredible i absolutely loved it even though my brothers didn't that much the special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen it was everything i would expect out of a movie i just loved it also it was pretty kid friendly this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible i would give it a pure 10 10 it was better than the legend of and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined absolutely amazing loved it
<START> i remember seeing this film when i was fairly young being quite disturbed by it i found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used one in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful they also bound him and shaved his private parts this was all because he was unpopular why was he unpopular because he was bad at games i have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular to me he is the type of person who would always be picked on because that's how children operate popular children are popular because they are in some way 'cool' popularity is a hard thing to define so even at the end when he is successful in his career it makes no difference he is still left feeling tormented i found the ending quite distressing as there was no resolution
<START> to the guy who hatched the idea for lifeforce i have one thing to say thank you sir lifeforce combines the big budget sci fi pomp of star trek the motion picture with the cheap horror thrills of phantasm and tops it all off with t ts and some real meaty hangers at that and best of all it's actually a good movie it amazes me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hot chick to appear naked on screen for an hour and a half to producers god bless you all of you who were involved br br steve railsback helter skelter plays col carlson the american commander of an international space mission sent to investigate halley's comet carlson's crew finds an alien vessel inside the comet and inside that they find three naked people in suspended animation two guys and a hot broad mathilda may well to make a long story short they're space vampires naked space vampires they trash the crew except for col who decided that he had to let the hot chick out of her display case because the part of his brain that controls his nut fluids told him it was the right thing to do the col wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape pod meanwhile another space shuttle crew has discovered his ship floating dead in space and has brought the three space coffins of the living dead martians back to london and that's when people start turning into pork and s t in general just starts getting' way out of hand too damn fast br br carlson teams up with the unflappable col caine peter firth of the british s a s to track down our naked cutie who is having one hell of a time sucking guys off left and right carlson's discovered that he has a mental link with vampira that allows them to track her down with the ultimate goal being to blow her ass away and wreck her and her big space umbrella that sucks up the energy of the people that the vamps attack will they succeed in time minor spoiler yes br br wow what can i say but wow this damn movie really works i can't believe they got actual british actors like aubrey morris a clockwork orange and patrick stewart sexiest man alive or some such title to appear in this film all the actors are good direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of london special effects are no slouch either for 1985 this movie must've been the s t as far as fx goes all the effects are fairly impressive and there's a wide range of talent on display here in makeup effects light shows and very nice space scenes with some good old fashioned modeling and matte painting very nicely done there's even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the horror fanboys out there br br lifeforce is a great film for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular films on the were made with 100 love from start to finish the creators of the movie really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that doesn't let you turn away because the proceedings are just too good looking real solid entertainment here 8 1 2 out of 10
<START> one of the best horror suspense movies i have seen in a long time wow it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare i expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart br br this is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening i know some people in other reviews compare it to open water but i disagree because i thought open water was quite boring and mediocre while this movie was the opposite although superficially they are filmed in the same realistic style br br the actors are unknowns at least to me but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism the story is well done and flows smoothly the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it br br i had tears in my eyes at the end i must say a movie seldom has this effect on me this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and i am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie
<START> is the princess bride meets well trainspotting but wait really it's a good combination this was definitely one of the better movies i've seen in a long time it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the this is odd lack of any really good guys that trainspotting had br br i'm not saying it was as good as the princess bride but it was in the arena and it rocked some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant the plot is interesting the characters while slightly are not due to their intrinsic nature there were flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks but just in a bit of the language they used the anachronisms made it fun though and not cheesy and easily dismissed br br if you've ever read any simon r green or cook's garrett series you know exactly what this movie is check it out it's great
<START> the nest is really just another run horror flick that fails because of the low budget the acting is ok and the setting is great but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me the gore effects are not the best i've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs if you liked the nest then slugs is a must see as it's ten times better also worth noting is that lisa who plays elizabeth was in another run type film called deadly eyes aka the rats which is about killer rats as you may have guessed br br if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory
<START> meticulously constructed and perfectly played to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age br br based on william trilogy these three 90 minute films chronicle the journey towards both australia and experience of youthful aristocrat edmund talbot benedict aboard an aging man o' war in the early 19th century as he heads for a government position down under br br among the crew and hopeful sharing his passage are a tempestuous bullying captain jared harris a politically radical philosopher sam neill a canny 1st lieutenant who's worked his way up from the bottom jamie and fleetingly the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman joanne page whose ship literally passes in the night br br quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy director david and screenwriters tony and leigh jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the napoleonic era br br shipboard life is one brutal monotonous round of seasickness squalor and danger after another and as edmund becomes entangled in the loves hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life's hardships man's inhumanities and his sentiments br br those who enjoyed master and commander the far side of the world or patrick o'brian's series of novels on which it was based will love this Â for everyone else it's a whole new world to discover
<START> this is one of the best movies i've seen the acting is good the plot is solid and the whole movie is very believable which adds a lot to the movie i rate this at least a 9
