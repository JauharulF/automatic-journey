<START> as a bit of a michael dudikoff fan i sat down to watch one of his good old fashioned actioners i'm still waiting br br the film is based around a group of us commandos trying to get rid of a bunch of syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor maddie reese felicity waterman was an english member of the commando unit and of course she became romantically involved with tom dickson dudikoff i must ask since when have the brits had female sas members as far as i know if they are ever needed they are got from other sources even if they did i can pretty much guarantee they wouldn't be as wet as maddie reese i would also think that tom dickson would be a little more responsible in his position or have i lost the plot i know there is always the romantic angle in these films as it helps provide the feelgood factor but does it have to be throughout especially when there's more important things to be taken into consideration like nuclear warfare br br the signing of the treaty on the us aircraft carrier intrigued me the sacred pen as carried by one of the supposed tv news crew are there were no security checks to find out who or what goes on board one of these ships especially with the calibre of people that was on it mind you if there was i suppose there would be no story br br i could go on but when it got to inner body bomb in order to safely remove a bullet i gave up on the action drama movie bit and enjoyed it for the comedy it actually was br br by the way would a news reporter really say downtown damascus
<START> when this movie came out in 1995 i found it amazingly great especially with sandra bullock after having watched her brilliant performance in speed i was ready to enjoy any of her movies br br back to the net it was a movie that keeps you in suspence all in all i enjoyed it so i give it a out of
<START> this was one of my favorites as a child my family had the 8 track tape soundtrack it took us years until i was in my 20s for us to get a video of the movie my dad taped it from hbo or something every summer when we go to the beach my mom brother sister and i we lay on the beach and sing all the songs from this movie loved it
<START> one true thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role a beautiful drama one true thing is a prime example of movie making in the late 1990's there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects it's no best picture or anything don't be silly but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock wave i cried twice in this movie which says a lot for a 24 year old man
<START> a space odyssey is a supremely intriguing space travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future it is one of the very few great films of our times it gives us something to think talk and argue it wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity it inspires us to dig for insights br br as a science fiction fantasy it is one of the most original films ever made kubrick's camera dances to the blue danube with planets floating through the light years it's an experience in the poetry of motion a rich statement to the power of cinema br br but 2001 reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all it's instead a philosophical enigma a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else br br 2001 is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms the people in this classic science fiction epic hardly matter kubrick relates a chronology in images of mountains the desert the technology the space capsule the computer named hal who is more interesting than the humans and the time warp the final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius br br as a terror story too it is a towering achievement not on the same scream inducing level as hitchcock's psycho but in an innocent and far more haunting way the film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man in kubrick's fantasy the golden age of man was a neglected instant between a man exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the earth man has indeed evolved br br as a spectacle 2001 assaults the mind eye and ear with stimulating images and suggestions we are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment the film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments the first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually without a single line of dialog the zero gravity toilet with its great list of instructions the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down the frightening moment when we realize that hal is reading the astronauts lips the magical of sun moon and earth the returning home to charm the orb br br 2001 is filled with poetic imagery the view of the sun rising over the earth the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet br br 2001 is also a work of great visual acuity it allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery they insist upon an answer where there can only be a question every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of kubrick's filmÂ but for those who can accept mysticism the climax is deeply moving
<START> i saw chomps during the approximately 2 days of its theatrical release it is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs the simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts is both sympathetic and heartwarming it is also thought provoking with deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty personal behavior and bullying movies have different and different purposes this movie which is delightful to all ages offers an interesting humorous look into our own experiences everyone will recognize personality and behaviors types of themselves and others everyone will see the humor the humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level br br for lighthearted laughter and a 'feel good' movie chomps is an excellent choice memorable
<START> my boyfriend and i decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie worth seeing even up there with cars within the first ten minutes of the movie i was horrified for starters the cows which should be females had male voices then i realized they really are supposed to be guys i put the transvestite cows aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind but it was just so corny i couldn't help but shake my head i probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over the plot was decent if not predictable but it took way to long to reach its point i was having trouble sitting through it and i'm 19 the children in the theater were actually getting up and running up and down the aisles i felt like joining them but my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking references not to mention that the cows bulls actually hot wired and stole a car then drank and drive broke into a boy's house to push him out of bed he deserved it though then ran away from the cops whom the writers of the movie made look like terrible people this isn't the kind of thing i would want my kid to be exposed to there's way too much of that in the real world if i wanted my child to watch guys drink and drive and lead cops on a chase i'd pop them in front of the 10 o'clock news children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality not an escape into ridiculousness what happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast that's why disney's old movies like beauty and the beast lady and the tramp the little mermaid etc are classics if you want your kids to see a great cartoon with basically the same plot as barnyard rent the lion king you can get a great story without the awful drinking and driving and grand theft auto references the writers of barnyard were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a children's movie that a parent could enjoy as well but they did so in very bad taste i would never take my kids to see this and i suggest you save your money and watch something else
<START> when in 1982 the thing came out to theaters everywhere it had a cold reception and very poor box office results becoming almost a failure in john carpenter's career as a horror director however time has proved that the thing was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film's fault nowadays john carpenter's the thing has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic and not without a reason as this new version of john w campbell jr 's story who goes there previously adapted as the thing from another world is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia br br the plot of the thing begins in the winter of 1982 in a u s research station located in the remote territories of antarctica when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a husky dog who makes its way into the american base after the norwegians are killed accidentally the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane soon they'll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog but a creature able to mimic every living creature and not only that it has a tremendous hunger br br director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher halloween where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock the thing could be seen as an evolution of that style as even when carpenter makes great use of rob special effects which were labeled by critics as repulsive on its day the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent and very well done displays of gore the feeling of loneliness as well as the bad karma between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing even our main character r j macready kurt russell ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted br br this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was blatantly ignored by the previous version not completely a bad thing just a big difference making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel bill lancaster's script handles the characters with brilliant domain giving us enough to distinguish them but not too much to completely trust them making them an essential factor in the film's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie the mystery and the suspense are at the max as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results br br the cast is very effective and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real carpenter's regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse definitely one of his best performances wilford brimley is also terrific as dr blair a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing's purposes br br the thing is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed although they exist the most notorious being the very low key and at times score by ennio morricone it's not exactly bad but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer also due to some with the special effects some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes although nothing of big importance or actually annoying br br when talking about john carpenter's films most people will almost instantly name halloween as his favorite film but personally i would go with the thing as i consider it carpenter's greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made 10 10
<START> the cell is a rather difficult film to classify if you read the plot outline a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction but that doesn't really do this movie justice there is a fantasy aspect within the sub conscious minds that is stunning with lavish visuals and incredible mind tripping scenarios there is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing and there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience i find it to be completely fascinating br br right from the opening credits with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress you will know that you are in for a visual treat every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her patients they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour the camera leaves at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same the characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature if you don't enjoy anything else about the cell you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes br br the casting is top notch also jennifer lopez is in her element here utilizing her natural compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings makeup and costumes she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman but it is without a doubt vincent d'onofrio that has the biggest impression here it's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer we are disgusted at his actions yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life he looks magnificently powerful within his realm yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world it's a great performance from an underrated actor br br while the cell doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts some of the actions of the characters are not believable and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic it is an occasionally shocking visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings
<START> this old stinker makes the flash gordon movies look sophisticated it's so terrible i love it and i wish i could find a tape but none of the catalogs i've checked list it the rock band leader who calls himself commander cody must have loved it too because he named his band after it
<START> this is a thoughtful film that lays bare the inequities of the so called upper class and those who work for them the haves and have nots robert shaw does a creditable job in his role as the obliging correct chauffeur steven who helps lady franklin sarah miles overcome her mental depression at the outset however steven has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class he inevitably falls in love with her which of course is the societal boundaries that separate them br br i have not read anything prior to this and only judge the movie as i have seen it i consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily living and the conflict of what we might wish or expect from life and what we get it's a fine drama worth seeing again
<START> i want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english subtitle translation which was actually written not spoken in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist was meant to be self referential in a tongue in cheek manner but if so director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke br br some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique bizarre films because they do so with Ã©lan and unique personal style e g david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story e g kieslowski and david cronenberg's later less bizarre works in x carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it well here it is the pacing is erratic and choppy in particular continuity is often dispensed with superfluous characters abound e g the gypsy mother and child most of the performances are overwrought the lighting is often poor particularly in the oft discussed sex scene unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list goes on br br not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions i liked the musical score even the cacophonous industrial techno music being played in the sprawling abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to andy warhol's of the '60s much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings and even well into middle age deneuve shows that she still has 'it' her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos br br there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as x more charitably experimentation is admirable even when the experiment doesn't work but carax tries nothing new here the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of films later i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe at this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking with the exception of jean pierre jeunet are there any directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore rating 3 10
<START> harry knowles has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd stating the next icon of horror really i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasn't totally convinced however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem not here not hatchet hatchet is poorly conceived poorly acted and un funny just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and candyman and a buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror sorry i don't even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic honestly my money is on rob zombie there is a man who knows old school horror forget this trash
<START> watchable but pretty terrible how shocking that this was the great gregory la last directing credit even in his better known roles i don't care for gene kelly he seems to me to be smug hostile and self involved here paired with a minor actress like marie wilson he seems to show those characteristics in spades br br marie wilson playing an heiress who falls for a military man is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic the actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard disagreeable core of the picture and they do ok br br the know it all butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits for which franklin pangborn was famous and in which despite their stereotyping he was generally funny unlike this guy phyllis thaxter is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot
<START> a real life alaskan adventure is a great tv film for all ages the movie focuses around fizzy alyssa milano who wants to go on travel for gold in alaska the only person who hires her is pierce thomas madison bruce campbell what comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget this tv film was just great the acting is 1 especially by bruce campbell and alyssa milano and i also learned some information about the i recommend this tv film to all without hesitation it is also based on a true story br br 10 10
