<START> darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic the stars julie andrews rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried it's full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you the brilliance of the director blake edwards is shown to be at his best he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen br br the blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews br br for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released is a total shock br br as it is inspirational purely inspirational one of andrews most memorable lines in this film
<START> i truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes but this one is completely different it's simply brilliant plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great br br i've seen it at least dozen times and still i'm not tired with the plot characters or music i just love the soundtrack it's the only soundtrack that i've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that i owe br br for me it's a must seen kind of movie great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end
<START> what a turd i like john leguizamo but man this is bad i thought spawn was the worst movie he had been in but i was wrong i like all types of comedy from stuff like ace ventura 2 to american werewolf in london this is a piece of trash
<START> milo is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked do we really need more slashers i for one think we already have more than enough i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it a long time ago he drowned but that didn't bother him and he still kills people friday the 13th what's that one day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist milo comes to pay them a visit through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo's dull i mean dark secret she and her friends have been dying to know once discovered milo goes on yet another murderous rampage isn't it his bedtime yet and the girl well she screams a lot the acting is not even bottom of the barrel the barrel refuses to be associated with it milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that but some movies just can't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity
<START> this was one of the biggest pieces of crap i have ever had to watch i mean seriously how would anybody else feel if they were in woody harrelson's shoes and your wife was even considering it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks after all she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it how can you trust her who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married i don't care how desperate they were that's the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life then he flips out on her apparently he had no right to mistrust her other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome oh and wait then he's supposed to apologize to her after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with of course woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has roy card in her wallet then at the end of the movie she's apparently so in love with woody still and misses him so much that she was not going to leave hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave and she bleeping thanks hobbs are you bleeping kidding me was she under contract as his sex slave or something i mean what the bleep oh and wait it gets better she bleeping kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car yea she's not a whore oh thank you for letting me go let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake smooch smooch smooch even though i'm still married to a guy i left for a rich guy i have never seen such a piece of crap in my life how the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending what was this movie supposed to represent nothing came out of this this was the most pointless movie i have ever seen in my life two pathetic desperate people if i were woody i would tell her to go drown herself in that body of water they were near apparently he had no self respect what the hell was roy hobbs thinking by taking this horrible role i feel like puking after watching this this movie was so bad it was seriously laughable i want those two hours of my life back that i wasted watching this piece of
<START> the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece john garfield ann revere lilli william conrad canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen james wong howe this remake is abominable in spite of the presence of rod steiger joe mantegna and jennifer beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original only the main character's name charlie davis is the same in both films i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake i am amazed that rod steiger participated this may be the only bad film he ever made maybe he needed the paycheck
<START> i don't know if it's fair for me to review this i'm not a fan of gratuitous violence i've never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers when the godfather came out i thought they had broken the mold but the decades have produced a series of well acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them this one is obviously low budget but it is certainly well done at some point in all of these i feel like i want to take a shower if such characters actually exist it is hard for the soul i always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing this kind of crud has to be stopped i hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment in fairness i am judging this on the acting and directing and for what it is it seems to work pretty well
<START> criticism does mention spoilers br br i rarely make user comments but this is one movie i have no problem slandering this movie stinks and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were despite what its ad claims this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller the pace of this movie was extremely slow i actually left for about 10 minutes half way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression i refer to you the part where angelina jolie's character debates denzel about cutting off a hands the movie is not at all scary but tries to compensate this with a love subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie's character and denzel washington's of course what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor student relationship as seen in the epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling however even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two with such a crappy movie i was half expecting a plot twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved a situation which alfred hitchcock's rear window the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen esoterically speaking i even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial game' and gets with his pet project angelina br br if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts like i am you will not appreciate this film if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne the late night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serial killer to prime investigator relationship the horrible trying to get by in an all male dominated workforce aka see this movie but even then its too slow paced and you'd be bored
<START> i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it it really touched me and i thoroughly enjoyed noel coward's work in it highly recommended atmospheric and touching br br i think of this film from time to time and am disappointed it hasn't enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films hadn't realized til i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben hecht and charles macarthur br br basically it involves a nasty character who destroys another's career and is cursed because of it he dies but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal well written and lovely i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on tv late one night in new york a must see if you ever have the opportunity
<START> this film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast glynn turman preach jackson is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend lawrence hilton jacobs morris was an outstanding athlete at the cooley h s and even won a scholarship to a famous college there are scenes in this picture with the chicago police department chasing all these dudes in a cadillac and a visit to the lincoln park zoo with monkey dung being thrown around the music is outstanding and there is great photography around the city of chicago great film enjoy
<START> every time this movie used to re air on late night tv in the late 70s and early 80s i would always make time to sit in front of the tv and watch it to see the lovely kate jackson handsome richard long the great polly bergen whom i've never seen anywhere else except for this tv movie the endearing tom bosley and another great whom i've never seen outside this movie celeste this is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good and every time i would watch it i would always forget who the real murderer was br br as expected someone here is already criticizing the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone this is a great tv movie and worth watching each and every time i can't say that about half the movies i've seen this month br br if you ever get a chance to watch it on tv someday which isn't likely watch it in light of the girl most likely to finally coming out this year on dvd maybe there's hope for a dvd release of death cruise
<START> this is a good film no doubt but with some odd aspects without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only a sicilian farm the boat and ellis island new york all shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything i wonder if this was to save money no street scenes anywhere and we don't even see the boat except in close ups and the music what on earth was going on with playing nina simone songs decades before they were out i could have done without the milk river business too but hey before you think of me as a pure misanthrope let me repeat this is a very good film with moments wonderful photography great characters and more accuracy than the usual american efforts at the immigration experience
<START> i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie bad characters bad story and bad acting it would be a love story between a man and a mermaid really awful
<START> excuse me but my tongue was too in my cheek when we filmed this piece o' poop as the evil sister with hair that mommy dearest would envy i did my very best to channel tim curry in rocky horror i'm sad that this did not come across ah well a friend compared it to a 'rock bottom budget with a white hot spoon ' i'll have to be content with that br br what amazes me is no one mentioned the endless and dull wet t shirt contest it is seriously the longest wet t shirt contest in cinema history and the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cotton polyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent br br and didn't anyone catch the director's cameo as the dude on the interrupted by our hero with the line 'are we filming yet clearly audible jeez this is bad movie heaven for real aficionados
<START> i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed br br it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool br br i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity br br surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of it's time br br 8 out of 10 kids
