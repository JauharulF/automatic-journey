<START> the movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died br br the movie is good in parts but overall isn't great br br the scenes between rani and ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled br br the film is too similar to bollywood hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost br br milan disappoints overall after br br music is good but too many songs br br ajay devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too rani is good sonali is good too rest are okay
<START> there are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as mishima a life in four chapters one of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film this film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy but it also flows through some of yukio mishima greatest stories this film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch not to mention the incredible philip glass soundtrack

<START> this blaxploitation classic about a kung fu mama who travels to hong kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you learned to expect from the genre playmate jeannie bell with a giant afro really kicks ass and usually loses her clothes very quickly if you don't take it all too seriously the movie is great fun to watch stan shaw gives a solid performance jeannie bell is a little less convincing pam grier she ain't br br this is where quentin tarantino got his idea for the light switch scene in jackie brown from br br the soundtrack by don julian is a gem and is frequently used in rap songs
<START> extremely entertaining mid 1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a 96 minute running time most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable more than just a b western but not really an epic the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names glenn ford was the only box office draw at the time edward g robinson and barbara stanwyck were past their primes and looking for work stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in the big valley brian keith and dianne foster were just starting out br br ford plays john parrish a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big robinson hired gunman parrish is a former confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons br br robinson plays lee who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest making good on a promise to his wife martha stanwyck lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier his brother cole keith has come up from texas to help him run the huge spread lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious between stanwyck and keith but sensitive daughter judith foster is understandably upset by what is going on in their home br br john parrish has promised his fiancÃ©e caroline may that he will move back east caroline who is modeled on grace kelly's high noon character breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film this leaves the way open for a john and judith romance to develop br br the violence starts early and continues throughout the film with parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination he has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film ford plays one of his standard characters the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self deprecating manner who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked very much like his role in the br br robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self and he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character br br stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two faced woman a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother in part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character that said a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations br br dianne foster is a pleasant surprise she should remind viewers a lot of carroll baker both physically and in acting style although required to play judith according to 1950's convention she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation foster shows a nice range she conveys a growing attraction for parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place br br the real problem with the violent men is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment this is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like caroline br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> okay i love this movie i watched it over and over again it is so hard to tell who the attacker is you keep thinking it's one person then another then back to the first person then another person it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is br br summary gail osborne is raped and left at her home she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend to her teacher who takes a liking to her to her ex boyfriend all different stories all suspects but who did it br br i love the acting they have a lot of great talent in here the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb if it comes on tv watch it 1 2 stars 10 10
<START> sigrid thornton seachange was seemingly born to fill the role of cato's philadelphia gordon in this story that is often compared with margaret mitchell's american civil war classic gone with the wind waters heaven tonight is in arguably his best role also as her love interest and the two leads head a wonderful australian cast in this arguably the most well known and best loved of australian miniseries it's br br an outstanding production all round though don't try watching all of it in one hit and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in pre federation australia rating 8 10
<START> ok when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations yes the acting isn't great and the picture itself looks dated but as i sat there a strange thing happened i started to like it the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump brion james maybe one of the greatest b grade actors next to bruce campbell is great as always the story isn't bad either now i wouldn't rush out and buy it but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b grade post apocalyptic western
<START> the best horror sci fi movie i have ever seen i was myself in the arctic working for canadian government in a small northern station when i see this movie for the first time needless to say i was in the mood
<START> seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t the plot is very superficial and lame and unless indirectly intended this film actually glorify the nazis and portrays them as men of honor and show that the jewish people are deceiving cant keep promises and bloody vicious the following contains spoiler hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous the nazis laughing and each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid the deal at the end is lame whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films will not be surprised if it harvested many awards including oscars as well the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people but hey reconsider its not even doing a great job doing that it truly dwarfed the whole nazi jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the nazis
<START> i like this movie i may be biased because i love dolphins however my 3 and 4 yr old will sit and watch the whole movie it's not oscar material but definitely entertaining the dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets my favorite scene is when flipper flips the pop can out of the water striking sandy in the head it's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time on the other hand the villainous of the bully forget his name are a little hard to take and the shark scene is far from reality question do dolphins really make that much noise or is there some serious dubbing happening here bottom line my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our vcr
<START> unbelievably disappointed the pace was slow the characters unbelievable and throughout the film as a whole just let me feel bored and unfulfilled there was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you interested the heist itself never offered any excitement and didn't seem very well though through br br there was not enough depth or background to any character and character was one i eagerly awaited for unfortunately has no idea how to play the thuggish and is much preferred as a likable character columbus short one of my favourite actors in stomp the yard let me down with his performance his character was dark and you could hardly see what drove his reasoning br br the only character i think offered anything to the film was milo ventimiglia peter in heroes though his character quite small and insignificant i think his touch added to an all around dull film br br in conclusion buy the dvd if you want to find a new way to waste your time
<START> wow did this episode start on a premise the enterprise is along when all of the sudden abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise is it just me or is this a really lame brained idea lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet where they meet other famous dead folks both good and evil it seems that a really cheesy looking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair as the good side is saddled with a vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo despite a totally awful premise the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match but don't mistake this for high art or deep sci fi the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise
<START> in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry br br great editing at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece br br excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz but i guess it's acceptable at certain times br br two scenes which i must point out are the bath tub and the couch scene br br the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition throughout the short i viewed her as a brute but now we see her true reality her mind spoke before her heart need i say more about the bath tub scene
<START> hoot is about these three teenage kids who try to save a bunch of burrowing owls now to me i thinks that right they stand up to whats right and whats wrong in this film a kid name roy eberhardt logan lerman moved from montana to florida and once he gets on the bus a bully name dana starts bullying him finally the next day roy punches the bully and runs off the bus chasing the mysterious running boy after all that roy finally meets the running boy who's name is mullet fingers cody well actually his nickname his step sister beatrice brie larson gave it to him because he can catch mullets with his bare hands anyway mullet fingers and roy becomes friends and they join together with beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant mullet fingers is the one behind all the that happened there and also later he gets bit by one of the dogs that put there to guard the construction site so they stood up to the that was driving the bulldozer and everybody got to see the owls it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where kids can make a difference in life by standing up to whats right and whats wrong thats what is great about this movie it teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is
