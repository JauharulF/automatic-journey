<START> there are certain scenes in this film like the hero's first meeting with super villainess shirley eaton where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise females want to rule the world by making men slaves justice but it never dares to the result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence despite the choppy plot the film is not overly bad until its climax where its amateurishness runs rampant terrible editing overuse of stock footage worth seeing only as a curio 1 2
<START> from the makers of underworld we have by far the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen it is basically a reconstructed version of underworld yet lacking vampires not a big deal cool effects a big deal and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy the biggest deal of them all a twenty something lycanthrope chocolate maker named vivian is currently residing in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves there she belongs to a small society or pack of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly wed the pack leader gabriel whose son some toad with a british accent takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention so of course such activity is considered forbidden vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood thirsty predators when they end up discovering the secret relationship things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted giving the pack a chance to transform into their wolfy selves all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf very cheezy effects the entire movie is like a tamed down underworld with some drippy romantic montages and very little action watching this in the theater i could not wait for it to end a devastatingly boring disappointment avoid
<START> darr 1993 was an incredible movie in my opinion it is one of finest the movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy fear confusion happiness and sadness shahrukh's role was unbelievable in fact he gave obsession a new face juhi innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with shahrukh's fiery and passionate character sunny deol's role made the good guy role seem like the bad guy one the fact that shahrukh not sunny captivated the audience's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that's not really in their hands even though the movie is several years old it surpasses any recent one the song tu mere was full of passion and meaning his personality fit the role perfectly he should seriously consider re starring in a similar film
<START> watching baghban is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one's way out of a vat of saltwater taffy for nigh unto three hours this indian film is a sticky sweet sentimental soap opera that starts off like king lear moves on to romeo and juliet in the middle section then heads back again to king lear for its tear soaked finale br br raj is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life a wife who adores him a family who loves him and a job from which he is about to retire after a lifetime of faithful service even though raj and his wife pooja have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons they still act like a couple of love struck newlyweds and sighing batting their eyes at one another and whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears almost to the point of nausea in fact the whole bloody brood is so happy loving and harmonious that they make the von look like a dysfunctional family in comparison the parents and children joke together laugh together even perform elaborately choreographed spontaneous song and dance numbers together like many bollywood productions baghban is a drama interspersed with a great number in this case far too great a number of musical sequences br br anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss can not be allowed to go unpunished for long and that all that joy is merely the prelude to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers knowing this we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive the occurs about an hour into the film when raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses suddenly like king lear discovering the vipers hidden in the familial bosom raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving selfless and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought understandably horrified at the prospect the kids in order to foil their parents' plan come up with a scheme in which raj will go live with one of their children while pooja will live with another then they will switch off until eventually each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum much to the chagrin of the kids the parents accede to the plan even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart thus the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging albeit married lovers pining away for one another while their ungrateful insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes br br one of the major problems with baghban is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction the love that ray and pooja feel for one another as well as the almost giddy closeness of the family unit is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality then virtually without any warning the screenplay turns on a dime and converts the kids into callous self centered monsters and the parents into passive whiny victims of that callousness raj and pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self reliant to be doing the dreamy eyed pouting unrequited love bit more appropriate to lovelorn school kids than the parents of four grown children the purple prose style in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation the musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy in the beginning but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to unendurable proportions at least a full hour could be excised from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done and quite a bit of good there really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end a speech in which raj who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award winning bestseller lectures us all on the of parent child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least br br baghban is a sappy corny saga filled with more sugar and goo than a king sized box of see's chocolates sample at your own risk
<START> this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess dancing girl from michael rennie as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city state and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs for once she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by lionel newman's music and the film's style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald adams' script set in ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near eastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and well developed storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the film's swift pace well managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects classically trained actors such as michael edgar barrier wally cassell jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here one way of assessing a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions since my answer is a resounding yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated cinematic work could it be that us critics' all too frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to this estimable film's obvious anti tyranny and pro entertainment qualities
<START> i've just seen a couple of episodes of eleventh hour but i must say that they were enough to impress me this series is just so impressive and interesting i'm definitely going to follow it br br first of all i must say that the acting is top notch patrick stewart plays his character ian the scientist believably and coolly and he makes the audience believe in the character other characters such as rachel are also believable and although they sometimes are a little cold due to the way the series is filmed they're interesting br br the stories told by this series are also interesting for example one of the episodes i saw was about cloning and a man who was trying to clone humans the way the episode was developed and how ian stewart kept following clues and saving people was amazing in addition it made you think about ethics and how good or bad could this be br br anyway i think this is one good tv shows i just hope it keeps going on like this interesting thought provoking and with good acting even though it's filmed in a kind of cold way little lightning cold photography lots of close ups it never stops being interesting highly recommendable
<START> there are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one this is the latest film from the dead gentlemen group responsible for the original gamers film and the demon hunters films this group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress br br this film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a gm frustrated by his group's disregard for his story with the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time br br this movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original the movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films the acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny br br unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others so this is why i give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that i initially thought of any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it
<START> i have read all of jane austen's novels right the way through once a year every year since i was 9 years old and received the modern library edition of her collected works as a birthday present br br i loved this movie for its romance and for the music which stayed hauntingly in my head it was an interpretation of course not an emma or a sense and sensibility but something quite different and something catherine herself would have loved and oh to be loved by this passionate henry this was the henry of catherine's imagination and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels and which was promised to us by the practical jane austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely catherine will indeed be one i wonder if jane was being entirely satirical in her novel perhaps she too could imagine such a henry br br i haven't seen the film in many years at least a decade but i have been yearning for it ever since
<START> hearkening back to those good old days of 1971 we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema that's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show we can't recall just whose it was either griffin or woody woodbury one or the other the guest talked about sir charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former little from los on the grounds of his being an undesirable alien no schultz he's not from another planet br br charlie had been deemed to be a due to his interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems everything from the anarchist movement from the '20s and before the craze to socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at chaplin's hollywood parties which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style which we commonly call communism br br compounding mr chaplin's predicament was both confounded by one little detail he had never become an american citizen br br anyhow enough of this background already br br suffice it to say that he had become non in the united states of america it was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the movie houses it'd sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting br br it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist besides the academy of motion pictures arts sciences was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 oscar show this would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have him come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a world wide television audience numbering in the millions br br besides that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre remember the little tramp was as astute as a bu man as he was as a film maker the program consisted of showings of modern times city lights the great dictator verdoux a king in new york and finally the chaplin revue we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest br br in our fair city of chicago it was booked for the carnegie theatre on rush street the festivities lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the public's desire to view each picture as we recall the very last on the schedule was the chaplin revue br br in retrospect we look back and wish that they had begun the run with revue as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers much like ourselves who knew very little about his accomplishments in motion pictures except for those keystone essanay and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so so many kiddy shows all over the country oh well once again no one consulted me br br concentrating on today's honored guest film the chaplin revue we found that it was actually three separate pictures carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin himself some lively themes and incidental music once again written by chaplin and some happy talk and serious narration ditto by chaplin he opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie type of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time showing director chaplin demonstrating just what he wants to a group of actors br br this segment was well done and well received by the audience both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated the rehearsal naturally the building by use of speeding up the camera's photographic process the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves br br this amalgam of shorts incorporated three of chaplin's short comedies from his stint with first national pictures roughly that being 1917 to 1923 the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood br br first up was shoulder arms charles chaplin productions first national pictures 1918 as the title suggests it is a tale of world war i released in october of 1918 with about a month to go before the armistice day of november 11 it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl miss edna the levity is fast physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the enemy the german army br br displaying an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing folks together the next film a dog's life chaplin productions first national 1918 traces the parallel lives of chaplin's tramp and a newly adopted stray scraps the movie story involves families two of them one homo sapiens one canine and both supplying us with some big surprises br br as the finale we have the pilgrim chaplin first national 1923 was a good choice to have as the finale it was bright light and tight it was an excursion into the area of the western spoof comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team the pilgrim in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety but rather a dude or tenderfoot who has ventured out west the tramp is not only that guy but his character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new clergyman of a western town's church br br our rating that is schultz and me is that's four br br poodle schnitz
<START> i was blown away by this film i'm one of those people who just takes a risk with movies that don't especially appeal to me sometimes and i've got to say this one paid off i mean wow even my young boys enjoyed the film 5 and 6 at the time though i'm quite certain this was not geared to their age groups br br this movie was clean too which is a great plus it is so great to sit down to a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity violence except one very brief scene or anything else one is likely to find morally objectionable br br this movie brought you along on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting you feel the vast range of emotions portrayed along with the characters br br i never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat but i couldn't help being intensely interested in how this one would turn out i have nothing to compare it to since i have neither watched golf in reality or on film before but everyone did a great job in keeping the pace and emotions captivating here the score also did wonders excellent excellent score br br even if you don't think this would be your kind of film watch it you may be pleasantly surprised i certainly was
<START> william haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet who thinks west point will really be something now that he has arrived terrific goony comic performance by haines was his trademark one that made him a top box office star from 1928 1932 and one of mgm's biggest stars joan crawford and william bakewell are fine too and although this storyline may seem trite now this was a huge hit putting haines and crawford in a college football a national craze during the 20s story after haines blows off his big mouth one time too often and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets he turns in a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and gets into the big game against navy even with a broken arm he wins the game for army and regains his place at west point it's easy to see from this film and show people with the always underrated marion davies why billy haines was a huge star of the time he needs and deserves to be remembered
<START> yes said title line does actually appear in this movie why i'm not sure when the line was actually being said didn't somebody in the crew filming at some point laugh i would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie mostly because i think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself br br helmed by director jim i know what you did last summer comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven't ever seen a teen slasher movie before of course he's not to be given all the blame there are also three writers responsible and this is somehow based on a video game that's still in production the title of said game is backwater but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothing br br and so we begin the movie i would like to say before i continue that i wasn't expecting this to win an oscar when i am in the right mindset i enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time i think there exists an opportunity for an effective original and smart slasher movie venom is not this movie br br there is almost no character development at all that's fine you don't expect a whole lot however instead of a well knit cast of a few this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clichÃ© characters br br 1 the final girl she has just broken up for her boyfriend this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril they will decide to get back together again which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie eden is played by agnes bruckner without much enthusiasm i might add br br 2 the boyfriend he's just around to co exist with the final girl until his demise sure he can save her but he's doomed and we know it eric is played by jonathan jackson br br 3 the bimbos usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these but here we have two they they steal they might show their breasts not in this case or they might possibly be alcoholics a staple of the genre they also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome usually saying things like hello is there anybody there tammy and patty suitably named are played by bijou phillips and sherwood br br 4 the jackass sure he looks pretty but he's the idiot in the movie that's inserted purely to be an idiot he says stupid things does stupid things has obviously never seen a horror movie and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for sean is played by d j br br 5 the girlfriend she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does and she's usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind rachel is played by laura ramsey br br 6 the creepy janitor in this case the creepy gas station attendant enough said ray is played by rick cramer br br i could continue but i think you get the picture the remaining characters aren't so much common as they are equally there's the gay guy as ricky who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned and the one who knows what's going on of course none of that matters because at first everyone always thinks that one's crazy is played by meagan good br br there are a couple other characters namely a deputy played by method man but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clichÃ©s br br so you're probably thinking why does this movie require such a deep analysis it's just a summer horror flick for out loud based on that question does it deliver the goods yes and no the acting isn't particularly convincing even given the amount of talent involved bijou phillips was hailed for her performance in larry clark's bully and agnes bruckner has been an up and coming talent for a while now br br so what about the gore there's some that's really about it a lot of the bits are cut aways namely a scene involving somebody's face and a used to remove paint from cars br br to the filmmaker's credit there are a couple interesting scenes i liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters br br if this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didn't make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them it might have made for a more enjoyable experience all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not particularly interesting countdown until we know it's just the creepy janitor and the final girl br br i suppose i must be a little jaded but as a horror film fan i'm left wondering why i should have bothered when i could easily have written a better screenplay myself i won't even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi
<START> after three outstanding bbc television series' and a christmas special the bizarre and grotesque yet perversely lovable characters of bleak fictional town royston vasey make the jump to celluloid along with their creators the league of gentlemen br br mark gatiss steve pemberton and reece shearsmith are the more familiar three quarters of the foursome with the central roles shared between the trio in an added twist the final member of the team jeremy dyson is portrayed by actor michael sheen br br where to start dyson sheen is in conversation with his writing cohorts when horror of horrors he is paid a visit by two of his characters both tubbs pemberton and edward shearsmith are unhappy at the decision to kill off the vasey inhabitants you're not real screams dyson in vain as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge mayhem ensues as reality and vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs br br confused you will be as the camp innuendo ridden teutonic herr pemberton is forced to take on the daily guise of pemberton pemberton while pemberton pemberton is kidnapped by cannibalistic butcher hillary briss gatiss and geoff tipps shearsmith br br with shades of an even more demented misery briss attempts to force pemberton to rewrite the film thus continuing his life but leaving geoff in charge is never a good idea the erstwhile comedian becomes embroiled in the latest post vasey adventure the king's evil entering a typically twisted 17th century england complete with cameos from victoria wood peter kay and david warner known as george of asda due to his select line of clothing geoff saves the day and is treated as a hero but for the denouement of the film he joins characters old and new at the church of royston vasey to meet with their makers br br for fans of the series the film is a must see and yes it does feature papa albeit a little too fleetingly pen loving pauline mickey barbara and cursed vet matthew chinnery are some of the other favourites on show and the portrayal of themselves plus sheen's as dyson is also a fascinating insight br br the league of gentlemen are the radiohead of british comedy they are ambitious groundbreaking witness the excellent series three and not happy to rest on their laurels they also divide opinion accordingly br br certainly their macabre sense of humour is not for every palate and while not written exclusively for 'fans' a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series nevertheless apocalypse is a film in its own right and the league will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan as well as appeasing and pleasing existing ones

<START> as jennifer used to say on square pegs gag me out the door i would definitely vote this movie on imdb's worst movie list br br dennis christopher plays t t a guy from chicago who goes to california his brother's jazz records he is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals only surfing community but he acts more like he is new to civilization just try to get through his sex scene without squirming there are also the on going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure that of duke seymour cassell the volleyball expert who tries to get t t to act like a normal human being the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth months br br california dreaming is just a big old mess it starts out like a typical seventies romp complete with bad 70s music even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s and dennis christopher comes off as the most irritable loser it makes the movie hard to watch keep your finger on the fast forward button even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture the surf scenes are almost total garbage the people at the surf contest look as though they can't keep from falling asleep br br i guess the only cool thing is seeing tanya roberts outside of her role as midge on the sitcom that's 70s show and cassell wasn't bad he was just in a bad movie
