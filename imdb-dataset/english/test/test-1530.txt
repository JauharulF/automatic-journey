<START> this was my first look at this short lived british tv horror series but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films horror of dracula captain kronos vampire hunter and thought highly enough of them to give this a look br br this first episode was a shocker not for the horror but for all the nudity was this regular tv in england in 1980 if so it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts one scene where a guy put his hand on one and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse hey i'm not complaining br br the story is a simple one a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man the latter jon finch as david winter wasn't much of an actor but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty she was be prunella gee as mary the husband suspected her rightly so of having an affair and that plays a part in this story br br patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch lucinda jessup who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end as a man i'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it this starts off slowly but once lucinda starts stirring up things it gets very entertaining
<START> i really enjoyed fierce people i discovered the film by accident searching through my on demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch the film is mostly about class in america and it quickly grabs your attention the characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn't stick to the usual hollywood rules br br the main protagonist is finn a precocious but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the osbourne family donald sutherland plays the patriarch ogden c osborne the seventh richest man in america diane lane plays mother a friend of ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut the own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules at first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super rich are different they are used to getting their own way the film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns it is also an r rated movie so it's not entirely wholesome br br the cast is excellent anton yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of finn sutherland and diane lane have never been better chris evans is impressive as devious grandson kristen stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter high quality movie
<START> what a self indulgent mess duncan roy's film is apparently autobiographical however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco br br in a way you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall from abused working class lad to criminal english lord however the tone is either so self pitying or so arch that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot the raw material is potentially great stuff however roy seems unable to tease out the kind of tale that should grab you by the throat then move you to tears and it's a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a triptych of images presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watch br br it's also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors bill nighy diana quick lindsay coulson giving career worst performances
<START> i've seen riverdance in person and nothing compares to the video but the show is awesome the dancers are amazing the music is impacting and the overall performance is outstanding i've never seen anything like it i suggest that you see this show if you can
<START> but i laughed a lot br br i saw et les at a public screening during the world cup the sound was lousy it was too bright to see the screen properly but i still enjoyed myself immensely the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor abba all not very witty but in good tradition some very good jokes but also some that not everybody seemed to get br br the only thing i didn't like were the voices of and in the german version at least the voice actors are very well known around here which was the only reason they were casted really they don't fit the characters at all br br all in all a good way to spend some time and if it's free like in my case all the better and to have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10
<START> broadcast news opens with a series of brief vignettes that are a clever way of starting a story about tv anchors who have no clue as to what they're reporting about br br at a speech before a group of would be reporters all of whom are bored by her presentation most of them leave when the last one exits the co host of the event says quietly to holly hunter i don't think there will be any q a subtle line in a brilliantly written low key comedy a farce about the show biz aspect of tv anchoring br br william hurt is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with holly hunter as the network anchorman hurt badly needs help in remedial reporting and holly refuses to take the bait at first he knows he's only capable of looking good but is not a reporter he proves to be a quick study as long as his earpiece is working and he's getting all the straight info from executive producer hunter br br holly's other anchor friend albert brooks helps by feeding her information she passes on to hurt of course she becomes conflicted about her feelings for ace reporter brooks and equally strong attraction to the pretty boy anchorman hurt who's having his own dalliance with a pretty staff member br br you have to wait until twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she'll end up with brooks tells her that hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she's against in this unpredictable comedy there's no telling who hunter the neurotic heroine will end up with br br fittingly holly hunter william hurt and albert brooks were all nominated for oscars brooks in supporting role as was the film itself and director writer james l brooks all in all seven well deserved oscar nominations br br the script doesn't opt for a conventional happy ending and in this case that's the only flaw for the brilliant screenplay i felt cheated and somewhat let down by the wistful conclusion
<START> i saw this film in the theater when it first came out i'm sorry to say and it was one of only a few films i have ever wanted to walk out of early i didn't have a problem with the drug content and i could see how this cautionary tale could have been powerful the problem was the film maker working with james woods and sean young drew two of the least lovable characters i have ever seen on film i hated this pair and couldn't have cared less if they sunk straight to the inevitable bottom their was not one surprise in this film every turn of events was so painfully obvious that i felt i could have written the script myself although i like to think i would have done a better job i subsequently heard nightmarish stories about the incidents on the set between sean young and james woods along the lines of some sort of stalking events it made me wonder if the terrible acting arose out of some bad feelings and dysfunction anyway i refer to the boost as the worst film i've ever paid money to see
<START> its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder did kieslowski mean that or is it in my head for instance is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being br br also irene jacob as in the double life of is outstanding there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does br br also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to valentine be
<START> not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think it's pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with likeable actors characters tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isn't too much to complain about it's just a light easy going happy comedy and i recommend it
<START> late night on bbc1 was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress kelly reilly who is stunning to look at br br this is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don't know why you're laughing for me martin scorsese's after hours 1985 is the best example dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness i didn't spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised br br as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003 it all seems rather worthy it doesn't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back the script could've been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good i'm glad i watched it flaws and all tho i don't think i learnt much about ireland today especially their policing methods
<START> poorly done political actioner badly photographed acted and directed every single scene is including those very few that are shot during the daytime it doesn't matter what the location is at an important conference in the white house no lights are on and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows the of china conducts an earth shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of homer in a rembrandt painting honest it's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness the slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill thought out movie br br roy scheider and maria conchita alonzo do well by their roles but scheider is rarely on screen the other performances are dismissable there is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a bond movie who's accent suggests a childhood spent in basset nebraska and who should have remained the model she probably started out as whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like johnny depp not because of any display of talent the chinese villains representing both taiwan and mainland china hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes br br the script is pretty awful recycled from other better films there is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat two thirds of the way through the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs then the movie splits into two related parts part one another shootout this time in a waterfront warehouse part two an exchange between the vice president now acting president and the oily chinese premiere lifted out of both dr strangelove and fail safe we unwittingly launch our missiles they launch theirs in retaliation we cannot convince them that our launch was accidental even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles there is even the george c scott walter matthau general who argues that their can't match ours so we should hit them with everything we've got more fireballs br br the end comes none too soon
<START> a remake can be successful an adaptation can be successful it isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation br br a good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie regardless br br sarkar i am afraid was a very poor movie first of all just by making characters look dangerous or macho they don't bring in an aura about them br br what was so brilliant about amitabh character that we should have been in aura of his and what showed the of the character nothing br br this fact was said by a commentator and amitabh kept giving facial expressions now amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it br br there wasn't proper of the characters who worked under too just because a man had spectacles why should we assume he is wise the flow of the movie was generally scenes from the godfather were created like the policeman slapping abhishek bacchan the older brother being killed by abhishek like fredo was killed on instructions of pacino but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it that was indeed the problem br br if you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match never making the full impact watching a full match will make
<START> before seeing this film i suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator there have been many films about crime victims this one is about the murderer br br dead man walking finds realism in simplicity of the story there are no crack lawyers coming to save william and no dramatic story twists the film does not attempt to put him in a good light he is guilty he is repugnant is a racist and was responsible for heinous murders given all this we are asked to do something very difficult look at him as a human being despite his crimes in this way the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides justice whether you are for or against the death penalty the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption inequity in the justice system and the of the death penalty br br great performances by both susan sarandon and sean penn in particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of penn's ability
<START> irwin allen past master of cinematic schlock pulled out all the stops in voyage to the bottom of the sea a badly aged walter pidgeon who actually may have been dead when he played this role is the commander of an atomic submarine that must be the size of the empire state building every room is gigantic and some even appear to have no ceilings you could bowl and hold a formal ball simultaneously in some of these rooms the sub called the is on its maiden run when all hell breaks loose the van allen radiation belt catches fire and the must launch a missile into the belt by a certain time or the world will go down in global warming flames along for the ride are a bunch of truly terrible character actors many borrowed from tv this makes them tv hack the worst is probably that poor man's stella stevens barbara eden as a naval secretary squeezed into too tight clothes sporting high heels and acting like she's appearing in a beach party flick maybe that's because frankie avalon is also along for the ride a badly aged joan fontaine almost unrecognizable here plays a visiting doctor with a big bad secret but in truth who cares voyage is a truly bad movie obviously made for small children but what child is going to sit still for endless shots of a miniature model moving over and over again from right to left across the screen in what is obviously a studio tank there is not one scene where we believe these folks are actually aboard a sub when the shakes the actors fling themselves about sometimes in opposite directions to one another just like on the good old star trek tv series when the bridge shakes if i remember correctly not one fish or sea creature is seen except for an octopus that momentarily latches onto the sub a nod to 20 000 leagues under the sea the octopus if it was real was probably about a foot long and it shows worse when folks are standing at the glass nose the ocean they are supposedly watching is obviously a closeup involving an unseen air hose spouting bubbles probably filmed in a fish tank you have never seen bigger bubbles in your life you'd think these bubbles alone would smash the damned sub to pieces sadly a badly aged peter lorre is also along for the ride near the end when the missile is entering the flaming belt lorre is seen enthusiastically congratulating pidgeon while everyone else is still waiting for their cue to start shaking hands and embracing one another in victory a one take scene if i've ever seen one what a stinker it's not even good for a laugh stick with silent running
<START> dr franz a swiss scientist is smuggled out of his home country by sherlock holmes in order that the nazi agents spying him do not get his invention of a new bomb sight arriving in london he takes residence with holmes and watson but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend charlotte where he leaves a clue for holmes as to the locations of his bomb sight which he has divided into four pieces but holmes' eternal nemesis professor moriarity is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the nazis and abducts dr and the clue left at charlotte's a code series of dancing men which both holmes and moriarity are both unable to decipher completely holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight but moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable very good entry in the holmes series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about atwill's portrayal of moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the doyle stories or george performance in the adventures of sherlock holmes but atwill's skills as an actor makes his moriarity quite the benevolent fellow the script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well great job on the cinematography as well rating 8
