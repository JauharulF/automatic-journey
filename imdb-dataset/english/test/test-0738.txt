<START> i saw this film back in the early 70's and i was mesmerised by judy geeson for me it captured the clandestine nature of rod irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker played by geeson br br you couldn't help feel a little sorry for the wife played brilliantly by claire bloom i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvd br br i defy anyone who saw the film and it's strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main character performances and i would have loved to have seen it again if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reason br br going back in time some 35 years br br a real classic
<START> i am a fan of randolph scott westerns while some of them are amazingly clichÃ©d as are most westerns of this era his easy delivery and style really elevate the films to classic and near classic status while this film features yet another example of real life western heroes being exploited after their death by hollywood in this case bat masterson the film works well due to him as well as excellent supporting characters one is the always strong acting of robert ryan an excellent actor who is sadly almost forgotten today the other is the ubiquitous gabby hayes who has one of his best roles as the crusty and very colorful deputy here he is more enjoyable than in his many supporting roles for roy rogers and john wayne mostly because his part is better written and he's given more to do br br the plot is pretty much the plot of half the westerns ever made there are some baddies who hire a bunch of thugs to run roughshod over the locals and it's up to a do gooder scott to restore the peace and kill off the villains however how the plot is executed is much better than average and due to this the film is still watchable fun just don't expect a whole lot of innovation or uniqueness unless you want to see what might just be gabby best performance
<START> there is only one film i can think of that might be as good or better than this one when it comes to bugs bunny and daffy duck ali baba bunny however determining which is the best is irrelevant just watch them both and enjoy br br i compared this to ali baba bunny because both feature daffy at his absolute worst greedy nasty and very funny in the process however i think i prefer rabbit seasoning simply because bugs is also pretty awful in this one doing horrible things right back to daffy every time daffy tries a dirty trick br br the film begins with daffy leaving rabbit tracks right up to hole in the hope that a hunter naturally it's elmer will blast the rabbit and leave daffy alone not to be outdone bugs time and again takes all of tricks and turns them around and in most cases it involves daffy getting shot in the face it's all very very clever and funny and i don't care how old you are this cartoon will make you laugh unless you are a grouch i especially love the great and unexpected ending but i won't say more as i don't want to spoil the surprise
<START> this movie seems a little clunky around the edges like not quite enough zaniness was thrown it when it should have been but i mostly enjoyed it br br the storyline is more than a little bit preposterous so no expectation of something real should be included in your viewing experience check your brain in at the door it will not be needed and might be an impediment otherwise br br i quite enjoyed performance as the real dr his role was spot on for giving aykroyd's character a protagonist what a putz the real dr was br br and matthau was quite good as the lead character's sidekick annoying at first but ultimately lovable sort of kind of or at least something the use of a bar of soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpful br br actually worth watching if you're in the mood for a spoof on the psychiatric profession sure why not
<START> americans next top model is the best reality show i was entertained 99 9 percent of the time watching it i kept my eyes open the entire time well i did blink it can be sad funny or addicting mostly addicting america's next top model kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point it is also on more that one channel sometimes it's on mtv other times it's not i hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series it's great for pretty much all ages so every can enjoy it br br also if you watched the show before haven't you noticed that tyra has a different hair style each time in the judging room she'll have it short and curly one week and then long and straight the next
<START> this series is formulaic and boring the episodes are the same thing every week simply with slightly varied settings some purely evil character does some dastardly deed walker goes after him and it ends in a karate match the villains are super clichÃ© super stereotypical evil villains the good guys are all pure honest and saintly and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic after about 2 episodes the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans certainly not norris's best work his other work may be clichÃ© but it usually does not drag on for weeks if you enjoy formulaic boring repetitive clichÃ©d snooze fests then this is for you
<START> considering it's basically low budget cast this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer buddy holly gary busey stars as holly who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music backed up by his crickets holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with richie and the big bopper the film follows his rise to stardom marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death i like this film and believe that you will too charles martin smith also does a great job in this film
<START> kazuo komizu who hasn't made one decent film directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese release br br yes it does feature scenes of rape gore and dismemberment but so what it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers dirty debutantes and is incredibly slow br br it seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti social acts br br there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced br br just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this on the contrary that kind of fan myself for example tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning it's a shame production companies don't realize that br br one reviewer here commented that the film's near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it i disagree the subject matter is never the issue the issue is how that subject matter is treated in entrails of a beautiful woman it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring br br personally i like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior with an intriguing context if the material is well directed freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing this horror pink hybrid is woeful
<START> to start off this happens to be my favorite of the st os br br in addition to critical comments i'll throw in some more getting technical when the enterprise fires it's photon at a blind target they'd have to be mighty close to direct hits i believe in order to cause any disturbance much less damage to the vessel with the vacuum of space to contend with br br i had somewhat of a problem with the commander questioning his faith in the protocol or their leadership unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets outposts in the neutral zone that are not at war also i don't think commander would fall for the basic or simple tactics that kirk played such as playing dead or falling for the ploy that the subordinate puts on him about whether or not to attack the enterprise when it is playing dead br br on the enterprise i'm surprised that after seeing the method of attack earlier that sulu would say are they surrendering when it attacks the enterprise the first time br br funny how spock can only get the repair done on the weapons control right when the emergency is over br br also in the final attack i thought the vessel was too long so long that spock could run down a couple aisles and back to the weapons room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes i would have used at this point but i'm sure it had to do with the technicians and budget br br on the positive side it's a good drama played on the vessel in which to introduce us to the romulans great scenes with stiles telling a good deal of the human knowledge of the romulans also his conflict with spock is right up there i wished stiles' character would have stayed on the show for a while if for nothing else than the energy he added br br it's only in fun that i point out the negatives and goofs i'm sure there are more but for me this is as good as it gets balance of terror is always the one i place at the top in my st rankings
<START> this was the film that started that the cinematic love affair br br between the jaundiced eye crew and matthew ferguson his br br ability to portray relatively normal characters like in br br la femme nikita is counter balanced by his equally deft br br handling of weirdos like kane one wishes that he would only br br be given more roles bigger roles and other even more complex br br roles to assay to push the limits of his abilities there were br br four or five memorable scenes in this film and matthew ferguson br br stole two of them from far more experienced actors this film br br itself is good and it is worth watching on its own merits but br br ferguson makes it a little extra special his may br br eventually show what the career of anthony perkins might have br br been like if he hadn't been typecast as norman bates so long br br ago kane isn't quite as whacked out as norman and far fewer br br people saw love and human remains than saw psycho so we can br br hope that ferguson will show us some hint of what perkins might br br have been able to accomplish had he been allowed to do so
<START> i was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when i first saw this and i've never forgotten it i'm a huge joan hackett fan and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent i'm so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this naturally it's not available on any media it would be perfect to show on lifetime but because of its age they won't you never see anything there before the mid eighties i can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run rex reed reviewed it in the new york daily news and he said that it was like a throwback to the great hollywood films of the forties and had it been made then the hackett and parts would have been played by stanwyck and crawford think about that p s so sad that joan hackett left us so tragically young
<START> wow this movie really really sucks 'nuff said br br the story a psychopathic internet predator stalks and lures young men and women into torturous traps it goes like this kidnaps people they find him he becomes a changed man and is released on the world yet again reverts back to his old ways and starts the torture again the story is stupid it's implausible the characters are stupid they're implausible or at the very least way over the top it's got some very violent imagery and if you have a week stomach you might just want to stay away but than again even if you don't have a week stomach you might want to stay away it's that stupid br br the cast dee snider kevin gage if you're a die hard fan of twisted sister and dee snider you might find this one interesting since he's the writer and star of this film his acting is laughably bad and you can tell that he's the one that wrote the god awful script kevin gage well they say he's been in numerous other movies that i've seen but i don't remember him from any of them and you won't remember him from this these two sadly make the film they don't make it good mind you they just make it br br one to five scale 1 it's bad it's very very very bad in fact it's so bad that this movie should come with a clip loading pistol to play russian with
<START> like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity donna reed is a case in point br br i don't think donna reed ever thought that donna stone was anything challenging not to a woman who had won an oscar for playing a very different type in from here to eternity she was certainly better prepared to play wife mother and homemaker donna stone after having played mary bailey in it's a wonderful life br br donna was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband carl was not an idiot he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis br br though this was the donna reed show because donna's husband at the time tony owen produced it yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children shelley and paul petersen had that best selling teen record johnny angel which she introduced on the show she successfully made the transition to adult star most known for her role in coach as craig t nelson's wife br br but petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day the donna reed show dare i say got most of its viewers because of him it's forgotten now but petersen also had a best selling record my dad didn't do half as well as johnny angel br br now paul petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself so many of them end so tragically it's good work that he's doing br br the stone family was the quintessence of middle america they lived in a suburb near chicago they led wholesome lives mom and dad were always there for the kids of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew br br it's this series i believe was the model for the tv town of pleasantville where tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are sucked into br br i have pleasant memories of the donna reed show easy to take but not too seriously
<START> this movie is an example of small budget ineffective star cast weak storyline and poor entertainment this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die hard fans of bollywood movies i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das she is good sexy and acting well she definitely go up in her career our was all time good at his work atleast he has some good to the movie i didn't like for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie
<START> the film is a pathetic attempt to remake ingmar bergman's autumn sonata 1978 starring ingrid bergman liv ullman and erland it did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out br br it is time film journalists like mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking it makes me sad when potentially good film makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of hollywood and european films br br you've got to give the film maker something though the film he picked for copying is one of bergman's classics and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in european cinema
