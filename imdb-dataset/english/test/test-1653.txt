<START> this was chaplin's first all talking picture and the results are mixed the movie is a biting satire of hitler and mussolini their henchmen and their fanatical way of life especially regarding the persecution of the jews it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm br br when compared to chaplin's earlier works this is quite pale in comparison the sweet funny style of his silents in my opinion is far superior to his first talkie there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on if this was a silent it probably would not have happened br br i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance one of the most touching moments is obviously the speech at the end br br the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both chaplin's history and movie history it is flawed but chaplin is in great form
<START> ok firstly if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with this you really need to be a fan to get the gag br br the move is basically about snakes on a train lots of them br br there is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending which i wont spoil the gore effect are full on and real icky but the movie is mainly one big gory gag about snakes scaring the hell out of a bunch of people trapped on a train br br the suspense is built up well and there are some memorable and well composed scenes some of the acting is a bit hammy watch for the surf dudes but thats not really the point give this movie a go know what to expect and you wont regret it
<START> go to the video store and get the original i do not understand why hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it mostly martha or bella martha has a much better cast beginning with the heroine martina who convinced me much more in the role of the work obsessed perfectionist than the more famous catherine zeta jones to the italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt not fit for child br br in many ways the american version of the movie is a copy of the german original they just exchanged the actors however they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very believable to materialize a father for the little girl in an american context br br i was thinking about that maybe the father could have been puerto rican or cuban or mexican well there are so many guest workers in the u s take your pick but i doubt that any of them would have shown up to shoulder the responsibility as the italian father did in the original therefore the american movie leaves that part out but keeps the italian cook and by doing this the whole story changes in the original martha is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country br br the american martha is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have that edge the german movie has br br in the original the italian cook is not so good looking but much more charming the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and martha is more representative of a career woman in today's world than the watered down version we are presented in the american version and the whole opera music in the american version was very annoying i loved the italian songs in the original and bought the cd br br hollywood recognized that mostly martha was a great movie maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in english without subtitles in any case the original is so much better by the way this reminds me of another remake shall we dance is one of my favorites in the original japanese version and totally forgettable in the american version
<START> if you're even mildly interested in the war between the states this film is worth watching it is great historical story telling no flashing sabres no cavalry charges no carnage just the story of a sorry group of union soldiers stumbling into the farm of a confederate woman and her son and taking as much as their captain's conscience allows this quantity moves up and down as events unfold affecting his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his men and his cause ultimately he reaches a compromise that any of us would be hard put to top br br i appreciate the historical treatment of the war in kentucky a slave state that tried to stay neutral but eventually opted to remain in the union under mysterious political circumstances involving the detention of certain roughly half the soldiers from kentucky fought for each side but there's never been much treatment of what it was like to have lived there through those times this film makes a great contribution simply in the look and feel of the time and place
<START> another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose as the name implies this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they're still using them as usual ancient burial grounds can you say poltergeist have been disturbed by clichÃ©d greedy land developers building stuff br br the cgi if it had been better might have made the effect more treacherous looking but they skimped on the budget and it shows to comical effect the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like and it wasn't impressive the deaths are just poorly done again with shoddy cgi i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects as for the victims they look they're going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams it's always obvious who's going to get it a character with only a few lines shows up strange noises are heard cgi dots fly exit character repeat several times br br still there's a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable unfortunately the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on so it's used too often when he can't think of anything else for his characters to do overall it's pretty silly but i've seen worse this flick is cheap but it's oddly fun to watch
<START> poorly directed short film shot on hi def or betacam it appears it screams student film video all the way the premise is limited in scope and the short actually feels a lot longer than it runs some interesting acting moments and some decent production value but not enough to lift this film from the hole it has fallen into
<START> despite this being one of john cusack and demi moore's early films it is one even hardcore fans can miss unless they absolutely have to complete the collection i have rare moments where i can handle better off dead but this movie is ultimately worse i am just not a savage steve holland fan and he did both movies so if you don't like the cheesy random comedy and amateur animation steer clear of this one fyi even for the demi moore fans she can't sing and the 80s synthesizers did not save her there are too many predictable twists and too easy jokes i suppose if you want mindless entertainment or something you can leave on in the background and ignore while you do something productive then go for it otherwise don't watch this movie if john cusack or demi moore couldn't save it you know it's got to be bad they are the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1
<START> i love watching the jericho mile i mean watching peter strauss run the mile is like watching bolt sprint the 100 meter i think peter strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing no man alive can out race rain murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him i've watched the jericho mile of times and will watch it more great movies get watched more than movies that are not i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make it they are great people and i bless them all thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the clichÃ© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst harold and andy tennant make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies dressed up as hari dancing chanting and playing the tambourine unbeatable the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> the daily christopher had some choice things to say about this film among them watch it all the way through its 82 miserable minutes and i guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking 'have we really descended to this ' yes we have for if ever a movie testified to the utter cynicism tastelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make british movies it is this abomination continues aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear filthy minds and knuckles that the pavement when they walk this sex comedy is so sordid unfunny and that it is enough to put you off sex and indeed films for life before concluding sex lives of the potato men is not merely a truly vile film it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self gratification and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen normally i don't listen too closely to the critics but in this case was bang on the money this film goes beyond bad indeed it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be tw t in a brummie it's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the goodies monty python spitting image not the nine o'clock news and fawlty towers br br ideally sex lives of the potato men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire spin off the fat slags 2004 and the ill starred all saints vehicle honest 2000 in the celluloid graveyard but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule filling screenings and misguided best film ever raves from people who should know better so i must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the british film industry in all its wisdom has inflicted onto an undeserving world yes i really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead but i actually remember thinking it can't be as bad as the critics said it was but as god is my witness it was worse br br acting dire from start to finish special mention to mackenzie legs on a young man's body' crook br br soundtrack cut and paste mostly ska based lager lout friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy doin' the lambeth walk to a watered down imitation of the specials knob madness on every single comedy variety programme in the eighties and 'ace of by motorhead as the title music what the hell trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by the young ones indeed ever offered by any comedy show cheap shot way below the belt br br script written by a 12 year old who's just read every single back issue of smut and zit in one long red bull fuelled session surely c'mon no real proper worldly grown up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper and mark gatiss was in it mark gatiss the least annoying member of the league of gentlemen and goodies fan taking part in such a towering heap of fly blown cinematic excrement 'one of the brightest british comedy stars' not any more he's not on the subject of league of gentlemen somebody give me a pair of lead lined diver's boots and steve 'face like a collapsed pemberton and a long weekend in a room before i die please br br cinema british or otherwise just doesn't come much worse than this kent the headless eyes 1971 is a new wave masterpiece compared to this repugnant smut
<START> have wanted to see this for a while i never thought i'd be watching it in a damp square london with 15 000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys br br quickly that experience specifically a new departure from it seemed to suffer from the same problem the hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor the long structure was a chain of short ones i e songs produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was i'd go so far to say counterproductive overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve br br it is a very exciting film with editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and there's a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time br br super film which can be assessed irrespective of sound as that's how the finished product would have been conceived 8 10
<START> i'm a big fan of naruto even though i haven't watched every episode or read every manga br br i really liked the first naruto movie and to tell you the truth i was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good or action packed as the first mainly because this one in australia only had a pg instead of an m which is a pg 13 us or 12 uk but i was wrong thankfully the animation was more improved although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed and was very good especially in the fight scenes br br speaking of that let's talk about the fight scenes the animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining i especially enjoyed the battle with and the fight with fighting the shape shifting female warriors all the characters you want are here naruto sakura and if only was in the movie could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion and maybe they could have a passionate kiss in my summary at the top i say that this more as a piece of cinema than just an extended episode and it does the action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting overall this is a excellent anime film that is a must see for any naruto fan 5 5 10 10 50 50 100 100 alright i'll stop
<START> i can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the imdb website have i been issued with the special edition naff version edited by produced by bernard matthews this film should be housed in i'm sorry for all the uk centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted what on earth is irons doing in this film
<START> this is a thoroughly enjoyable well acted film it is funny and sometimes hilarious the finale is a bit disappointing since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package the film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes the jane austen staging the camping trip as examples b h does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes toward homosexuality and bisexuality most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity in that sense it is a joyous vacation from homophobic society and it is a celebration of a flexibility a loosening of rigid sexual categories perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come
<START> this is a movie with an excellent concept for a story but that got sidetracked but a large number of clichÃ©d sub plots hackneyed and unrealistic portrayed characterizations and performances and some frankly implausible and highly coincidental and not to mention convenient as plot points to move the story to its inexorable finish br br the lack of anything that marked the lead as actually gay other than some coincidental references to crow bar or that he's gay was troubling it wouldn't have hurt to actually show him do something even if it was just meet a friend for drinks br br it's worth checking out and has it's merits there isn't much even now a few years after the movie was released in the way of movies that feature both a lead that is gay or a significant gay plot line and that is also about african americans for that it's worth checking out i wouldn't look too hard for it and i wouldn't waste my time looking for it to own this is a rental and not a premium rental at that
