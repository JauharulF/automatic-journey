<START> heather graham sets out after her husband carl luke wilson who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl yet on the way discovers a lot about herself on her trip she encounters a bountiful of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way br br in my eyes this is a classical road movie which moves just at the right pace some viewers may find it too slow throughout the movie it keeps its humorous note while responds to the craziness of the world around her with a warm knowing sometimes sad smile all actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate 9 10
<START> telly savalas put on a passable but no better than that performance as pancho villa the notorious mexican bandit revolutionary in this account of raid on the town of columbus new mexico in 1916 villa is not really a historical figure who i'm overly familiar with so i won't say much about the historical details of the film as a movie this isn't great although it has a smattering here and there of both action and humour chuck connors' performance as colonel wilcox commander of the u s army base near columbus struck me as a bit over the top and clint walker as gringo sidekick scotty didn't really do very much for me the movie is obviously a pretty low budget effort of limited technical quality for a movie with a runtime of only slightly over an hour and a half i have to say that this movie dragged in places particularly in the last 20 minutes or so raid into the united states was an interesting if in the overall scheme of things not especially important historical sidebar and probably deserved better treatment than this 4 10
<START> i saw the movie in 1972 and like other people who have commented on it here i went back many more times to see it over and over i think 9 times in all just great is how i would describe it i was taken by the sound track the beautiful panoramas of the south of france the life style the kids began on their own an ideal way to live is what they had set up of course the powers that be have to intercede but when i forget that part i find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that so good that it is available on dvd now it was not around for years br br
<START> despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series and while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun i really do have to cast my vote as this episode as being the very best br br the movie interestingly enough is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts in so many ways the show is much like the film the enemy below where the american captain robert mitchum and the german captain curt jurgens are shown in counter point as they both try to outwit the other and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe br br interestingly enough only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull but because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well shatner and mark leonard as the leader oddly for the die hard trekkers out there they'll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock's father br br the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat
<START> i was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable though the mtv style of film making shot on dv to boot is quite an eye sore i liked the script's self mocking style as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer as to the cast eileen daly best known as the 'star' of those horrid redemption intros has an undeniable screen presence and is quite sensual despite her age however christopher adamson's hammy chief villain is obnoxious david warbeck has a brief role as a doctor dubbed the horror movie man who conducts the autopsy on one of the vampire's victims the film seems to have taken quite a long time to shoot as warbeck died in 1997 there's plenty of nudity and violence on hand but not much sense alas especially since its subplot involving a secret society of vampires infiltrating the power structures is barely developed the film is also overlong for its purpose and eventually slips into tedium during the last half hour
<START> closet land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors nothing more or less happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official the setting is minimalist this might be considered soft core s m porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time place and political context since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment the abuse becomes purely personal the pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman we come away disturbed but having learned nothing br br what is the point that torture exists in the world that abusing prisoners is bad that dictatorships abuse innocent people we know that already closet land has echoes of such works as darkness at noon and but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning this work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric a definite thumbs down
<START> this movie just didn't do it for me i like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror the effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake the same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex they could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects br br with lots of sex with as in all japanese movies this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this while bloodier for me it fits in with titles like purge and the series these movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals like toads eels and one look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere no horror here just sick and degrading sex scenes br br horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out guinea flowers of flesh and blood or even august underground while these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and absolutely fails in that department
<START> this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it it's more of a torture flick and it doesn't make sense to me there is a few scene's with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i don't think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didn't kill him the at the end she sets the killer's truck on fire that but he's not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
<START> i saw 'i smell the dead' sorry 'i sell the dead' at a press screening glenn the film's writer director editor is a laddish irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that whilst it was in progress he would be 'going out for a i don't begrudge him a drink but by telling us about it he seemed to feel he needed to his or his or both when the opening credits rolled there were as usual at press screenings loud for the names of every actor or crew member who'd got friends in the audience and silence for those who hadn't returned for a witty q a afterwards br br this horror movie doesn't take itself seriously which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror only one scene is even remotely scary and most of the 'horror' is merely gross out but i laughed throughout much of the film br br this movie appears to be set in ireland circa 1850 by which time grave robbing was mostly defunct the story is told in flashback we get flashbacks within flashbacks and the narrating character flashbacks material that he couldn't know about because sometimes he wasn't present or in one case because the action is unfolding behind his back br br the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine guillotines weren't used in 19th century ireland but for once we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence the prisoner struggles on his way to execution the rope cleats are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead and there's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself br br the characters are ostensibly irish but one major character speaks in cockney slang using phrases like a game and take a butcher's for 'have a look' for once actors in 19th century roles display 19th century dental hygiene yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles and the women's make ups are resolutely 21st century i'm not complaining in the case of heather bullock who wears a very fetching black miniskirt that appears to be pvc br br the lead actors except ron perlman are excellent but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period the worst offender is joel garland as the whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty first century just when i thought that garland's performance couldn't get any less victorian he used his fingers to make ironic air quotes br br the sets especially angus lab are detailed and impressive yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places nearly every interior contains burning candles but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or leftover from previous candles br br one scene features an extra terrestrial i was annoyed that plumped for a stereotypical grey alien rather than something original br br there are splendid montage sequences but opts for flashy effects split screens overhead shots that don't serve the story i was impressed by a recurring blue screen device the main characters' heads over other backgrounds less effective was a recurring style motif of camera shots morphing actors' faces into drawings resembling panel art from 1950s ec horror comics i'm a fan of ec comics but they don't belong in 19th century ireland the money that spent on flashy photo f x showing off his editing skills without serving the story should've been spent on accurate costumes br br big spoilers now ron perlman gives an oirish performance full of acting school tics ostensibly playing a 19th century irish priest he writes with his left hand in victorian ireland left handed children were punished for using the devil's hand and were forcibly to become but perlman's character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects so i knew there'd be a payoff later several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight apparently only because this was easier and less expensive since is a proficient director and editor he could easily have shot day for night but using a process photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques br br seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks but those hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 whitechapel or wherever 'i sell the dead' almost entirely fails to evoke the 19th century br br glenn shows talent as a director scripter and editor yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices then largely fails to justify those choices but i enjoyed 'i sell the dead' i'll rate it 7 out of 10 and i look forward to his next movie
<START> annie rooney lives with her officer father and brother tim in the slums of new york where she is constantly getting involved in many fights with the other neighborhood kids annie secretly has a crush on joe kelly whose little brother mickey is head of the gang that annie constantly battles who is in a gang that is headed for trouble says officer rooney kelly sponsors a dance where tony plans to shoot kelly in order to get even with him for making him look like a fool in front of his girl but officer kelly gets fatally wounded instead tim part of kelly's gang is told by tony and friend spider that kelly shot his father so he goes after him in vengeance annie learns of this and goes to stop her brother if she is in time very good mix of humor and heart in this film even though the plot doesn't start until the 40 minute mark of the film pickford is enjoyable even though she was 33 playing a girl no more than 12 13 and really gets into her character haines doesn't play kelly as tough as he should but is able make the audience feel for him on an emotional level the scenes where the officer tells annie of her father's death and the ending really put a lump in your throat the mix of all sorts of kids throughout the film are fun to watch rating 8
<START> i don't really consider myself a conservative so i wasn't personally offended by this film but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid or both the characters are one dimensional either good freedom loving americans or brainless greedy evil conservatives there's nothing clever or creative just anti conservative i don't really mind the political bias itself but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the movie and clearly it is br br on the positive side the cast is wonderful and chris cooper's impression of w is funny the first two or three times but after that it's just the same old joke being told over and over again br br so if you really hate the conservatives you'll probably enjoy this film but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that's less black and white then you'd be better off watching something else
<START> i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this books are wonderful and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor wake up hollywood not everyone thinks that your mel gibson's are cool many movie today want to see films that make you think i have seen all of the redford hillerman series they are thoughtful scenic and have great plots i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment if anyone get's a chance to read tony latest book do so it's great i also recommend traveling through arizona new mexico utah and colorado stop at every view site and feel the setting of books amazing experience
<START> i cannot hate on the show when the old and better tech tv had to hit the bricks the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in attack of the show is the replacement for the screen with 3 co hosts in the beginning they were kevin rose kevin pereira and sarah lane brendan moran came to be something of a co host as well but he mostly did pieces for the show kevin rose decided to leave the show and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host but that didn't pan out for some reason br br eventually i just learned this from this very imdb sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because hey this is what i read the two got married that was a big secret to me now there is a new female co host the not as hot my opinion olivia munn she's hiding something in those tops she wears while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it br br ahem sorry br br attack of the show deals with everything young people want to know about it's music movies comic books the internet and television this is what's great about the show if you don't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv you can get all you want on some segments and bits they do are funny they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names br br even though the hosts aren't as geek as i'd like them to be i still have found attack of the show to be entertaining even with its latest lineup
<START> yes this movie features a gal named jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too well she only causes a tree to fall once but she does say everything is evil this movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people but offers little else in the way of entertainment jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy of course they don't know this until the owner of the helpers open the box containing the head the head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body this movie has an interesting enough story but it plays out very bad here everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once
<START> let's start from this point this is not a movie intended for the common audience utterly bizarre somehow incomprehensible totally unpredictable it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next if that by itself doesn't make you agree it is an excellent movie then go back to your family movies and forget about it has material to be considered a cult movie it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals but sadly hollywood already let if fall in oblivion simply because it is not commercial the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material but he gives the right touch to the story even the genre is difficult to describe it is not a comedy in the proper sense you don't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have but don't let them watch it either it is not a movie for kids so if you like disney movies or are looking for a home alone style this one is definitively not for you but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton then you will like so jump in your red mustang get a tattoo spelling tora and cruise with gus i'd like that
