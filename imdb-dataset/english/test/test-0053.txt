<START> i am a huge amy adams fan and have been for many years i am also a big fan of musicals with that said this is not a good movie on any level it is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor amy adams is awkward to watch act with scott g anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting all the performances come off as very amateur the music performances are pleasant but nothing special br br scott g anderson is just an bad actor i assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice but it's just not the case he has an average voice and sings on key but that's about it br br i guess i can see why amy adams did this movie with the singing element i just wish she had not i could rant about other poor elements of this movie but i'll leave it at that
<START> thanks to the of a fellow imdb member i've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years and i can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick i can't believe that channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty br br it focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other as events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually thickens not dissimilar to shane meadows' excellent revenge chiller dead man's shoes the acting writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters yes it might be set in public school but it's worlds apart from anything put out by merchant ivory i got a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story br br this is a film that you'll remember for a long time if you see it except you probably won't because channel 4 or filmfour have chosen to bury it on their own official website they describe it as an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of channel 4 overlooked by who this was one of the very first channel 4 films which would later go on to become filmfour thanks to the success of films like trainspotting so somewhere someone must still have the master print in these days where you can get extended collector's issue dvds of more or less anything it's a bit moody that they can't give a film this good the promotion it deserves br br so if one of the channel 4 production is reading this stop making programmes that showcase people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal chase up this film and sort out a nice special anniversary edition disc or something please
<START> when i saw lauren bacall do cactus flower on broadway i never dreamed that one day i would see an actress like ingrid bergman playing the bacall role on screen but here ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be walter matthau's wife so he can go on with the he's told goldie hawn br br it's a story played for laughs from beginning to end good humored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time there are plenty of one liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on tv the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives br br as the daffy girl who contemplates in the beginning committing suicide over her unhappy affair with matthau goldie hawn fresh from her days as a star on tv's laugh in does a dumb blonde role to perfection easy to see why she won that supporting actress oscar br br ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part at any rate she's a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty br br as goldie's next door neighbor igor rick lenz acquits himself admirably and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene br br matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those neil simon roles he had a lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after lie br br it's the kind of rib tickling comedy that'll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that abe burrows and i a l diamond have managed to scrap together based on a french farce
<START> what is this its so bad the animation looks so terrible it looks like a ps1 type game the actors are awful they just cannot act to save their lives i sat through all of this film an then at the end i was annoyed when i realised i had wasted 3 hours of my life i've not heard of this film did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd a girl got shot what is up with that it was just a stupid film they totally copied 'the day after tomorrow' its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this you could spend your time watching 'the day after tomorrow' its a lot better well thats what i think of the film actually why have i wasted my time writing about it ah dam its really annoying me its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now
<START> i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend so when it wasn't as bad as that i was delightfully surprised br br unfortunately i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well and i was wrong br br apparently i'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad br br i don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw or wonder if i saw the wrong movie br br ed quinn as ellis and emmanuelle vaugier as alexandra morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them they deserve to be in better movies br br the special effects were okay and some of the characters likable hate able and that made for a tolerable watch but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time br br oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it aloud all the way through the movie did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms only once did it happen zombies wandering in and i found that a little convenient soldiers walk into a room leave the door wide open pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it with the hapless being cornered with no way to escape and yet only once did zombies follow them in br br nitpicky maybe but honestly if i was fighting for my life the last thing i'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me br br that is really the only thing bothered me throughout the movie and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original
<START> a sweeping and deeply moving love story featuring powerful performances from ralph fiennes willem defoe and juliette binoche br br it tells the story of a badly burned man ralph fiennes who gets pulled out of a plane wreak during world war two and tells his nurse juliette binoche his story br br just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful katherine clifton kristen scott thomas however she is married to jeffery clifton colin firth and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair br br a very haunting and tragic story of love and desire set against some absolutely gorgeous locations in the desert a must see especially if your a fan of anthony work but be prepared to shed a lot of tears its very moving especially at the end
<START> agreed this movie is well shot but it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made 2 hours seem like 3 just over a small love story br br this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the o c in short please don't watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you up from you're sleep i gave this movie 1 10 cause that was the lowest and no this is not based completely on a true story more than half of it is made up i repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10 but the movie is just a little too much the actor's nasal voice just makes me want to go blow my nose unless you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge no no
<START> thriller is brilliant it is a long video but simply brilliant nonetheless the song itself is excellent add michael jackson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon out of all the videos i have ever seen this is the best if you have not seen the video yet then i urge you br br the special effects are amazing for it's time everything from the transformation to the idea of these creepy zombies slowly raising from their graves is grand grand that is price has his segment of bone shivering lines known simply as the rap ola ray does good as michael's girl and michael jackson himself the dancing and singing although not during the video itself is unmatched br br 10 10
<START> who won the best actress oscar for 1933 it should have been laura hope for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever she truly is one of the great character actresses of all time she played the frivolous prudence in camille 1936 and her best remembered role is aunt in gone with the wind br br irene dunne was the official star of the film but her scenes with laura hope were dynamite br br david joel mccrea is in heidelberg when he is offered a job in new york his wife christine irene dunne can continue her studies at the centre their first stop in america is a visit to david's mother mrs phelps to say that laura hope dominates every scene is an under statement from her first entrance in a frantic burst of effort to greet her big boy all attention is on her even sitting around the tea table when she forgets existence even forgetting how she takes her tea you know something is not quite right hester has been living there for a while br br frances dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable hester her performance in this film especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under rated as an actress she was br br all the young cast are excellent eric linden is superb as robert the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell joel mccrea at one point says painting roses on bathtubs that's more your style there is a very subtle suggestion in the film of robert's sexuality br br irene dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried
<START> turner and friends are closing in on hbo for the top spot among made for tv movie producers this is a nicely paced contemplative thriller of sorts william macy is stellar as always and adam arkin offers one of his better performances a bit more lively than classic hitchcock but not as in your face as typical movies of its type a slight case of murder eases you in and never lets go note i saw a preview copy which means i didn't have to wait through commercials those interruptions may hurt the pacing but you know this will be available on video sometime
<START> where do i start first off the story sucks the acting sucks the effects really suck i guess i'll start with the story the story for komodo vs cobra number one it doesn't explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there or for that matter how it was created the acting terrible it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street which is probably what he did and last and definitely the least the effects they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic the water doesn't even move when the cobra appears all in all terrible piece of crap don't even think about renting it
<START> christopher guest is the master of the mockumentary werner herzog is one of many documentary greats out there penn isn't good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a mockumentary penn could also take a lesson from the the blair witch project even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created it seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down you're watching fiction in other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth in fact many early audiences watching it at sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real penn whose forte by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that documentary or mockumentary film making and it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film is obviously not br br penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a meta documentary penn however confuses the audience and loses their trust from the get go as he enters herzog's house before the filming of herzog's film enigma of loch ness about the myth of the loch ness monster a film which apparently was never finished Â probably because of penn's interference even though penn is apparently the director of the film we're watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying what is the film crew doing here and starts shying away from them he does this on a couple other occasions as well he will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between herzog and penn it seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally this leaves the audience scratching its head wondering who is in charge here if penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of this is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction br br penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world i think when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the loch ness monster but by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless br br this is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary penn's presence begins to and overshadow everything else in the movie br br the herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isn't acting we even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by penn much the way the audience is but you're never sure of even that penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary but he only succeeds in being annoying in a guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because you're never sure what penn is about as a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here perhaps its only redeeming quality an unintentional one at that is that it's a great example of why the audience is important and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice for that reason alone i think this would be a good film to show to film students Â sort of a what not to do kind of movie i have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long it's done skillfully with a thematic base to give it substance this film is completely lacking in that br br i'd like to call it a valiant effort at something but i'm not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time br br as a side note it seems like bad art always calls to mind good this film made me think of the book picture by lillian ross ross followed john huston around during the filming of the red badge of courage and brilliantly documented it for the new yorker it would make a great movie in fact if you want a great example of meta art read it
<START> i watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears i guess i just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that i remembered i watched the mod squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic it was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with greer was endearing there wasn't any of that here when greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less the actor who portrayed pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged pete in the television series was quiet and serious but had a funny side also they had this guy acting like he was either on drugs on the time drunk or just plain ignorant i wouldn't recommend this movie at all especially if you were a fan of the tv series it will be a complete letdown
<START> i can only think of one reason this movie was released to capitalize off the upcoming fame of guy pearce this movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes errol flynn's memory the homosexual encounter was pure speculation the disdain shown for flynn in this movie is palpable an easy way to slander an actor who died years ago horrible and embarrassing very disappointing don't waste your time on this utter trash watch my wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography this movie is not the way
<START> while babysitting at an isolated colorado house a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone br br remake of the 1979 semi classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span so it's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin there's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie there's a lot of camilla belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares it all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film especially since it wimps out and changes one important plot point from the original i guess we have the pg 13 rating to thank for that br br on the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub par belle's performance is pretty mediocre too br br it's just another unimpressive remake br br 1 2 out of
