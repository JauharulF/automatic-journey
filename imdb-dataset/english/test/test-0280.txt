<START> this short which won an oscar spawned two sequels and a tv cartoon show has minimal animation but script by theodore geisel aka dr seuss and more memorable and enchanting main character upa pioneered a style of animation that even influenced disney during the mid 1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s this is on of their finest god to have it in print highly recommended
<START> i'm starting to wonder if all these pg 13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent get a first time screenwriter an inexperienced director a few tv actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do 'when a stranger calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings but is still completely by the book riddled with plot holes and genre clichÃ©s br br the story is unbelievably simplistic the slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend the killer is devoid of even the token motivation of jason or michael or even the original movie's killer and as a result is never particularly frightening the police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct simon west brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with lara croft but his style of directing is decidedly generic possessing no of real talent or vision the performances are routine dark hallways replace genuine horror and the scares are of the tired cat in the closet variety br br the cinematography and production design however are above average for this kind of film the house is beautifully designed all dark wood and glassy reflections and there are a few moments that are of visual interest br br though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk
<START> i was wondering what possessed the organizers of the victoria film festival to include this film in their program i guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film i on the other hand consider it the worst film i have ever seen it starts with a bad script full of holes and dialog so unlikely it's embarrassing ideas are introduced then dropped with no development the acting left me totally cold and uninvolved the set decoration was appropriate for the time but a nightmare the only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly the attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years the photography was leaden and lacking in variety save your money for something worthwhile
<START> as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horrible br br i could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point br br i would have given this a 0 if possible bad acting bad directing bad production bad plot br br this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965 very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etc br br i rarely ever see a sci fi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a b movie this is the very bottom of the lot br br i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes junk like this gives good low budget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look good br br the thing about watching direct to video movies is just when you think you've seen the worst you see something even worse br br dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out br br avoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity
<START> the first season was great good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home it was actually a pretty funny show br br now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone and the whole thing revolves around the airline company even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill way too over the top where before it was perfect br br that and no more sarah mason one of the best looking girls in hollywood br br this is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show you can almost see the meeting the old man is funny lets focus on him make him way over the top and make it all about the airline it'll be a nutty version of the office anyhow no hot chicks no watch
<START> the subject matter was good direction was ok mohanlal was efficient in his role as a major the acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best the casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle jai was terrible he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics he did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier there was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle satellite is located hundred of miles in the sky so the only angle is from above it was quite an embarrassing moment audience these days are matured and they recognize when one is trying to pull wool over their eyes the director is a major so the story could be out of his personal experiences no problem there but the movie is only as good as its actors and director so if major ravi is going for any other projects he should pay more attention to the casting
<START> some of the films produced by roger corman's new world film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of b movie where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of freeing influence on the writers and directors Â such classic drive in films as 2000 hollywood boulevard grand theft auto and caged heat emerged from this environment unfortunately his former confederates at american international pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s particularly in the absence of jim nicholson and they often produced second rate imitations of corman's films sometimes featuring his self made stars black mama white mama is one of those films it's basically a cheaper imitation of the big doll house with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things yes this is a john ashley co production yes the same john ashley who was the hilarious elvis wanna be in how to make a monster and paired up with debbie in beach blanket bingo with all the signature marks of his productions Â women's prisons where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 lead characters including the inmates and the guards are filipino actors in mostly non speaking roles where we see supermodel type women taking on the roles of revolutionary militants and where the primary joy of the film is derived through rudimentary s m exploitation br br the print i saw most recently was horribly light damaged good ole will described it as yellow mama yellow mama but i think even in the best conditions the photography and directing are extremely routine there's also very little visual value hereÂ corman must not have had very much to do with the film itself because he was always canny enough to at least give his films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive this film doesn't look impressive it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a shred of talent the only remotely interesting performances come from pam grier as a feisty whore out to escape the life filipino actor fernando as her grotesquely self indulgent pimp and sid haig as a cowboy styled mercenary the story places grier and co star margaret markov in a low budget female version of the defiant ones but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities afforded by that premise it's basically just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while they're trying to escape the prison together this is all in the spirit of good fun but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation because there's a certain edge and rawness that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under this director's hand with a kind of yawning predictability br br so the film will have little value for fans of hard core exploitation value Â at least in the version i saw it's no more explicit than faster pussycat kill kill from over a decade earlier and far less interesting visually and thematically for those who just enjoy getting a laugh out of so bad it's good films this one might provide some fun but it's not in the upper tier people would be more advised to seek out caged heat or some of the others that revel in their own brutality to the point that it becomes camp this one is more similar to less ambitious efforts like santiago's the sadly the best thing about this particular film is the title and the presence of pam grier who was better in other films around the same time particularly jack hill's coffy this film perhaps illustrates a midway point in miss grier's journey from corman secretary to b movie queen for a day but other than its historical significance as such it will have little value even to grier's big fans because she is given very little to work with here br br worth skipping unless of course you get to see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like i did and even then its value is questionable
<START> this is a low budget well acted little gem alice a small town massachusetts teenager fed up with her existence takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market she sets out for florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at miami after her car suspiciously breaks down on the and she loses all her money she ends up with a retired couple in an rv who also happen to be traveling to florida the couple brilliantly played by judith ivy and bill raymond are overly hospitable and it turns out a prostitute and and her pimp slowly alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the rv meanders down the in the general direction of florida through intermittent flashbacks we learn a little more about alice and her desire to leave tiny milford we also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and alice all seem quite credible an excellent well made film that you will think about when it is over
<START> i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it for years i did not know the name but the movie stuck in my mind the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually it was a shame it did not make it to a series this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun also known as doppleganger if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch it was done before the stranger but shares a similar plot yet different i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs hope they make a dvd but it is doubtful unless it comes out on dollar dvd a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd's and maybe this one will
<START> first the premise stinks little boy likes to dress in girls clothes it reminded me of norman bates in psycho or ed wood in ed wood the jokes are lame and old you've seen 'em in a dozen 50's 60's films the whole cast is wasted i bet people signed on just to be in a shirley maclaine vehicle please would somebody tell shirley she did her best comedy in two mules for sister sara see it if there's no reruns of andy griffith on
<START> talk about being boring br br i got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the galactic railroad i expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material boy was i wrong br br spring and chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation it's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as which is something that i suggest you watch instead leave this bore alone if you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap do not pay top dollar
<START> this film is the smartest comedy i have ever seen a lot of jokes are either a parody of another film from star wars to dragon ball to power rangers to kung fu etc or somehow related to history of whatever otis creates the elevator a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun of because it was b c like the wheels of the horse wagon spinning other jokes are just plain total non sense but also hilarious like the famous scene with the dog running after the roman guy with the little music in fact in this movies they mix pretty much every kind of humor i watched this film 6 times already and every single time i watch it i find other subtle jokes like the scene where waldo is part of the egyptian crowd it is the funniest movie i have every seem finally a laugh out loud comedy that doesn't include toilet or sex humor is also what makes the movie everything that comes out of that guys mouth is hilarious this movie is nearly perfect except a few clichÃ©d thing like the fact that asterix gets his power back because he is kissed that is plain stupid but overall an excellent movie 9 5 out 10
<START> what a crap that movie is the script is simply non existent the movie at times seems like a music video but it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match pathetic way of combining action and rap one might think it being a recipe for a successful flick here it fails miserably dialogues in this flick just killed me the scene when harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful generally speaking recent seagals films are hardly watchable what the hell happened to the guy i know he's old but can't he get hollywood to drop him a decent script or something is he running out of dough for his escapades to india that he takes on anything they serve him
