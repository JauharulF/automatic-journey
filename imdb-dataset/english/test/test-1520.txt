<START> i'm astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left wing fervor could make such a subtle non sanctimonious picture if you're for capital punishment you'll still be for it after seeing this if you're against capital punishment you'll still be against it but whatever your stance is this movie will at the very least make you reflect on why you feel the way you do there's not one false note in the film
<START> the big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort and charlie chaplin was no exception this patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution although the war was nearly over by the time of its release the tramp goes to war humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the kaiser in the bum it's a very funny film although i don't think it nearly one of his best it's with 'a dog's life' as his better output for first national before he made his early masterpiece 'the kid ' they are his first three reelers which contain sustained more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his two reel shorts at mutual br br it can be difficult to balance a pro war message with slapstick antics and scenes of burlesque on the front but one wouldn't think so watching arms ' it's also preferable in many respects to a more serious dramatic work with a similar message such as griffith's of the world ' chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy by this time he makes it look effortless he knew very well by now that a film with fewer gags with more elaboration refinement and careful timing could be better than any knockabout keystone type farce with a dozen pratfalls a minute the sequence where chaplin is disguised as a tree is a pertinent example even with wars raging chaplin can lift the spirits of millions
<START> hitch is a light hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances will smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and dagger date doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession smith was excellent never it up too much br br the best piece of acting goes to the actor don't know name playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league this actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to smith's directions but in the end just can't help being who he really is br br and in the end that's the main message of this film be who you are in love and you'll be ok br br at the same time will smith meets this attractive lady and the date doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman don't know her name but she was pretty good too br br overall this was a delightful light movie that is definitely worth seeing
<START> i recently was in a stage version of this play and on the last day of the run i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night and i watched it the next day i have to say i was very disappointed the actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script that is understandable as the process is probably different but it was upsetting to see a lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen but i am not sure if it helped the movie out at all i gave this 4 stars only because i know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays
<START> i watched deadly voyage because david suchet was in it after enjoying him in the poirot series and joss ackland is always worth watching so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film alas it was not to be br br i won't bother critiquing the performances the pacing the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film others here have already given their opinions on those elements the only thing i want to address is the film's message since it proclaims in the intro that it's based upon a true story and therein hangs the film's supposed importance br br deadly voyage primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us because he believes that he can make money there nothing more nothing less his motivation is utterly selfish of course some people will by saying that he was doing it for his family but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in so he really just created his own problem to that end kingsley decides to stow away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york in the process of doing this he faces harsh conditions racist crew members and other challenges br br but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley simply because he has a goal goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company if he makes it to the us it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into and if he gets caught the shipping company will be fined 45 000 i doubt very much that any of the care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else they're clearly just out for their own gain he could've spent the 1 000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for legal passage to the us and applied for residency and a work permit instead he takes the illegal and dangerous route br br so since kingsley's voyage is illegal selfish and cannot be ethically justified why should we care about him or his ordeal simply because he faces challenges why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without because he's black and the shipping company is white the reason seems to be because danny glover the film's executive producer and others involved want us to root for kingsley as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage but once you accept that illegal immigration theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all you can't really care about him br br before anyone plays the race card i assure you that i would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity nationality the involved parties were imagine if a british person decided to stow away in a train headed for sneak across the border and collect unwanted buddhist antiquities to bring back to britain to sell how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate very little i'd bet so why should we feel different for because he's black because he's poor by american standards the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means and that a shipping company being fined 45 000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country i didn't buy it for a minute
<START> toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counter terrorist forces accurately just check out the end credits there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us army's delta force who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time once the president the posse act of us code the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time and even the use of an ah 64 apache for air support which might seem a bit over the top is not terribly unrealistic far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter terrorist forces with far less accuracy
<START> flawlessly directed written performed and filmed this quiet and unpretentious danish film is an example of cinema at its best and if a person exists who can watch babette's feast without being touched at a very fundamental level they are a person i do not care to know br br the story is quite simple in the 1800s two elderly maiden ladies and reside in remote jutland where they have sacrificed their lives romantic possibilities and personal happiness in order to continue their long dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served one of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a frenchwoman babette stÃ©phane whose husband and son have been killed in france and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate although they do not really require her services the sisters engage her as maid and cook and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined indeed the entire village admires and depends upon her br br one day however babette receives a letter she has won a lottery and is now by village standards a wealthy woman knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to france the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly french meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation the meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember but not for reasons that might be expected for babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her br br the film is extraordinary in every way meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them as the film progresses we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to god and their all too human frailties and the scenes in which babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful beautiful and incredibly memorable there have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of babette's feast which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul highly highly recommended br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> when i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about and i had never heard of it before but i must say i was positively surprised the first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie the store clerk from india is just too funny anyways the story isnÂ´t really too much to talk about but i think itÂ´s ok the acting on the other hand is quite good and still the only actor i recognized was mickey rourke who wasnÂ´t really in the movie until the ending and the ending is where the turn off is i think itÂ´s not bad but i donÂ´t feel like it really ends i feel like there should have been something more a final battle in some way i donÂ´t know all in all this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into tarantino type movies with loads of violence and dark sinister humor i rate it 7 10
<START> i don't understand why this show didn't go on there could've been various ways to continue on the line of darwin and after season 2 obviously darwin couldn't have been the uc agent infiltrating cells and them from the inside but still they should've given this show at least another season br br the show is well casted believable and views the islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view it touches controversial subjects in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowdays i'm actually sad that i didn't know about this show until late 2007
<START> 1981's just before dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there it's one of the finest made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like the final terror don't go in the woods or the prey out of the water br br a group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought however they are not alone in the wild a hulking in bred murderer who seems to be in two places at once is lurking and apparently hates trespassers br br director who gave us such great b films as squirm 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well the movie is nicely atmospheric with a creeping sense of tension and some strong suspense this film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic the oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by the crafty cinematography the music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the scenic visuals br br deborah benson makes for a great lead her presence was captivating gregg henry delivers a good performance as benson's lover and chris lemon provides some occasional charisma the supporting cast especially veteran actor kennedy also does quite well br br a true gem of the slasher genre that needs no gore to thrill definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike see it br br 1 2 out of
<START> one of the most sublime of american masterpieces morrissey opens the film by with his open mouth snoring on a pillow we wonder is he coming off a heroin high we just see his face then flash his body flash his naked rear i can't think of another film that used this flash blip form of editing so well to create a hypnotic druggy mood an editing method that works wonderfully as both pacing and style after that introduction when opens his mouth his accent is jarring we expect him to be some kind of soft spoken instead he's got the voice of a street thug morrissey isn't comfortable letting our assumptions go unchecked the lengthy opening is very sexy and playful it's a combination of martial troubles fascinating lip rubbing kisses and early morning sexual escapades it all kind of flows together if not always smoothly then emotionally realistically br br what i got from this was the same as what i got from the 400 blows when i first saw it this is like a 20 something continuation of that story there's a sense of camaraderie between the flesh sellers and the buyers when walks the street looking for men to fund his wife's abortion there's the feeling of a secret handshake as boys make deals with each other i never found it boring though nothing happens nothing happens brilliantly the boys hanging around as they do waiting for tricks the main trick that finds is fascinating to watch using greek descriptions and only touching his back a form of aesthetic body worship on the man's part it's also dreadfully funny i'm not talking to an empty bed am i it's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie in any movie i think certainly any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale when eyes seem red and swollen we can't tell if it's because he's drunk ashamed embarrassed or all br br the conversations in the film are cut up they don't matter the film is silent in a few scenes some of the most poignant and beautiful you may ever experience yet when morrissey chooses to include one the way he includes it we sort of piece it together it's startling such as one conversation between and a newbie hustler and neither of them ever mentioning the word gay or hustler what follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites as gets serviced this just after explaining to the newbie getting used to the job br br is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him both by his clients and morrissey he's less than effective as an actor in the sense of acting as performing but as far as revealing something he's incredible he's someone we immediately want to feel above yet we go through his experiences with all their complexities and we're forced to try and know him he's the kind of blank slate that we're drawn to but can't get a hold on and of course he's incredibly striking forgetting everything else this is partially a testament to the beauty of the male body gorgeous torso and permanently erect nipples br br the movie has one devastating scene but like everything else you can't really master it a girl says that she's been raped and her only self defense is in saying that had the rapist only asked for sex wooed her he would have gotten a better lay it's shattering the movie has feeling for everyone but even better than that it's not merely sympathetic it actually attempts to help us understand human beings and without ever dictating what it is we're meant to be understanding it neither looks down on nor glamorizes the people within the film it feels inclusive when we see joe's arm around a transvestite when he reads a letter he talks about not getting past grade eight at one point he's utterly charming as he pauses on a word then says and continues br br you can learn something more profound from the interaction between and one of his clients in terms of gay straight relationships than you can from any case study here we have the young boy who smiles his top lip disappears as he does so when a 30 something gym bunny korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair it's a scene that feels very profound this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself it's not two gay men together or a gay man paying a straight man it's something else you can't put your finger on questions of sexuality are beside the point never before has popping a pimple seemed as affectionate after sharing something with each other emotionally though with since he's there for money it's never apparent why he's there though he's never less than sincere which may be his most disarming quality so can you help me out the man says sure i don't mean my pants 10 10
<START> two things can happen when an ensemble cast is brought together either you are left walking out of the theater asking why ' or you receive manna from heaven a delightful comedy from the burton sisters whose mother not only provided inspiration but the screenplay itself ursula burton plays theresa a nun whose friend's and family had always believed she was touched by g d when money falls from the sky the clan use young faith that the money was gift from the heavens to allow all their dreams to come true years pass and we find theresa returned home to her native buffalo she comes to the realization that the gift needs to be repaid and calls together her friends and family academy award winners shirley jones louise fletcher and cloris leachman to return the debt before easter sunday the money has long since been spent and all the characters find themselves in financial difficulties shirley jones and frank gorshin are a husband and wife con team that teach the all important in life of how to dress for winter in buffalo and my personal favorite they expect you to take the silverware when visiting a restaurant the audience can only hope that if theresa does reach her goal that that someone won't run off with the money the movie teaches us that it is not money but ourselves that make our and other's dreams come true every action has an outcome not just for you but the community around you when looking into the mirror we see ourselves as we'd like to be manna from heaven answers the question of how other's can see the image we'd most like to reflect the burtons have done a superb job directing the cast to break out of their shells and create new and inventive characters in the day of multi million dollar budgets this low budget indy proves it is not the cash in hand but true talent that will draw the biggest laughs malick the american president just shoot me adds a special flavor to this already talented cast
<START> this film was made thirteen years before i was born but i still think it is the wittiest most harmless piece of fun ever made it simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb british character actors it boasts br br where to start alastair sim peerless margaret rutherford ditto the wonderfully innocent played to perfection by the imperious joyce the victor hyde brown a guy middleton special and the rest of the staff sum up post war middle class england to a tee br br the humour is sometimes obvious but it is of that special ealing variety and is never offensive br br i have watched this film more times than i care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time the storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school the magnificently planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy are priceless br br it's an old clichÃ© i know but they really do not make them like that anymore how i wish they did if you haven't seen it please do you won't be disappointed
<START> first a warning br br i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal series the source print looks to be in immaculate condition but the image is a bit soft suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video the framing is far too tight so all the compositions are terrible even the title of the movie is cropped i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version available br br mr and mrs smith is just a footnote to hitchcock's career br br in his lengthy interviews with francois truffaut in the sixties hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed norman screenplay br br in truth there is not much more that needs to be said br br it is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as it happened one night his girl friday and story carole lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of and spends most of the picture being unreasonable br br robert montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband but it is hard not to lose patience with him long before the end of the movie the audience is saying dump the silly cow she's not worth it br br gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged he is supposed to be a 'old family' southerner although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene which he otherwise plays very well he is an honourable generous gentleman so of course he is bullied and patronised by robert montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph bellamy character in his girl friday br br this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation but hadn't actually seen one for example a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on going comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap here all the comedy elements are just strung out like beads on a necklace this is screwball comedy by the numbers br br it is the same with the direction typically these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end hitchcock doesn't get this his direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly over written but under and slightly too long he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it they do ok br br hitchcock had a good sense of humour which he frequently used in his thrillers but he had no feel for comedy as a genre his later trouble with harry was also a misfire for similar reasons to this movie but at least he was involved in that picture here he is just going through the motions br br all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad it just feels a bit derivative over familiar over long and ultimately rather flat br br mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock completists only
<START> yes it feels and for the most part plays like an after school special for a slightly more adult audience alright maybe a teen audience but add in bill murray already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent a nice supporting cast and an unexpected sweetness about growing up and remembering those great or not so great days at summer camp and you get a heartwarming funny sleeper hit br br it does get a little too smarmy for its own good but that is also one of its charms when you hear the title meatballs and see the poster you expect a teenage sex romp but what you get is a yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp the and the of simpler times reminds me of a christmas story which i also love the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated the only movie i've seen that comes close is indian summer which i like almost as much as meatballs and also stars matt craven let's hope he completes the trilogy maybe he could come back for return of the meatballs and bring some dignity back to the franchise meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic br br meatballs is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time not really guilty either it's a wonderful little film that always makes me smile
