<START> this is the third three stooges short that the team ever made and like a lot of their early ones this is absolutely and totally hysterical now owning it on dvd as part of the three stooges collection vol 1 whenever i feel like it i watch this br br in this short film moe larry and curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone but boy they end up making a mess out of everything br br this short is another one of my all time favorite three stooges shorts i also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy and the three stooges are the kings of slapstick br br when i heard that it got nominated for the academy award for best short film i really became curious about this when i heard that it had lost i was very disappointed about it br br this short is one of the three stooges funniest by far i extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot br br 10 10
<START> this is one of the best action films i have seen portrayal of the tough as nails gentle mother was superb and samuel l jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through with his classic one liners sure there were a few holes in the actual story but this fast paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end br br i felt geena was a perfect choice for the role of sam charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie both samuel and geena were well supported by david morse brian cox sweet little yvonne zima and newcomers sexy craig bierko and melina this film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male female stereotypes as we see sam charly davis and mitch jackson hurtling from one disaster to the next br br while i and many others loved this movie it is fair to say that there will always be people that don't and that's fine each to their own i highly recommend this film to action fans for its hilarious scenes and fast paced action
<START> i saw this film yesterday on tv i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based in the opening credits it said this is a free adaptation of de novel i should have turned off my tv at that moment br br vera idea of free adaptation is turning a story about church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex in fact the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part which was only mildly referred in de novel and of course the name of some characters br br as of the characters in the novel and joÃ£o eduardo were victims of church's influence was seduced by father and all the time she was controlled by him joÃ£o eduardo her fiancÃ© was by the priests because he dared to criticize them in this movie seduces every one she meets and father is just another victim joÃ£o eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons br br vera sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of bad sex even worse her story was completely empty of ideas two wasted hours de surely did not deserve this
<START> two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film making the director and producer took a heart warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry br br the relaxed back woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war br br the acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by jonathan to the older brother played by ben allison and the powerful performance by the colonel played by ron perlman the performance was extremely well cast br br it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages
<START> i believe that this movie was a terrible waste of my time and i would know after watching it 5 times in class this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times no one can truly say that these things happened to the letter if anything the only good part would be the actors even tho that they were really really crap they were reading the script without expression quite boring i would rather watch play school so i would definitely like to never ever see this movie again in my whole life it is a complete waste of time unless you want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened back in 1981
<START> it's one of my favorites tv series a wonderful cast great screenplay and a out siding plot br br watching the routine of the kyle family is of great moments of humor and great comedy performers let's see damon wayans no commentaries he's one of the bests today se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke br br campbell her's paranoid and sentimental jay is just wonderful to see br br george o gore ii perfect for the paper it's impossible to imagine someone else as the adorable and dumb junior br br jennifer nicole freeman the egocentric claire found the perfect actress beautiful talented br br parker posey impossible to not fall in love for her br br noah grey this boy have future i'm sure of it br br i get very sad when it ends but this show will be in my mind forever michael jay claire junior we love you
<START> its almost embarrassing to say i even saw this movie i mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects lots of blood and gore some scary moments and a decent plot does house of the dead 2 do any of these things right no not one of course its not as bad as its predecessor from uwe and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me br br the dialog in this movie is notorious with such lines as what do you do for a living in response i kill zombies and i was never a disk jockey i was a soldier the special effects are embarrassing even for a made for tv movie i mean seriously the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack the army base in this movie is a parking garage with a desk and a open gated room this movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co ed locker rooms in fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school br br also why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models and for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie br br overall this movie makes even the worst of scifi channel movies looks fantastic
<START> sad really sad this movie has nothing hmmm well maybe sybil danning to keep you watching it also hurt my eyes to see linda blair in this exploitation flick she certainly deserves better br br so what's the story about let's see warden john vernon tapes the inmates in rather inspiring positions while prisoner sybil actually runs the prison and little linda must fight to survive sounds like a b movie huh it is
<START> the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie the acting was poor and the premise of sexual was revolting the effects were marginal at best there were no stand out performances amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween h20 audience the original was much more enjoyable and gratifying i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years 10 best so far it is at the bottom of my list don't bother with this one folks
<START> a powerful debut film from k that explores events in the life of a group of high school students each of them in crisis in one way or another the film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased each of the main characters is facing major which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide the cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion fantastically well done especially considering the youth of the writer director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script
<START> an unusual movie which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country but a twist soon turns the tale upside down most of the film hits the right buttons the story develops smoothly acting is solid sienna miller's drawl is priceless she really can act chemistry between both leads works and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time the mood which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times br br at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat alexandre paris
<START> okay you saw the film and i saw the film true if not there are plenty of plot summaries out there and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another br br the most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads their emotional honesty was as compelling if not more so than any performances i've seen in recent months i found i laughed cried and cringed right along with them and that's saying a great deal because i'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk br br as one would expect the story is rife with clichÃ©s and i suppose that's the achilles heel of the picture it's a story we've all seen many times before we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce rory though you may not know exact mechanics you know there will be a transformative friendship a bittersweet romance and a gut wrenching conclusion if it weren't for the strong cast and directing this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the hallmark channel's program schedule
<START> where on earth do i start with the mess that is darkhunters firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or tv screen and can only be described as a poorly judged stephen king rip off at one point the supposedly fearsome jack claims that carol the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing is as annoying as a in a burger i would be laughing if i was making it up but i'm not just as ludicrous is how carol originally came to have the power to see how people die a cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid what br br secondly for a horror movie it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever this may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark broad daylight not very atmospheric at all br br thirdly the acting is truly awful proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable jeff fahey is obviously on auto pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe bogart impersonation as barlow marlowe barlow we get the joke it just isn't funny credit should go to susan an actress i was not aware of she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other more experienced actors to shame br br at no point is it even explained how the human character can understand what van character is saying to her she obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages br br on the plus side one moment is well done the car crash involving susan the sfx are throughly believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded br br all i can say about darkhunters is that british horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown avoid this movie like the plague although the plague would be a lot more scary br br darkhunters 0 5 br br p s the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious it is a weak defence when some claim you didn't like it because you didn't understand it the letters after my name make a fool of you not me
<START> i'm watching this horrid film as we speak it is possibly one of the worst movies ever aired in my house i'm sitting here with 3 friends and they agree its not scary its not funny its not dramatic it contains nothing appealing whatsoever we are 49 minutes in the movie we've only seen 2 critters only one person has died this movie is one big letdown nothing about this horrible horrible movie has made me want to watch the rest i'm getting a movie hang over i hope that everyone who had anything to do with making this movie dies i don't just mean the actors i mean the director producers the presidents from the studio that financed this movie it is in full the worst movie ever it should make the imdb worst 100 movies of all time at number 1
<START> i'd love to write a little summary of this movie's plot but there simply isn't one if you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title you pretty much know the entire content of the film sex breasts exploitation female frontal nudity and women's prison 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more escape of the island women an alternate title that isn't even listed here clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman in prison classic but it totally lacks the brutality of one wip flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex director erwin dietrich surely can't compete with specialists in the field like jess franco or joe d'amato and he should have sticked to making ordinary soft core flicks the only aspects that slightly look like cult cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant president with fidel castro and the group rape of a minor girl by soldiers the girls are ravishing though and the ibiza filming location looks very enchanting
