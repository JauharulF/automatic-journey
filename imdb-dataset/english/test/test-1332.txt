<START> this is a very strange series with dean learner i really didn't understand the guests i knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because i guess i'm just that stupid i don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe i love the serious look that he's got going on its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol i also really like the suit and moustache thing he has got going on its quite hot he's insensitive which is one of the funniest qualities i also like the way he has of the programme it makes it seem more authentic
<START> the girls might be prettier if you're their or a faced onlooker what i'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non reaction to this effort the delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors lighting seems to be a problem too although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting and if you view this film be open minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject they are the above and below ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty louisiana mansion that's the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths then two of them disappear and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt eureka i just realized what one of those aforementioned special circumstances would be unconsciousness
<START> i saw this when it first came out and found it to be a work of some genius but i must confess i was clearly in the minority at the time br br for me the progressive lunacy of the proprietors of guest house paradiso just gets better and better throughout the film with one of the most hilarious climaxes to a film ever br br but i wouldn't recommend it to mother br br lovers of gross out comic book style humour will appreciate this movie there are subtle jokes hidden away but they are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan and are superb and the deadpan unsuspecting guests are also excellent
<START> this movie was beyond disappointment well acted story that means nothing the plot is ridiculous and even what story there is goes absolutely nowhere it truly isn't worth a nickel buffalo or otherwise pun intended
<START> freely from one scene to another from one story to another just like when walking from a shadowy path to an open place like the wind in the leaves from a tree to another how many different sounds just like when traveling people meet and tell their stories and then part forever who knows and just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time the human of the world takes the breath away br br i saw this movie with friends of mine not all of them liked it maybe were they too used to scenario based and ready made stories i don't know so this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the sun sparkling on the sea walking without any hurry in the hills or through the little villages listening to the growing grass which tells the stories of those underneath six feet under in the warm wind of summer
<START> this movie had an excellent premise and could have been a fascinating look at racism attitudes to women at work and male female relations in england early last century however it simply turned into a soppy love story but what was worse is that the love story was totally unbelievable the acting was for the most part poor the direction confusing but most of all the screenplay and the story were non existent the only thing i liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting i really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out
<START> what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it well they loathe it this is the movie equivalent of marmite br br i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed it's fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as such br br i was always fond of the monkees especially the t v show back when it was repeated during the 80's my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on t v late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about 2 decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope
<START> chris ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain much as i did when watching it without her this would be no more than a cheap kids' movie but at least she does add an air of quality there are few if any more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business br br there's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is a cheap disney re make aimed at very undemanding children i could watch ricci all day so i'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings but unless you too are a ricci fan a cat lover or very small child i doubt you will find this very entertaining
<START> the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman she is a war widow br br the set is limited but the acting makes up for this robert ryan is conflicted one moment he seems nice then confused about where he lives at first lupino tries to help him he seems troubled but nothing more dangerous but how do we know the suspense builds i truly enjoy films like this which rely on the human element for suspense what is this man capable of there are some scenes with o z whitehead and dee pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong we keep thinking she will be helped then ryan's personality turns again he becomes like a jekyll hyde character and eventually chases lupino with a knife br br worth watching for these two superb actors 9 10
<START> let's see there's a civil war a lost city a talking gorilla some regular gorillas a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla the most powerful laser ever known to man a lot of diamonds lying mined and loose in the sand attack hippos an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed plane that's not too much is it i've had more coherent fever dreams and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something but then the mean gorillas that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular gorillas and as a kind of earthquake or volcano started the woman industrialist doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fiance's hand it's a blast if you're looking for more ammunition against the pernicious influence of michael crichton in american entertainment and hence world entertainment and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half hearted attempt fell on its face at the but sadly the men responsible crichton john patrick shanley director frank marshall probably never lost a dime shame on them and i mean that 1 10
<START> i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters and i saw it in japan the film's plot wasn't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore but i went to see it for the 3 d process it had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it though it never screened at the post theater br br the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later 3 d films br br i don't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler but you've been warned if it is in many films of the time actors would often work in front of a rear projection screen where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage this works well on regular films but when seen in 3 d they look like a flat scene behind the actors there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used and it didn't work well in the theaters if seen in 3 d it will constitute another disappointment br br the film's only importance is historical since it was the first of its kind
<START> three words what a pile two words don't bother one word sucked there are zero reasons to see this movie even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie the martial arts the typical aikido are horrible the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his kill move to his victims worse yet is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles how stupid seagal's acting was plain stupid but i still give this movie a 6 for acting because of the supporting cast whose villain roles were actually quite entertaining br br the plot is just dumb seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time at no extra charge and nothing stands in his way not assassins political leaders explosions or even death br br i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it no one should bother with this tripe br br
<START> many have disparaged never say never again because it is not an official bond movie nevertheless it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful bond formula although the film does not have a pre credit sequence it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene it would have been impossible for eon to stop the producers from including a pre credit and title sequence albeit without the gun barrel introduction br br sean connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr no thunderball you only live twice and diamonds are forever although is meant to be a remake of thunderball it is a vast improvement 007 spends more time on terra and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film br br there is some resplendent acting in this movie barbara carrera is impeccable as the bizarre blush one of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between bond and in nice which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city klaus maria brandauer plays the psychotic largo and max von sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying have indulged in br br tends to centre on connery rather than the character of bond at the commencement it is stated that bond is ageing and has been out of action this seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in connery's portrayal of bond bond promises never again to work in the secret service an allusion to connery's portrayal of bond it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise br br nevertheless this film is definitely worth watching this is the last time that sean connery played james bond but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said never again
<START> if i could give this movie a negative rating i would the humor is the cruelest i have ever seen in a film horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own there are 2 plots neither of which supports half of a film where is the depth others see in this movie that no good deed goes unpunished that only the heartless can succeed the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a bowie knife is a real thigh slapper if you thought schindler's list was hilarious then this movie is for you
<START> this was a great show i don't remember much about about it but remember watching it and loving it i remember the mother and the father i really like the grandmother she was like a grandmother you really couldn't appreciate until you became an adult she was very knowledgeable and no nonsense my favorite song on the show was in the morning that might not be the title i remember after seeing that show and hearing that song that i went to cleveland ohio to visit my cousins and me and my sister sang that song so much that by the time we left all of my little cousins were singing it too i too would love to find this on dvd
