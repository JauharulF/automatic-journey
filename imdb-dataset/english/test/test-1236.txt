<START> anna christie 1930 released 2 21 1930 viewed 3 10 06 br br on october 24 1929 black thursday the stock market crashes now the country and indeed the world will look to hollywood for escape from the worldwide great depression br br births anne frank june carter bob newhart barbara walters doris roberts ed asner dick clark roy e disney gene hackman br br doug at long last our odyssey resumes in earnest with greta garbo's first sound film a simple character study called anna christie an excellent performance from ms garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them how odd one thing i noticed over and over was the way the swedish accent sounds like replacing the letter j with a y sound anna ends up being the only character i liked i didn't really care for her estranged father or her would be suitor it looks like the sound recording systems are getting better nobody leaning in to talk into the mystery can but the camera still isn't moving we'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues br br kevin our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet greta garbo anna christie this is a very simple movie with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time often with a static camera it was great to see marie dressler in sound as well and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs i very much enjoyed garbo's performance as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments i didn't really like george marion or charles bickford maybe because i wasn't sympathetic to either of them so i was relieved and excited when anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't belong to either her estranged father or her muscle bound irish boyfriend it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound br br last film viewed speedy 1928 last film chronologically the love parade 1929 next film the blue angel 1930
<START> armored br br the best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money you can shoot them in the face br br and while the armoured guards in this thriller aren't using their protective power to purge the drifter population they are using their position to fleece their employer br br when newcomer ty columbus short lands a job with an armored trunk company he feels like he has found his lot in life unfortunately however when he discovers that his co workers matt dillon jean reno and laurence fishburne are plotting to take the 42 m shipment for themselves ty must fortify himself Â and the funds Â inside the armored truck br br a tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned in performances armored is an utterly forgettable film br br besides if you really want to jack millions it's a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an atm red light
<START> miss cast away is an amusing trifle which dispenses with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps has had a few drinks most of the jokes are current event based so in future years this film may become a time capsule of turn of the 21st century pop culture references br br the to conversion of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts most noticeably the opening aerial shots br br the appearance of micheal jackson is indeed a strange non sequiter event but i for one find it encouraging that mr jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his protÃ©gÃ©s even after he the director has passed from the cute preteen boy stage br br the effects work is not as bad as one review suggested most of it was done by a one man crew in a brief span of time consisting of animator william sutton whose name seems to have been omitted from the imdb credits his work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie i hope he's finally been paid
<START> a desperate attempt to make a film noir sci fi thriller but the movie falls short it has no believable plot some of the key actors were a joke not lars bom he is cool i did like the access restriction by though i finished it on principle but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life
<START> this is movie is actually one of my all time favorites i'm not a renny harlin fan because most of his movies suck but hits its mark time after time is about a woman named samantha cain davis who suffers from amnesia she is married with a kid and as she i'm a goddamn member of the pta and then her world comes crumbling down as the pieces fall into place about her earlier identity samuel jackson plays a con artist cop who does pi gigs he is dragged along by her to solve her identity and to get paid some cash for his work along the way we find out samantha is really charlie baltimore a secret spy that was left for dead years earlier the plot is great making this story seem real and jackson does a great job as second fiddle to davis whom always does a great acting job the explosions are endless the action is intertwined with memorable scene after memorable scene pretty impressive visually though the kid got on my nerves at the end watch out of the cars i'm tired of little kids screwing up a film to be saved but still this movie is worth it as the kid adds to the film again this movie is really good i never understood why it didn't make more at the box office but if it was a man starring in the movie i'm sure it would have grossed a hundred million what is good is that over the years more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks as the average of this film on this site has risen over the years i hope it goes up further as this is one great action film and i love action films
<START> with the terrible acting the awful dialog the multitude of bad humor the crappy plot and over terrible film this has to be the worst film i have ever viewed in my life and i'm the king of finding bad movies for the effects they just threw fake blood on people and things didn't spend the time to create wounds and make special effects worth anything most people making low budget horror flicks at least do something like of tissue or something to make a wound the dialog was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort they just threw some actors on a set and said have at it i swear i've seen better films from my film i class at school how did this ever get a dvd release
<START> the evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture all inside what a washout of a movie there's not a single scary scene not one richard crenna overplays a nothing role there's some animated ghosts a disfigurement by power saw and a ghost rape after nothing special happens for almost the whole movie the evil gets personified into victor buono great where did the filmmakers get the idea that buono is scary he looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his liquor bill by then its too late to turn it off because the damn thing is over i felt like throwing the videocassette out the window please avoid this junk hopefully it will never see the light of dvd and will fade into obscurity
<START> this movie has been a favorite of mine and is entwined with the christmas holidays for me for two reasons 1 growing up in the 1960s everything was space related from advertising to television programs and even santa claus found himself in spaceships during that era and 2 i saw this movie during a christmas shopping trip when i was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite tv shows when i was even younger fireball and stingray therefore i am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons br br that said as a long time student of film this is mainly a movie for fans of gerry anderson and barry gray oh that gorgeous score whereas the casual movie watcher will be put off by the future vision from the past dig those wild cars commercial aircraft clothes etc and the so called plot twist which will cause some to groan however if you can look past the post 2001 a space odyssey desire to make a science fiction film with a far out story line and if you enjoy imaginative special effects then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual 21st century
<START> my friends and i have often joked about movies being in real time but this movie really is they will literally show 4 minutes strait of nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with his hands it has no plot and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming i honestly don't believe that it won an award for it's alleged suspense if you are like me and saw the first film and loved it for it's horrible acting accidentally hilarious one liners and all around low budget ness it won't matter this is so bad it's bad memories might even rub off and taint any good memories you have of the original you would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen
<START> of course i'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen br br i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate it took about two or three days as best i can recall br br webb and don were serious and businesslike br br during the filming of our short scene which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old webb was very conscientious about getting things marine things right and he did a good job with one exception that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses never happen for a host of reasons br br i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force no brag just fact br br what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done br br the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language when the di was made cursing wasn't allowed on screen br br despite the lack of profanity it's still a great movie to rent br br br br fi do or die
<START> as someone who usually despises ali g ali g was absolutely brilliant when i was watching it i was in a hysterical fit yes it is sexist rude and extremely crude and i loved it as some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes this movie was laugh a thon i have never seen a comedy as original as ali g for a comedy starring ali g this would be worthy of an 8 out 10 absolutely brilliant
<START> this has to be the most boring movie i ever sat through it is dreary and drab has no excitement the acting by hulce is terrible as hulce cannot pull off the proper accent required for this film the story is stupid and i sure wouldn't recommend this crap for anyone unless you want to die of boredom
<START> the psychopath 1973 a trip down memory lane i saw this film many years ago on a old black and white t v a children's' show host mr avenges the brutal abuse that parents inflict upon his kiddie fans mr who looks like he's always on the verge of losing it finally cracks and decides to go on a hunting trip watch out bad parents cause mr is on the prowl what happens next is priceless however trying to find this movie will be quite a chore br br what makes this film notable was the fact that joe maniac spinell made a short promo reel for a film based upon this one in his unfinished film he plays mr robbie a t v clown who looks like a pudgy out of shape edward james olmos who avenges his young fans child abuse by going after their parents sadly mr spinell could never find the funds to complete the project the film was going to be titled maniac ii mister robbie or robbie the similarities are all too close for comfort pretty violent for a p g movie br br recommended
<START> this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary it has some very gory pieces in the film but not bad enough to make you sick in this one he has a female doll companion hence the name if you liked the first three then you'll love this go watch it
<START> if you're interested in learning about the 'real' side of spying this movie is for you unlike 007 movies this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage timothy hutton and sean penn both give outstanding performances in this not so well known film certainly worth watching
