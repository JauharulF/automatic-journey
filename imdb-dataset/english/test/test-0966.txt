<START> if i heard the male lead say this is madness one more time i would have barfed the film is one big cliche with fake grind him under your heel attitudes not one male in this movie has one redeeming quality reminds me of soviet era films with strongly politically oriented messages i couldn't even understand why there was attraction between the leads nor could i wait for the ending
<START> we all know that the world is full of dodgy rip off horror films some of these can be fun to watch due to their stupidity awful effects and iffy dialogue but raptor which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it its so poorly done it is really unbearable even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no brain day at home where do we start well the sets are pretty drab my old drama group created more realistic stages the genetics labs look like they are from a university and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside even for cover up why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all next up in the complaints list is the creature effects well what can i say absolutely pitiful also i think it's worth mentioning the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob jobs and it brings the characters down being one female is a respected member of police whilst the other is the sweet innocent daughter of the towns sheriff the acting though is by far the worst tragedy eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something thats where it ends corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic whilst the female lead looks so bored though with this film you could let her off the other character i'll point out is the daughter who lets her tits do all the acting in the raunchy sex scene ten minutes of endless re run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke br br all in all and summed up as one don't bother just don't
<START> maybe this was an important movie and that's why people rank it so highly but honestly it isn't very good in hindsight it's easy to see that chaplin probably all of hollywood was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos so you can't fault him too much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer but the disconnect remains br br more disappointingly the movie is just clunky it's as if chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era the set pieces those involving both the jewish barber and the dictator don't flow into each other they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts moving somewhere but never arriving at resolution some are funny some less so br br what charm the movie has is strictly in the person of chaplin himself his parodies of hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing and there's no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch but virtually everything he surrounded himself with was annoying hannah was too damn american the storm troopers were too damn american br br oooh oooh one more thing i don't know what purpose was served by having garbage be the source of evil behind the throne it almost seems like the film is saying that if it weren't for malign influences like garbage wouldn't have been that bad a guy
<START> i cannot remember a more trivial mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake it seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations no real substance to it all happy and shallow yeah that'll please the masses well not this member of the masses what a trivial load of drivel i wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start and to think i paid Â£7 to see this i think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days so i like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what
<START> for a movie i was really looking forward to i was very disappointed i had no expectations of this being another amadeus but did expect a more significant portrayal of beethovens last years br br the performance by ed harris was superb but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity br br the only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th and from that point on i could quite happily have walked out without finishing br br i left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed
<START> black eye 2 outta 5 stars unimaginatively filmed '70s action movie looks like it was made for tv only the occasional cuss word and a subplot about lesbianism tip you off that the movie was actually made to be shown in theatres fred williamson plays a tough guy ex cop who becomes a tough guy private eye he stumbles upon a couple of murders and attempted murders linked to a mysterious cane there are some fistfights a bullit inspired car chase a fairly original elevator scene and even time for williamson to confront the rich lesbian lover of his girlfriend teresa graves there is also a scene with williamson bullying a poor old man by tearing up some priceless old autographed photos in his memorabilia shop yeah way to go tough guy maybe you can find a cripple to beat up later obviously meant to cash in on the success of shaft this and about six thousand other movies this movie doesn't have enough edge or enough originality to make much of an impression
<START> this is definitely an excellent show i don't have cable so i started renting them because my friend recommended it i thought it would be a teen soap you know who's dating who that kind of thing but it was not it is surprisingly deep it is also very witty it moves at a very fast pace and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it it is a comedy drama which is rare when well done it is about rory and relationship instead of the classic mother daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship about a mother and daughter the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across
<START> if you haven't seen the first one you have to at least know someone who has and you have to know it was painful to sit through there just wasn't anything good to say about it at all so what's different with the second one why bother making a sequel for a movie that was wretched this one doesn't take itself too seriously it knows it was made for tv and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue there are moments where it tries to get or but these moments are so corny you have to laugh br br thankfully gone are any elements of uwe boll and any hint that this originated from a video game other than the title of course don't go into this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends unless they're into camp lame zombie movies or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie take two shots whenever ed quinn's character mentions his dead brother take one shot whenever a bullet would have been better place in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest etc etc
<START> the tv ads for this movie showed the warlocks hitting a truck head on then getting smashed to bits and reforming on the other side of the truck i thought the special effects were good but the general style of the movie was wimpy this is the charmed tv series with three boys instead of three girls br br the big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and consolidate all their power besides driving into trucks these kids can fly up the sides of houses climb out of windows push each other into stacks of garbage and make the veins in their necks pop out but if they use their powers too often they become prematurely old and feeble the father of one of the boys is evidence of this as he sits in an attic made up to look like a mummy but he is only 45 years old br br the three good warlocks are each filthy rich in his own right completely spoiled obnoxious and annoying in any public school these kids would be beaten up every day their glares and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the boys from the hood unfortunately for all good people these charmed boys were sent to reform school for the warlocks that couldn't get into harry potter's class br br so what was the movie all about three teenagers acting out with each other and their girlfriends one other teenager who envies their power and money and happens to be a lost relative after a few scenes where the charmed boys show off their powers and have sex with their girlfriends the movie gets around to the unknown warlock teen's revenge plot the predictable stuff happens the bad warlock ambushes various friends of the other warlocks and eventually starts attacking them too the final confrontation happens and that is about it br br the special effects are not bad but nothing special if you like to see fireballs spiders and blue veins then this is a good movie to watch
<START> i'm glad they finally released it on dvd i bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year br br has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success its formula is certainly not original but it's very funny nonetheless i am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings br br it ranks as one of my all time favorite comedies it's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good and sometimes that's all a movie is meant to be
<START> i found my tape of this long forgotten 'show' besides the theme song beaver from outer space' this show is barely watchable you will be flipping through channels just like the couple flipping through the tv channels this is a parody of tv br br the beaver is cool the homosexual dracula the chick discussing her experiences and the lady with the overly big lips discussing homosexuality show us everything that is wrong with tv it is all bad just like the beaver from outer space who seems to be lost in this new world you will be too out of
<START> as someone already said the living dead dolls were cute and if they came out as a new series of wicked little things i would buy one or two well basically this film was dark not in the scary sense but in that i cant see kinda way and it was boring three females in a house the youngest told not to go into the woods under any circumstances well that didn't sink in and it would have been better if that advice had involved their death and doesn't anyone do any cleaning or whitewashing or something you would think a lot of coughing would ensue a sexy young mum where you waste your time trying to figure her age by my calculations 34 or 36 and it looked like it had been longer than 20 years since someone had lived there so what was with the fathers young adult photos on much older album i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast teens getting stoned and drunk in car and well you know where that leads death and apparent deafness too as tim seems oblivious to his friends scream i mean i have pushed many a car where the instructing driver did not scream and i heard them clichÃ© weird man in the woods who no one believes plumber who has lived in them there parts for years and this is his first experience with said children so that driving along he avoids wielding youngster in dead of night run him over you idiot clichÃ© roaming about in woods without a clue about where you are going armed with knowledge that pick axe wielding kids yes them again are out and about senseless scene the of pig why do so many directors see no problem with animal mutilation and slaughter i would have much rather seen the kiddies run up and bit people on the thighs than this zombies don't appear to have that much energy in other films the villain well how ineffectual was he his big part was in the shop in and demanding to be served first what a none eventful man he was why not kill him earlier before the family got there and avoid the movie being made or remake it differently i give my marks to the house the woods and the little goth i want one
<START> just what is the point of this film it starts off as one film then changes track cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other schlock horror flicks you've ever seen the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris screenplay by tarantino direction by rodriguez two guys who have previously shown talent but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it but it doesn't quite work that way you're only good while you continue doing good things there are so many questions to ask just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy Â utterly ruthless and efficient Â and it would have been interesting to see where that was going but of course we never do and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character that's not clever or witty that's just bad bad work keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout and no wonder did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go ahead tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant and why did he as writer assume we would find the rape gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny on every level Â except the technical Â this film stinks avoid
<START> the title refers not to a questionable poker hand but to six comic players they come in twos charles and mary boland as a couple driving to california for a second honeymoon george burns and gracie allen as another couple who go along to share expenses and w c fields and alison as a sheriff and a hotel owner in a tiny nevada town no attempt is made to fashion a coherent a collection of comic bits strung together all the first couple want to do is spend time together but burns and allen's characters aren't married so the men bunk together as do the women there is a bit of a plot a bad guy plants 50k in the suitcase pinky is taking out of town but because the expedition is being guided by gracie the loot cannot be found the bad guy shows up in nevada and fields accidentally captures him a bunch of pleasant bits confused expression gracie's batty breakneck talk and fields playing billiards with a corkscrew cue and doing a fluttery craven backwards stepping double take when he's threatened and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering over words and trying to remember the name gracie he tells hmm starts with a k she answers oh no no no no mmmm no no no no no oh gracie yes that's right
<START> this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by daniel boone in the wilderness of gap while being threatened by hostile indians a treacherous frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while boone tries to convince the indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes although somewhat violent for its time the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good especially lon chaney as the indian chief bruce bennett is okay as boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods
