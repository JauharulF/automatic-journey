<START> i recently got the seven ups on video and i must say it was a very enjoyable movie roy scheider and tony lo bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young richard lynch is great as psycho henchman moon the late bill hickman is pretty good as his associate bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats the other three members of the seven ups team are pretty bland but that's only to be expected br br i'm glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie i think it should be a film that should be released on dvd and not just forgotten i certainly enjoyed every minute of it the final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions the seven ups does not disappoint
<START> albert pyun delivers a very good action drama about a junkie who tries to rip off a big crime lord a lot of style and many very cool actors burt is excellent
<START> the cast played shakespeare br br shakespeare lost br br i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so good br br is it because 'the scottish is my favorite shakespeare i do not know what i do know is that a certain rev hence tried to do something similar in the victorian era br br in other words you cannot improve perfection br br i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it
<START> and also a wonderful beginning a real quick start it keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come unfortunately the high adrenaline dries off quickly but most certainly after half the movie is over br br and it's a shame because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly but that is also one of it's faults by exploring too many things it get's mixed up into to many things so in the end you're too confused to follow any plot or characters it's very dark and moody but that doesn't help much if it's also genre hopping just to try to fit any and everything in it's story
<START> better than average world war ii era who dun it featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight crime doctor's courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems the link to courage is not particularly clear br br this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr labels murder hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage as a mystery novelist jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime br br spooky houses with creaking doors caskets in the cellar and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good direction production design and photography stand out the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average b detective thriller br br strongly recommended
<START> how poor is this movie well i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about br br i also paid a Â£1 for this on dvd the old story of 'put a new cover on the box and some fool will buy it' syndrome all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved then again guess you could know that from the film's title br br straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap jack dvd as it is now this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around god bless the dawn of the dvd age
<START> sure the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time in that sense the movie has indeed dated but as a satirical look at america's number one parasitical industry advertising it's still on target but just as important is the counter message namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially promoting war toys alcohol etc thus the movie's also about the allures of capitalism note for example how garb suddenly changes to resemble third world revolutionary fidel's just before he pulls out of the firm for a moment it looks like mini revolution has succeeded among his staff and he's moving on maybe to spread the movement but then the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head perhaps to hijack a plane to cuba downey's final word however is an ironical one as the arab i believe burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of advertising capitalism a smoking ruin to me this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of message consistent with the radical spirit of the time br br whatever the subtext there are some genuinely funny moments especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then those who compare the anarchic style to that of the marx bros make a good point the throw away lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous set ups forty years later it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on despite the however the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments
<START> so well done the photography sound music and the performances were the best it's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene i loved it and i'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy each character seemed to fit their part to a tee it's the best performance that i've seen from ms capshaw she's been in more movies than i thought but this was a wonderful achievement i suppose it's a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically two of the cast have successful t v shows of their own now it's easy to see why tom selleck does his usual good job
<START> this film is strange even for a silent movie essentially it follows the adventures about a engineer in post revolutionary russia who daydreams about going to mars in this movie it seems like the producers know the communists have truly screwed up the country but also seems to want to make it look like they've accomplished something good br br then we get to the martian scenes where everyone on mars wears goofy hats they have a revolution after being inspired by the earth men but are quickly betrayed by the queen who sides with them except it's all a dream or is it and given that the russian revolution eventually lead to the stalin dictatorship it makes you wonder if it was all allegory br br now i've seen good russian cinema for instance eisenstein's battleship potemkin is a good movie this is just well silly
<START> for some perverse reason best known to themselves these imdb boards seem reluctant to credit the great billy wilder as co scriptwriter on at least two this one and ninotchka of his early classics when any buff can detect the wilder hand at work as it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with charles brackett who does get a credit and it was a great start one commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old fashioned cinemas and i couldn't agree more in paris one of the smaller revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous lubitsch retrospective and i'm pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though i doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938 the famous wilder schtick the meet cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but careful with it cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the riviera and meets with sales resistance until claudette colbert turns up and agrees to buy the other half the gag is milked even more when having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he too is only wearing the top half of pajamas the film is full of sight gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect claudette colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from edward everett horton as her impoverished titled father david niven in fourth billing has some funny as does franklin pangborn and if gary cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well you can't have everything and what you do have is darned near perfect
<START> dr chopper starts shortly after teenager robert adamson mum has died he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica crisp three friends jimmy butch hansen reese chase hoyt tamara ashley mccarthy head out there for a fun weekend unfortunately things don't go according to plan the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed their neighbours turn out to be dr chopper ed brigadier his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments br br going straight to video dvd dr chopper was edited directed by lewis this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews while i think dr chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i don't think some of the criticism i've read is entirely justified the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt whether he likes it or not who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i can't remember any character of that name maybe he was one of the cops at the start anyway the basic story is alright i suppose although it's a tad dull lasts for too long it's typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast you know the drill by now besides some brief undeveloped nonsense about dr chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there's not much story here the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off there's the inevitable sex scenes there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing oh when i say topless i mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in dr chopper at all so there you have it really it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted is populated with poor clichÃ©d dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes girls in bras to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i'm just being picky br br director does ok actually this is by no means the worst looking film i've seen although it still looks cheap there's no style here i didn't think it was scary there's no atmosphere either the gore is restrained restricted to some dead bodies severed limbs there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects dr chopper is also one of those films where character decisions motivations are ridiculous br br technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits the acting is alright it could have better but i've certainly seen worse br br dr chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace
<START> i don't much mind the factors that others here have objected to acting lighting and so forth for the most part these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across it's just a horror film after all br br what bugged me were the points themselves because this is a deeply moralistic film and its morality is deeply tacky in fact it's actually fundamentalist christian morality and this is a fundamentalist christian film look at the 'sins' br br sutherland's character picked on a kid at school when he was a pre teen leading to his accidental death br br baldwin's character used masculine wiles persuasion and good looks to shag quite a few women some of whom he videotaped ooh the swine how unlucky for him that women are such passive gormless creatures that they had no complicity in the matter br br roberts' character's dad came back from vietnam a junkie so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself yes what a terrible sin why couldn't he have just become an alcoholic like all the others br br and bacon's character picked on another schoolkid how awful the fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for nought children it seems are divinely judged by adult criteria br br well maybe lots of people support this level of moral it certainly seems to have gone unremarked in this movie's comments does everyone just buy this stuff at least human laws treat children differently from adults recognising that their ethical sense is partially formed this film has no such qualms and i find that pretty objectionable ditto the notion that women are helpless fluffy creatures before young men's evil lusts or that a vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option pathetic
<START> this could have been a very good film a very interesting look at ancient tradition and oral history but it should have been a short subject as it is it moves at a snail's pace sure that's part of the life being portrayed but this was unbearable i fell asleep watching them make soup and that was a highlight
<START> cujo is a giant lovable gentle and affectionate st bernard owned by the family during the opening sequence cujo chases a rabbit over fields and through a local wood somewhere in castle rock maine the rabbit disappears into a burrow and cujo sticks his head into the entrance hole the rabbit vanishes from sight angry cujo starts to bark and in doing so inadvertently wakes up and annoy a colony of bats one of which bites him on the nose donna trenton dee wallace stone as dee wallace is having an affair with steve christopher stone dee wallace's real life husband which her husband vic daniel hugh kelly who works in advertising discovers obviously their relationship becomes strained happily oblivious to all of this is their young son tad danny joe ed lauter fixes cars for a living out of his barn on his farmhouse joe is planning a guys weekend with one of his friends gary mills watson when his wife charity lee wins 5 000 on the lottery and decides to take their young boy brett billy jayne as billy jacoby with her on a trip to see her parents arriving at gary's house to pick him up joe finds him dead on the floor he goes into the kitchen to call for help and his dog cujo who is now rabid attacks and kills him donna and tad drive to the farmhouse to try and get her car repaired the place is deserted except for cujo who is now completely rabid foaming at the mouth his fur stained red with blood and maddened by pain cujo attacks the car to try and get at donna and tad luckily for them the windows hold firm at least for the time being anyway donna tries to start the car but it has completely broken down they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come and rescue them cujo lies in wait ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path directed by lewis i thought the film was a bit slow for my tastes the first half plods along the second half builds up a head of steam but i still felt it was a little underwhelming and unexciting the acting is fine by everyone involved i've no complaints there technically the film is ok photography music special effects editing and it's generally well made the big problem is the script by don carlos dunaway and lauren and in particular it's first half most of which appears to be padding to stretch the run time out clocking in at just under the 90 minute mark it felt longer it's also a little predictable as well cujo as a monster never really scared me either i just don't find slobbering overweight st scary i guess i suppose there's nothing really wrong with it but i don't think i'd be in a hurry to see it again average not too bad if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on t v for free
<START> the silent film masterpiece battleship potemkin 1925 was commissioned by the soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the october revolution of 1917 ironically the film's director sergei eisenstein was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a approach to film art subsequently eisenstein's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on socialist realism influenced by the russian film lev and through him by d w griffith's intolerance smuggled into russia in 1919 eisenstein constructed his films from a collision of rapidly edited images a montage of shots varied in length motion content lighting and camera angle without question the most memorable illustration of eisenstein's stylistic approach and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history is the odessa steps sequence in potemkin br br in structure potemkin is a five reeler divided into five narrative parts an organization clearly derived from the five act arrangement of western drama in men and maggots eisenstein dramatizes the pre revolutionary oppression and discontent of the working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny even before the sailors and their upper class officers masters are visually introduced eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea onboard ship we witness crowded conditions eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings harsh labor and most memorably the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal the ship's physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup boiling like the rage in accordance with marxist the church also fails the men and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from the lord's prayer from two different camera angles in perhaps the first deliberate jump cut in cinema history br br identified by inter titles as drama on the and an appeal from the dead potemkin's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution united by appeals to brotherhood the initial are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by eisenstein's editing techniques the officers' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed the ship's doctor is thrown overboard accompanied by dramatic to the maggot ridden meat and his eyeglasses dangling in the rigging tragically death is the price paid for the revolt no omelet without breaking eggs and he is laid out with dignity on an odessa pier hundreds of ordinary odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge death to the oppressors shots of fists clenching and signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness br br the complex and unforgettable odessa steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act it begins with uplifting music and a series of close ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects parasol eyeglasses baby carriage suddenly as exclaims a title card in huge letters the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps here eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting below the mise en scene is framed by a statue of caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom symbolic for russia's oppressive institutions monarchy and the orthodox christian church br br punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children in the first a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the first victims the boy is shot but the mother continues running until close ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd with a much slowed editing pace the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers shown only in a diagonal shadow line they summarily shoot her dead after this lull the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach the womb of mother russia as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage in a scene famously imitated in the untouchables the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom when the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a wielding a sword and a classic effect suggests what we do not actually see the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent the final series of shots in the odessa sequence is of three stone lions one in repose one sitting up and one roaring the editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people's awakened rage br br somewhat the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet they and the viewer expect retribution but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years but that quibble aside battleship potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era and it retains extraordinary cinematic power
