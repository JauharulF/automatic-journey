<START> just been on sci fi channel uk 5th july its was shame on may be he was bored one week he cant be after lotr i suppose he wasn't to blame mr was i turned off after 50 minutes couldn't bear it the cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat who funded this project i think the whole thing must have cost 250 bucks avoid at all costs don't think about buying the dvd if they release one i cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one lets hope someone makes a decent film and a decent bigfoot movie sasquatch was okay poor lance its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it no more super hero films please
<START> what can i say about this movie except that it is great fun br br john cusack plays hoops mccann a recent high school graduate who has two choices learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at with his pal george calamari played hilariously by joel murray and his zany friends br br when i say zany believe me it can't get much than the stork brothers egg bobcat goldthwait and clay tom villard and ack ack raymond curtis armstrong throw in a little girl named squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by demi moore and you have the makings of a split your sides laughing movie br br the laughs flow freely in this movie and the story line though the typical good versus bad and good conquers is great with the twist of a regatta as the showdown br br i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time if you like to thoroughly enjoy your movies then you can't miss one crazy summer
<START> this is a very cool movie the ending of the movie is a bit more defined than the play's ending but either way it is still a good movie
<START> my sister a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of september we had all seen the first jackass movie a while back and we all enjoyed it we were really looking forward to number two br br we were not disappointed br br from start to finish i was laughing hysterically it is equal parts shocking and amusing however and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches it is obscene but it is also groundbreaking american cinema well perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their stuck to ice sculptures but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not things that no other decent american movie released nation wide would dare show us br br there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene and it involved a horse i'll not elaborate br br i laughed i nearly gagged and i came damn close to crying out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball not sadness in my humble opinion jackass number two is the film of '06 br br does that make me a jackass perhaps but if it does i could really care less
<START> i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it but beyond that the show's whole format is incredibly annoying even though a lot of it seems scripted the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use big words they obviously don't understand and head investigator ryan's ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window and he looks stoned all the time in short this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists
<START> unlike some movies which you can wonder around and do other things this movie kept me in front of the screen for the entire two hours i loved every minute of it br br however i have to say that the story is not very believable especially when the foreigner was expelled by the government and then later on actually sent a package to the guy who helped him xiao liu is a very good actor he shows his emotions and he shows his silliness and his love toward that girl
<START> this has to be one of the most powerful message sending movies i saw lately it was absolutely flawless all the way amazingly original and thought provoking story is unusual and original and the characters make this story very very powerful it's about a guy who kills his ex girlfriend's retarded kid brother and as he is sent to juvenile prison through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don't let it go until the very end murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more it's a total tour de force cause those actions cannot be described by simple words his motive of committing murder is left explained and it makes viewers think acting was pretty much flawless and the cast was very good it contains many familiar faces if you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them e g 'mulholland dr ' then 'the united states of is an excellent movie choice for you otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for serious thought provoking movie br br 10 10
<START> based to some extent on writers david croft and jimmy perry's own experiences as butlins holiday camp entertainers in the uk during the same the programme follows hi de hi epitomises the postcard humour of post war britain set in the fictitious seaside town of on sea hi de hi chronicles the comedic goings on within the holiday camp one of many dotted along the british coast owned by the mega rich but never seen on screen joe br br although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988 when the bbc deemed it too tame for it's cutting edge comedy department seasons 1 5 focused on 1959 while seasons 6 9 spotlighted 1960 a time when the old style british holiday camp began to fall into decline during the first 5 seasons jeffrey played brilliantly by the late great simon was the camp's entertainment manager a well meaning yet slightly pensive ex university professor breaking free of his upper class background and venturing into the real world to head his team of entertainment staff who were in stark contrast to his own laid back personality from season 6 onwards was replaced by clive dempster played by david griffin when quit the show at the height of it's popularity an ex raf war hero who in many ways was similar to character in background but more a scoundrel than a gentleman br br however the real stars of hi de hi throughout the nine seasons were ted played superbly by paul shane a stereotypical working class ale drinking bawdy comic someone who could never resist an opportunity to fiddle the campers gladys pugh played by ruth who's currently experiencing a career comeback with appearances in the hit bbc comedy little britain chief what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow jackets and sports organiser but more importantly the one person who saved jeffrey and clive dempster from embarrassment by covering up their inexperience in running a holiday camp peggy su pollard the slightly dopey yet lovable lowly maid with a burning ambition to become a and spike dixon jeffrey holland ted's innocent protÃ©gÃ© learning more about business' than he hoped for br br as usual with a croft perry production the assembled cast of characters were a bunch of misfits played superbly by the actors involved mr partridge played by the late leslie who was in his 70's by the time he left the show the alcoholic child hating children's entertainer fred felix a former champion jockey with a dubious past yvonne barry stuart dianne holland barry howard the snobbish former ballroom dancing champions who were in the twilight of their careers and sylvia and betty nikki kelly and rikki howard the two main girl who were always looking for the type of fun joe would never allow in one of his camps br br hi de hi typified the slapstick era of the late 50s with it's saucy and to a certain degree vulgar tongue in cheek humour jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about 'women with big were the order of the day but despite it's whiff of carry on it was always so innocent and became something of recommended family viewing back in the 80's of course the critics of the show remarked that the show had it's welcome by a good couple of years but i disagree while the early seasons focused mainly on and slapstick humour the latter series of hi de hi saw more thought put into the scripts and the main characters especially spike dixon gladys pugh were able to grow with more sensitive story lines that said there were a few criticisms of the show clive dempster was no jeffrey and the former didn't quite have the on screen chemistry with gladys as jeffrey did i personally think it would've been more believable if gladys had married jeff five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters weren't explained properly especially with the who came and went with much regularity and the character of gladys pugh who in the pilot episode was made out to be a free loving man eater that was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin like character also to mention quite most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one so to stretch the rest of the year out in five further series was something bordering unbelievable still the show wasn't meant to be meticulously looked upon and the comedy more than outweighed it's flaws br br all in all hi de hi was probably one of the last comedies from the bbc's golden period and even if it never managed to rival such british comedic mainstays as only fools horses porridge or even last of the summer wine hi de hi will be best remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy if you haven't already checked it out for yourself i implore you to do so
<START> this eloquent simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father though a theatrical release it has a made for tv quality we can attribute this to the director john frankenheimer who learned his craft in the early days of live television in new york city indeed he directed the teleplay on which the film is based deal a blow on the cbs drama series climax young stranger represents his hollywood debut after a hiatus of four years during which he would do more television he returned to direct the young savages with burt lancaster and a year after that all fall down with warren beatty and angela lansbury br br the casting is competent with james daly and kim hunter particularly good playing the parents of the title character performed by james macarthur his first theatrical film who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen look for james gregory and whit bissell in supporting roles
<START> this is from much of the same creative team behind better off dead but is not quite as good as that amazing teen comedy its a lot of fun but its all over the place and just not quite as funny curtis armstrong is used to less effect he was incredibly funny in better off dead bobcat is hilarious cusack is good demi moore is demi moore only with better hair here overall its fun and as a person from cape cod it catches the feeling of an 80s cape cod summer very effectively for some reason this film feels more mainstream than better off dead there isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here again if you are a fan of john cusack and savage steve holland its definitely recommended
<START> the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen the original film was shot inside a studio br br for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him paramount decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget this is shot on location in and london and has two big international names for box office this was james stewart's third of four hitchcock films and his only teaming with doris day and her only hitchcock film br br i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock favored possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his blondes br br doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who befriended them in morocco stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene but doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once br br day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in morocco and they make the acquaintance of frenchman daniel and the aforementioned english couple bernard miles and brenda is stabbed in the back at a market place in and whispers some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london their child is snatched in order to insure their silence br br for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother the song was que sera sera and i remember it well at the age of 9 you couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956 it even competed with the fast rising elvis presley that year que sera sera won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in 80 days it became doris day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back br br in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax br br instead of doing it with mirrors hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed it's choreographed you'll be hanging on your seats during that moment br br this was remake well worth doing
<START> the very first talking picture has returned from oblivion and now you can hear it and see it in autumn of 1894 at the edison lab complex in west orange new jersey thomas edison's associate william dickson tried to combine two existing technologies the phonograph and the kinetoscope to record sound and image together in the event dickson was unable to the playback of sound and image so this experimental film was never released to paying audiences and consequently unlike many silent films which dickson made for edison at this time it has no official title the silent image recorded at 40 fps has been in the library of congress for years known to film historians as a mute curiosity it was also known that the had been recorded on one of the crude wax cylinders languishing at the edison national historic site although nobody knew which one br br but now that's changed recently located the wax cylinder which had broken into several pieces these were reassembled a playback was obtained and the sound was digitised hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor walter cleaned up the background noise and tweaked the to make it synch with the film image which had digitally compressed to 30 fps sound and image are synchronised at last br br the film begins with an offscreen man's voice calling 'the rest of you fellows ready go ahead ' the unseen speaker remains unidentified but was probably assistant fred ott on screen dickson plays a violin into an immense funnel mounted on a tripod one of edison's sound recording devices while alongside him in full view of the camera two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing to the tempo of music br br the film lasts barely 17 seconds just long enough for us to marvel at this crude technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men waltzing in each other's arms speaking of which here's a warning a well known but extremely inaccurate reference book 'the celluloid closet' by the late vito russo includes a frame enlargement from this movie and identifies it as 'the gay brothers' that's incorrect 'the gay brothers' is an entirely different movie made by dickson at the edison lab during this same period 'the gay brothers' never had a soundtrack it's a brief fiction film about two brothers who are not 'gay' in the sense russo meant it the deceased mr russo for his own reasons wanted us to perceive experimental sound film arguably the first movie musical as an artefact of 19th century homoeroticism hmm what is it about gay men and musicals sorry but there's just no such content here br br this important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10 i've often maintained that no 'lost' movie should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed i'm delighted to report that this film is finally available to audiences as its producer intended it more than a century after it was filmed
<START> i just managed to find a copy of mission cleopatra which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the united states so far i have only watched about the first 10 minutes of the film and i can safely say that i laughed more in those 10 minutes than i did watching the entirety of the first live action asterix movie br br i am watching the dubbed version and while the dubbing job is a little disconcerting i have found the movie to be very funny and true to the book i see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version that may very well be true and after i watch the subtitled version also on my dvd i may have to come on here and alter my review as it stands though i find it to be a very entertaining movie and it more than makes up for the mess which they made out of the first movie
<START> if someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into and asked what i thought of jamie foxx in the title role it would have been time for a blank stare after all what is this fictitious person talking' about that wasn't jamie foxx up on the big screen that was ray charles this is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years like the soundtrack jamie as ray is flat out brilliant br br the blind genius of soul who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with r b died during production the movie about his troubled life is good not great taylor direction and james l white's script follow the well worn biopic outline super talented youngster battles adversity achieves greatness while also self destructing then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending the film shows charles' flaws heroin abuse chronic womanizing persistent bastard fathering even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music br br kerry washington and regina king play the main women in ray's life one his long suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress both actresses match foxx stride for stride what takes him to a different level though is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician the entire cast is effective especially sharon warren as his headstrong mother and curtis armstrong as a music exec stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and better yet more starring roles br br i was not a ray charles aficionado before apparently the film has left out a lot as do all biopics but this picture functions as both an old fashioned crowd pleaser and a dark investigation of a brilliant troubled man for those who whine that foxx doesn't actually sing as if that somehow diminishes his performance take a hike no mere actor can sing like mr charles anyway you can't have everything what the talented star does in this picture is about as close to everything as we'll probably see for a while
<START> i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me later i found myself lost in the power of the film how do you repay a gift from god the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race what more can any film do hollywood i hope your paying attention america does like positive upbeat films
