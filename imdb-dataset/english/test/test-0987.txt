<START> first and foremost i'd like to state for the record that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie embryo when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses animal as well as human aged 12 16 weeks the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase okay in all honestly i didn't know all this but i took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of embryo could have done don't worry i'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter as there are several more reasons to state why embryo is a huge failure actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light years of void filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and at the same time teach them useful little trivia about science in order to make a good or at least halfway decent science fiction movie writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule don't be boring if they can't fulfill this one condition the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelson's embryo the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies there also were some very prominent names involved in the production like main stars rock hudson giant seconds diane ladd chinatown alice doesn't live here anymore and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics soldier blue and charly then what went wrong simple the script is irredeemably boring clichÃ©d and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with br br rock hudson in a very poor performance plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals' fetuses he manages to keep one fetus alive impressively its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog because his procedure is so successful dr paul convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate however and after only a couple of weeks she's a full grown ravishing and super intelligent woman the good doctor naturally falls in love with her but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog that second half of the film does contain a little bit of grotesque action and suspense but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci fi idea there are some really cool scenes most notably the chess showdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall in a highly memorable and ultra obnoxious supportive role the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller sci fi cinema the last sequence including the horrible freeze frame shot at the end certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film but anyway my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film
<START> just in case the title didn't give it away this movie is garbage br br short review yeah br br i decided to spend as much time writing this review as hollywood probably decided to put into the script i doubt it'll be published considering how poorly i worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it stick to cherishing the first movie it completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way the sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic original films of our childhood
<START> in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae br br i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject br br many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck i'm trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually br br this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way like to college br br i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose so of course that would make them look even fatter a ploy use all the time bad bad tyra and crew br br but to be fair americas next top model is not about full figured models it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show the ex model giving others who wouldn't have the chance a chance to enter the doors but after that everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program
<START> it's certainly a direct to video but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think i quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time br br the hero's reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human the hopper character is actually playing god that might be the right thing to do but one may not like that anyway br br in the end the god player is doomed to death and the hero who would have spent his own life can live quite a morale br br the most unrealistic thing i saw is that earth is doing so well with no moon its rotation
<START> strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover fbi agent matthew modine flirting with a mobster's concerned widow michelle to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss dean stockwell br br the movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director jonathan demme the silence of the lambs philadelphia keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained that's good and it avoids being too
<START> if you're a sane person and you have seen films before then you cannot tolerate this piece of for more than 20 minutes and if you do stay there longer then it won't be because you'd expect akshay or paresh not govinda please but because you value your money too much and you want at least a short nap on the plush seating in the multiplex in return of the money they robbed you off its hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like can fall to such levels alright he's repetitive but now he's coming out of all third rate storied and expects us to laugh because he's brought in paresh rawal and akshay kumar no sir this ain't going to work now especially with this stupid script of yours even comedy films can have meaningful scripts lage raho munnabhai anyone br br govinda doesn't have much to do so can't comment akshay kumar was boring paresh rawal cracked some of the worst joke possible lara dutta had real scope for acting in this one but she fails miserably the only high point of the film possibly is tanushree's acting but she's there only for the first 10 minutes br br i don't think this film is worth any more space probably not even this much so final warning don't watch it
<START> the prey has an interesting history unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of 1984 you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer 85 but little else is remembered the plot is your basic killer in the woods again but ironically this was filmed before friday the 13th the prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later but released for about a week at some drive ins yes jim drive in showed this in june of 84 but it has a dated look to it maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984 now on the story it has some kind of back story a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death but one of their children survive our monster so flash forward to present day which would be 1978 we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster the tag line for this picture claims its not human and its got an axe but an axe was only used in these first two killings now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20's camping we all know they are the prey and the monster knocks them of one by one for an 80 minute movie it seems longer we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins overall for being out into an 80 's horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him side note the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the 1990's
<START> where this movies differs from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings in europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other the old enemies always ended living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict in the us the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction the us citizen never had to live with its enemy this explains in my view the often simplistic nature of hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife but in this movie the director and screenplay did not fall into this clichÃ© it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong it's a great story of morality hidden truth and compromise
<START> i didn't think this movie was very good at all basically they took a bunch of one liners from various shirley temple movies threw them together and had orr act like shirley temple acted on screen oh my goodness was said quite a number of times if you are familiar with shirley temple movies you will recognize several lines direct from her movies the trouble is they have orr saying these in shirley's everyday life in the end what we get is a hodgepodge of re created shirley temple movies instead of any sort of real look into shirley temple's life save yourself the trouble and rent shirley temple movies it's a lot better than watching orr try and recreate shirley's acting style
<START> second husband is an amateurish attempt at psychodrama with more to fault than to praise the plot is hacked the story monotonous the acting poor the execution second rate etc not worth the time unless maybe your a relative of one of the actors pu d
<START> this made for tv film is about every clichÃ© you can come up with for a disaster movie the only problem is it isn't very well done br br my brain is still insulted from the scenes in which brian dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala the weather channels commercials why would watching local news footage of a washed out side street give insight to global weather patterns you got me br br also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst cgi effects known to man watch for the semi truck and the airplane that look like they were rendered on a commodore 64 br br all the foreshadowing in this movie is done with the subtlety of a sledgehammer the dialog is forced and i can't think of a likable character that i want to survive the second half br br the character i hate the most is the stupid wife who's husband is cheating maybe if she lifted a finger at anytime during the show instead of being a helpless woman who stands in the the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day her husband wouldn't be sleeping with the pr rep for a rival energy company she is so helpless in fact i want to put her out of her and my misery i hope everyone in this movie dies in the second half
<START> alistair simms is a wonder in this he makes such a good headmistress the role given here for george cole was made for him hence the casting job on this film was perfect i think it was one of those rare occasions where everything clicked the story line was good the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a delight each character you are endeared to even the villains why can't we make films like this any more basically this is a very english comedy with good movement and fluidity
<START> while mind of mencia could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of chappelle's show it is really worse than that first of all carlos mencia is a that is as funny as he is original which isn't saying much the show contains lame spoofs of american television ads and political issues and mencia's comedic insight on politics adds to the low quality of this show on top of it all mencia tosses in more lame ethnic jokes and stolen jeff foxworthy lines than i can count on one hand while every once in a while carlos gets a cheap laugh the rest of the time he spends insulting everyone in sight which does include exploiting his own audience members with the exception of south park drawn together and friday night stand up this show marks the end of the chappelle's show glory days which for those of you who haven't heard was before he went to africa
<START> only three words are really required for this review piece of crap br br if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money the best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor br br yes they do use all of the names and catch phrases the even name the dog in reference to the dog being boy in the cartoon they name the love interest polly but she isn't miss sweet polly br br my wife and son drug me to see this they should have drugged me to see it br br the original underdog was voiced by wally cox the ultimate nerd this one is voiced by someone with a smart teenager that knows more than all the adults attitude br br as a stand alone movie it is awful as an homage to underdog it is even worse it is not an homage it is not a retelling of the story it is not an updating of the story it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising the next time i go to the store i fear that i will see underdog toys pajamas towels sheets clothing etc mcdonalds and burger king probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this br br the worst part of this movie however is the soundtrack they do the underdog theme song to rap read that with a silent c at the beginning great now that we are going to destroy something let's go all the way br br i knew that it would probably be bad before i went my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium and one of only four without stadium seating even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd it will be more entertaining and have better production values
<START> the second live action outing for asterix is far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories that was called the first film instead staying fairly close to the original comic br br in a nutshell queen cleopatra has made a bet with to build a palace in egypt to show that the egyptians are a great people royal architect seeks the help of asterix and druid to complete his task there are several laugh out loud moments some jokes that only the french might get jibes at the 35 hour week while others that are more universal the big budget special effects are spectacular but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic br br depardieu and clavier still work brilliantly as a pair while monica bellucci makes perfect casting as cleopatra also for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film 1
