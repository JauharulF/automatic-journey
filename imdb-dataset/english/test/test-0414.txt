<START> as one other imdb reviewer puts it imagine 2001 a space odyssey in the desert and you wouldn't be far off from a brief of what to expect from this piece of cinema i deeply hesitate to use the word film a lecture on philosophical views on creationism the mythos surrounding humanities existence the before and after that was has been the what is and the what will be this for some maybe a 2001 on sand but they tackle different philosophical viewpoints one about evolution and the future the hope and potential for mankind while fata morgana itself is a somewhat more metaphysical trek i only hope i can convey it effectively enough br br style will not to be everyones liking and those who are not of a perceived hardcore branch of cinematic viewing may and most likely will find this extremely hard going and may not even see it through to its finale after 72 minutes fusing together a montage of footage from the sahara including villages villagers and various other places for a somewhat surrealist ending music of various genres and an almost mythical narration fata morgana is severely slow paced but ultimately hugely rewarding br br opening with a montage of various filmed shots of planes landing for nigh on five minutes you already arrival at the introduction of the film immensely confused and the sense that this will not be like anything you have seen before echoes clear in your mind divided into three sections creation paradise and the golden age fata morgana attempts and succeeds in being able to juxtapose images of the natural beauty of the desert with the man made instruments that taint it its three segments are narrated by different persons each pertaining specifically to the particular section they are voicing and provide extra emphasis on the long and desert montages br br fata morgana is a film dealing with the existence of man on our earth it looks at the natural beauty the earth was designed for and concurrently looking at the potential beauty we have within us more notably shows us our negative contributions to the world in which we live each shot has been purposefully constructed using what can only be described within the context of this film as 'the holy trinity of in pictures words and music each part of these three pieces provides something notably to each shot but when brought together they create something greater than the whole of their parts they create unbridled beauty and deep thought within our minds i will not be able to do this film the justice it deserves with mere words alone perhaps if i had pictures and a score and i do know this will not be appreciated by the masses but this a profound and i will not use the term art film because this is simply just art this is moving art which moves the mind and stirs the soul whether or not creationism is your want is irrelevant because this film is about intelligent design
<START> i caught this movie on local t v at about 4 30 a m i didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something good br br there are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key factor br br the whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character br br your sub conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion br br the technical aspects are very good really good in fact kelly overtone is extremely sexy and she's candy for the eye although she's most of the time in her white clothes br br the fear factor is almost inexistent but there's plenty of mystery and tension to dig from br br i would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers
<START> the other is a supposed horror movie made during the 1970s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidman br br the plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evil br br the idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end br br the execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5 in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a u rated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the other br br you don't need to check out the director's cv to realise horror is not his forte br br mr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the get go i haven't seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expect br br the direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isn't it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in california br br there is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless br br the ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i won't reveal which movie but i'll give 2 clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is well known and i'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie br br the acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are given br br diana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cash in on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewers br br i paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of the region 2 version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongue in cheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s br br the 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salem's lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointment br br if anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie
<START> i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out it didn't bother me that lost world wasn't as intellectual as the original and here i was just hoping for a good monster movie it was all about dinosaurs eat people however it was disappointing even on that level br br for starters there were not enough people to eat and while i'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten it was not enough also while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community there were not nearly enough dinosaurs and many dinosaurs like the spikey back and has a club on its tail just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are br br start spoilers then there were the pterodactyls the figures i've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds while the movie made them look closer to 300 worse they didn't get to eat anybody or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up there was no ending to the movie either it was just all of the sudden credits end spoilers i'm left wondering if the edition i saw was missing 40 minutes of film br br my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long stealthily into your pockets and get your 7 go rent the carnosaur series at least you won't be disappointed
<START> aaron carter plays the pop star j d mcqueen in this movie surprise surprise this is a typical movie where the leading lady jane has a huge crush on j d mcqueen the pop star as well as many other girls but she's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with j d and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy j d has to go to a public school to keep his math grade up in order to do his summer tour problem is j d isn't good at math he finds the smartest person in school jane to tutor him jane tutors and falls in love with j d j d in return falls in love with as well but j d screws up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour the movie is definitely worth watching aaron will be a great actor
<START> a previous imdb reviewer has stated that romance' is a 'rip off' that's the other reviewer's term of a german musical called 'me by day you by night' apparently that reviewer is unaware that both of these films have borrowed their premise from and an english play written by john maddison morton in 1847 this play deals with two who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady each man believing himself the sole tenant because the two men have different work schedules the ruse is not discovered straight away this play was once so popular in britain that 'to box and cox it' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person br br the innovation of romance' and its predecessor is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance as is usual in these cornball movies the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other's arms hoo boy br br the landlord in this film is played by george sidney a character actor who specialised in playing jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic george sidney was never as annoying as the odious harry green the jewish equivalent of stepin fetchit but sidney's depictions of jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch br br the single most notable thing about romance' is that to my knowledge this is the earliest hollywood film to make reference to hitler and the rise of nazism at one point in this movie landlord sidney discovers his teenage son julius engaged in swastikas on the walls and his son are clearly meant to be jewish admittedly nobody in hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what hitler was planning for the jews in europe still it's surprising to see a film depicting a jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke his father is quite properly angered by this display of the nazi symbol br br a very shameful aspect of hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major hollywood studios continued to do business with the third reich as late as 1939 hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as so that their films could be distributed in nazi germany and austria for the same reason hollywood's leading men were documented as and except for darryl zanuck at twentieth century fox all the hollywood studio executives who in this policy were jewish but clearly had no objection to doing business with hitler i'm surprised that romance' contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably as this sequence would have rendered the film verboten in germany and austria maybe the scene was cut out for german release it isn't crucial to the movie's plot apart from this the movie contains nothing notable robert does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation i've never understood the appeal of this man i'll rate romance' 4 out of 10
<START> first of all i personally adore demons and demons 2 i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in russia when i was a kid and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood then i heard nothing about mr bava then i saw his ghost son well it is certainly not a good coming back why was the leading character whom we never really knew to at least like him in accident in the middle of an empty road why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul why is the plot so primitive haven't we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of movie production it is clear that lamberto bava has nothing to show us so far it is a shame
<START> boring horrible piece of italian euro trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time guzzling beer this is what makes him american right our scientists spend most of their academic life soused out of their minds sure that's where all the really great theories come from who's studying something dolphin calls fish migration patterns who knows he hears a weird sound through his headphones proving that his radio is picking up a station in at the same time a jack skellington girl with one of the worst most bleached manes of bad 80's hair that it has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm down the dolphins in the she works at as they're apparently upset about the amount of fish she's been doling out lately the beginning of the film was a really badly colored storyline about two annoying very italian people who's boat is attacked by something unseen under the water the whiny woman is never seen again best part of the story and the guys' corpse is found with no legs the dim alcoholic scientist who has an inexplicable english american italian accent and the stick girl with the hay hair begin to theorize that there's some kind of giant monster lurking under the seas off the coast of italy err florida br br they enlist the help of an electrician to set up an underwater mike so that the monster can sing karaoke this guy has a beautiful girlfriend who's only drawback is that she pronounces peter tah but for some reason he's sexually drawn to the anatomical skeleton with the hair a situation that leaves one blinking br br the dubbing is awful the editor a spaz and the storyline generally a yawn there's a bit about how this weird scientific corporation genetically engineered this monster giant shark squid barracuda thing for some reason that makes no sense and a really unpleasant greasy haired guy goes around killing women again for no apparent reason a stupid sheriff and his bulked up deputy are along for the ride along with a female scientist who we know is smart because she wears huge glasses at one time the woman scientist takes on the huge terrible monster yeah right ed wood's giant octopus was more believable with only a small and she wins the contest hooray for skinny little women who obviously make the best monster hunters br br the solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the everglades leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction to hell with ecology and the environment right we have to kill this giant monster at the end the electrician and his broomstick love ride off into the sunset on her vespa which is o k since she's gotten over her death and he's not very upset that his girlfriend got whacked by the crazy guy with the greasy hair hooray for true love wait a minute isn't there something fishy about all this
<START> i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager i grew up with the sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life jim was a genius and master when i watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when i was younger and things seemed so much simpler for this bit of time travel i rate this movie a 10 br br the plot line explores how kermit goes from the swamp to hollywood the laughs and gags are classic i am glad these films are still around for the next generation i hope i never out grow the magic of the muppets
<START> the title of this documentary is very misleading at no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the nile perch fish into lake victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of the film tries to place the problems of on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force the documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever instead it relies on small of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter there are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the nile perch fish one is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the nile perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species the film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it the second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the nile perch has introduced and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become br br the subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most african countries the film tries to link the introduction of the perch fish with aids poverty and pollution in but never makes a direct connection as any intelligent person well read with problems in africa the problems shown here are not unique to but affect most of africa and have nothing to do with the fish it would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don't the fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many yes things are bad within the town of but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter br br a weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in is quickly discredited by the documentary itself first off is a very large country and lake victoria is only a small portion of the country many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to the fishing town on the lake to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country br br this documentary is very weak has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the nile perch it plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty famine and aids making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the lake victoria region of or directly related to the perch fish the fact is most of the problems have more to do with war globalization and christianity than and environmental effect of the perch fish itself
<START> there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film such a film is i was a communist for the fbi another example would be i married a monster from outer space br br the really interesting thing about this film is how in heaven's name did this get nominated for an oscar in the documentary category it is not a documentary in any sense of the word it's not even in that hybrid category of docudrama it's just a rather exploitive film about the work of an fbi undercover agent named matt who infiltrated the communist party in pittsburgh and got active in trying to take over the union for the communists and reporting on said activities to his handlers in the fbi br br a documentary of that work might have been interesting but what we got was a film to fit those paranoid times i found it fascinating that when finally broke his cover it was to the house un american activities committee rather than the trial in new york of the communist party leaders there was a moment in the film where head communist james millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the house un american activities committee was composed of a bunch of right wing yahoos looking to get their names in front of the camera now what could have given him that idea anyway just connect the dots and no doubt the word their came from j edgar hoover trying to give some credence to huac by having an effective undercover come out there rather than at an actual trial little thing there called cross examination br br warner brothers who produced i was a communist for the fbi later produced big jim which starred john wayne about a huac investigator in hawaii huac did grab on to credit for the work done by the honolulu pd in breaking up a communist spy ring there among the but at least in john wayne's film nobody claimed it was a documentary br br frank lovejoy is in the title role as and his fbi handlers are richard webb and philip carey dorothy hart plays a pittsburgh school teacher who says that there are 30 or so like here in that school system the young among whom is ron hagerthy son she has a change of heart about the communists and lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors ironically hart left the movies and went to work for all places the united nations which as we know has been accused often of being a communist nest in the usa br br over half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print about the communist party of the usa they were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement the real heroes in stopping them were labor organizers like walter in the or david in the but since they were people of the left they just don't have the following on the right to be suitable propaganda material br br anyway i was a communist for the fbi is an exploitive work based on a real life character and a testament to those paranoid times
<START> the second part directed rapidly by joe d'amato specialist in all kinds of of exploitation and interpreted again by miles o'keeffe the budget of the movie to be derisory or minimal in spite of not being a better movie of his not mas entertained ator 2 either it has something something that makes it his introduction you prop it explains origin to us with images of the first part the script is incredible is like any comic book of the brilliant roy thomas has so fantastic elements inside world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men black gentlemen cannibals monkeys the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant the final this struggle very well lacking mas violence and blood but this one well never it becomes boring it has everything what there was lacking ator 1 be charmed with to my me 4 5
<START> even though this film's trailer and poster imply that sally hemmings was an important character i might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor and i do mean minor character if this movie was suppose to being told by sally's very own family i mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character his other lover who happens to be white as the actual love interest i know i wouldn't i am as pale as they come and normally a big fan of ivory flicks but i couldn't stomach this film's treatment of poor sally hemmings
<START> cates is insipid and unconvincing kline over acts as always as does lithgow while butchering an english accent at least i assume that's what he's attempting and the tone staggers uneasily between farcical and maudlin as with most pet projects showcasing a celebrity couple it's a relief when this shoddy piece grinds to it's forced and jarring conclusion
<START> is my favorite comedy movie of all time both aamir and salman khan have acted brilliantly while acting was far better than salman aamir khan is known as 'mr in bollywood and he proves it in every of his film br br the story moves around two young guys amar aamir khan and prem salman khan both are from poor families and are a big dreamer they want to become rich without bearing any pain so when they hear about raveena raveena tandon daughter of mr paresh rawal who comes to india to find his bridegroom they both fool their fathers to marry raveena and the journey begins there is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny paresh rawal is in double role and mr and has acted brilliantly as he always does shakti kapoor crime master gogo also adds a great comedy br br this movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of bollywood
