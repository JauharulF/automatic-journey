<START> extremely good cinematic story of gay embittered former teen star now waiting tables the sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically and with an actual human face this and throw in a serial killer on the loose and you have love and the human remains a well portrayed drama a strange sense of humor and a mystery the screenplay is fluid and believable the performances are well above average and the twists in the story are sharp br br this certainly isn't everyone's ideal notion of a movie but for those who appreciate something different and slickly written it's very much worthy of your time highly recommended
<START> i don't remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of lamps almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures even if outfitted with cheesy '70's style shades to keep with the time setting of the story on one occasion raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mother's house with fixtures in both rooms being taken out yet the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a office and includes but is not limited to the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horse head base which is consequently disintegrated and the severe denting of a shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight later that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot incurring further damage to the plastic coated shade br br while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps one should keep in mind that lamps regardless of their cheap construction or gauche top heavy appearance are still valuable for the illumination that they provide however if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp i would highly recommend this movie
<START> this film is the greatest ninja film ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it then its worth watching i would rate this film a 10 10 if you want to see more then check out http uk geocities com the opening sequence where the evil ninja is killing everyone in his way is excellent his character is the best he then has to possesses woman who finds him dying she then has to take revenge on the cops that killed him which means there's more killing and action but only a ninja can destroy a ninja so she and her boyfriend who is also one of her targets enlist the help of sho kosugi to release the evil ninjas spirit and destroy him
<START> never mind the serious logic gaps never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals never mind the haphazard writing and you might like this movie the main character alyssa was supposed to be endearing the heroine who you root for to be saved or in this case save herself but instead she merely grates and makes one wonder are all pro really that stupid her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor innocent young girl from your grasp with an ever present biting artistic director villain and the cliche's not only does she become anorexic an over the counter junkie and a pathological liar but all in the course of a few months it's like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could cram into two hours with commercials br br believe it or not but i am a dancer this uprising or resurgence of anorexia and that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended in fact the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight i'm not saying eating disorders never occur but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie br br another annoying problem this movie had was the means to an end writing style her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time all in the first half the other supporting characters were merely props decorations to further the story given the right dialogue this would have been a very intricate mind study of a problem as it is it turns into a one woman show and kimberly mccullough doesn't have the chutzpah to pull it off br br to a non dancer this movie would be a supposed insight into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company to a dancer this is a very insulting movie which portrays as stupid and parents as pushy and ill informed those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place 3 10
<START> blind date columbia pictures 1934 was a decent film but i have a few issues with this film first of all i don't fault the actors in this film at all but more or less i have a problem with the script also i understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality but the script made ann character look weak she kept going back and forth between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly's character in the end he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time paul kelly's character although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty ann sothern as opposed to neil hamilton while he did like her a lot i didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character the production values were great but the script could have used a little work
<START> somebody decided to make a black version of airplane br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all of its time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast br br this movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time if nothing else it deserves to be remembered for that accomplishment br br it's not a black thing it's not a white thing it's just a bad thing a really really bad thing picking it apart point by point would be a waste of time the best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it do yourself a favor go buy a picture of a purple airplane and you will have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer br br this one definitely goes under the category of what the were they thinking
<START> at the earth's core was on television yesterday i was at my computer working and happened to glance over and see what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made i was instantly enthralled by the film's shoddy production values appalling acting by all included even peter cushing and horrific unintentionally hilarious action sequences and puppet monsters br br the film is about a victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical buff american hero on a ground boring trip in the welsh countryside little do they know that a great evil lurks at the center of the earth's core br br forget the fact that the title doesn't make sense if they were really at the earth's core they'd be about underground and burning alive in a sea of iron or whatever it is down there forget that the puppets used in the production rival the beast master for being the fakest looking of all time no the real genius of at the earth's core is its naive stupidity a gung ho action spectacle without real action and without real spectacle it is in essence just a gung ho movie and a stupid one at that people who enjoy mst3k style stuff will love this it's appallingly bad and indeed so bad it is almost enjoyable in a strange way
<START> this classic has so many great one liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes that i don't even know where to start if you want advice on dating its here just totally ignore the person you want and then spout out classic lines like chicken's good i like chicken and before you know it you will be having a one nighter in a basement it's a nice basement with a woman who is 35 years younger than you bronson does it all in this film he buys a car for no good reason just so he can murder two gang members paying with cash he buys an ice cream simply because this is america isn't it and ends up wasting someone named the he laughs when he runs just because he stole his camera by the way this is so fast that bronson's regular pistol can't even catch up to him he needs to order a special one just to get this elusive creep he gets cleaned up just so he can eat a really smelly meal stuffed cabbage in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90 degree weather he goes into the dentistry business he always seems to find a crow bar when he needs one and its the same one and last but not least he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow away richie cunningham's older brother chuck who is now strung out and in dire need of a makeover anyway this will all make sense once you have seen this classic all i can say is enjoy i owed you that one dude
<START> i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the only movie that i've wanted to undo watching let me start off by saying that i like b movies i consider ice pirates one of the best comedies ever i'll also note that i'm a writer and that i've met the director writer of this cinematic marvel br br evaluating the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot i'd have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those who don't know dion is a boxer not an actor so we'll forgive him his lame death sequence why doesn't he fire the shotgun he's holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so i'll stick to the egotistical lead which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool has maximum face time in this movie probably because he was a producer his looks are completely fine but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soap operas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the blame is definitely his br br special effects not my specialty but for a low budget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didn't bother me but it also didn't impress br br writing directing oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning not only is the plot rudimentary but the dialog is flat and stilted i understand stylized ness but this was just bad writing the thing that bothered me most was the theft nott stole scenes shots and facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator entire sequences from the good the bad and the ugly that sort of thing just doesn't cut it with me i'll choose not to comment on the shooting because i don't know what it takes to establish a good shot etc br br conclusion don't rent this movie don't even pirate it it's far too bad to waste any time on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself
<START> sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase i don't know what i was thinking but i really couldn't help myself br br i've been meaning to see 'bloody for a long time and i must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price and believe me i live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen it's a real shame that some of these from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten 'bloody is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what it doesn't really have unintentionally funny scenes i know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people but trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part br br in 'blood the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse according to during eclipses the sun and the moon block saturn which controls emotions as a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become uncaring and evil since they don't experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever these 10 year old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings and kill them the body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place in the meantime debbie curtis and steven don't hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces br br like i was saying before 'bloody is surprisingly not funny i know i said that before but i'm truly surprised by this i was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong true it's not exactly what most people would consider a horror movie but if i have to be fair i'd say that the story is decently executed one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations like i did it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable let's face it kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we can't blame them for that but to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny the rest of the actors are also good and if you're a george clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie yeah i know right who cares also julie brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked too bad she didn't have more time on the screen though julie is p br br so basically this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s my only objection regarding 'bloody would be the way to justify the children's motives this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film let's see if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people i'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day and during other days of total eclipse too oh well overall no big deal it's just a simple observation that's all i've seen worse trust me take 'the children' 1980 for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud no believe me 'bloody is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers you're going to enjoy this one very much br br so now you know you're invited to the children's birthday party and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests come on you can't miss it
<START> i love the absurdity and biting humor of surrealist films such as the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie and the exterminating angel to name two other earlier works like the forgotten ones about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in mexico are more serious and provide a strong social message br br however i believe it is which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer while it's true that it's brimming with irony it nevertheless reveals an aspect of buÃ±uel which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest here while the director quite typically throws countless jabs at the catholic church he also appears to show surprisingly a sense of admiration for genuine christian thought and its practice of selfless love br br what luis buÃ±uel unabashedly praising a jesus like figure i always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue that is until i watched my appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following christ's example in a society infested with meanness ignorance and sin but he also presents the hero father as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness without a doubt by the end of the film i was looking up to him and not down on him br br some would argue that father doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values alas if he can't do good in this world who can but i would say that this flaw his frustration precisely makes his character all the more heroic because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be and who says the priest couldn't eventually emerge from that dark night and regain his confidence perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey the elegant open ending in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the story br br i recognize in buÃ±uel the aggressive self professed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social consciousness but after having watched i also sense from him a certain warmth a depth and maturity that's not so evident in his other work br br for the sake of contrast i strongly recommend watching afterward his short film simon of the desert also made in mexico several years later it deals with a similar subject matter the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style
<START> my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger it's about andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her but of course nicole isn't that easy to get along with she just started puberty i'm guessing she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time one day at the beach nicole meets handsome ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie i would give my father the hero 8 10
<START> i am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good let me make it clear that i am a huge hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as i could but this one i felt was so below par not only for hitch's films aw heck i'm being far too nice here this pictured really sucked i don't care that hitch did a favor for the very talented carole lombard but i have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey chemistry between lombard and robert montgomery i like mashed potatoes and ice cream but i wouldn't want to taste them together i have seen better chemistry in chemical spills on th highway than here br br if you really love hitchcock avoid this film and see any one of his better ones for crying out loud the bits hitch did on the old tv show were funnier than anything this film fails miserably to deliver
<START> bedrooms and hallways gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy if you think that all gay comedies are the same check this one out although the movie ends without much resolution the hilarious one liners peculiar situations and quirky characters are sure to satisfy
<START> i wandered into blockbuster with a friend the other night having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to do active she decided she wanted to watch closer which seemed like such a repellant idea that i had to rent another film for once she'd gone to bed looking around i didn't see much that interested me but saw the doll master in the new releases section just based on the cover sleeve a woman with a doll like face crying tears of blood i thought this would be interesting enough to rent br br as for the film itself watching it in an almost empty house with all the lights turned off it was pretty scary i must admit i've always had a bit of a phobia of dolls since i was a kid and watched an awful film called asylum one of the stories in it involved a mental patient creating a doll which killed people lame but scary at the time and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me the first half hour in particular was awesome the creepy foreboding atmosphere really set the scene well and without moving the dolls seemed genuinely threatening but unfortunately as soon as they did start to move it all got a bit cheesy i was a bit disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely frightening made me laugh because of the way they were filmed br br as for the characters it's a horror film you're not really expecting anything memorable i found i remembered names and faces better than most asian horror films i've seen which suggests there must have been some hidden character development that i didn't consciously notice the typical stereotypes are out in force in this movie each one having some kind of character quirk that sets them apart from the others from shy and quiet ha and her doll damien to the outgoing bimbo seon br br the plot itself was fairly cool even though the ending which bought together many of the loose strands of plot seemed a bit confused and didn't really do anything for me although it did have a couple of really cool plot twists that i won't ruin here the basic plot is a bunch of kids are invited to be modelled as dolls by a famous reclusive old doll maker they have to stay in the creepy house adorned with scary dolls some big some small and things start to happen as our heroine hae mi starts to explore areas of the house and things start happening to the other inhabitants br br overall i would definitely recommend the film not to watch with too many people as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends but as something too watch on your own in the dark with the windows and doors open just a bit just in case any dolls feel like watching with you it really does leave you guessing for most of the film allowing you to go off on wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later on if you really get into it and ignore it's cheesiness in places i can guarantee you'll check under your bed before you go to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on br br or maybe that's just me p as for closer it was ok but i preferred this
