<START> while driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved betty ann adam eric is surprised by his former schoolmate harley justin urich on the backseat of his car adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron harley because of betty ann along their road trip harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road after some incidents they give a lift to the hitchhiker sarah aimee brooks and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck br br in spite of having one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a horror movie the irritating harley monster man is a surprisingly good trash horror comedy the story is a collection of clichÃ©s beginning like joy ride or duel then it turns to one of the countless rip offs of the texas chainsaw massacre there is a surprising twist ending with a hook for a sequel there are hilarious scenes aimee brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains my vote is seven br br title brazil monster man
<START> i'm sure i saw future kill for the same reason as most people the awesome poster by hr giger and like everyone else i was disappointed to find that the movie could not live up to the poster giger said that director moore actually begged him to do it when i first saw this at the age of 14 i thought it was the worst movie ever made i'd still think that if i hadn't seen certain movies on mst3k since then br br the plot has a bunch of annoying college boys driving into the mutant city to kidnap a gang leader for their fraternity that's when they meet splatter ed neal a mutant cyborg psycho who kills the gang leader and blames it on the frats as an excuse to hunt them down and seize power the rest of the movie consists mostly of chases a hand full of frats try to battle their way out of mutant city which i think is supposed to be la even though it was made in texas there's some pseudo political stuff about the frat boys' society being pro nuclear weapons and the mutant society being anti nuke there's talk of how splatter became a freak due to radiation most people develop cancer from radiation but splatter just shoots spikes and slaughters girls yeah that makes tons of sense at one point our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two pro nuke police and she shows them how the other half lives the other half it turns out are all punk kids who dance around to a bad 80s pop band so our little epic is both dumb and dated that's really all there is to it frat boys running around in messed up buildings while guys who look like bikers try to kill them oh and it's the future br br i don't think you'll have any doubt about why ron w moore never made another movie this thing is a real stinker if you like giger buy his books they have the poster without the horrors of the movie or just watch alien again future kill is a waste of time that nobody needs br br if this description makes the picture sound good there's another crappy movie that does the same thing only bigger and better after the fall of new york it's crap but it blows future kill off the screen
<START> i read the book written by bill carter on which this movie is based many years ago the book is certainly stronger than the movie it provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that i thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items all things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between jay leno and david letterman in the early 90's to host the tonight show after the retirement of johnny carson br br the highlight is clearly the performances i can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well known and on tv on a regular basis john michael higgins nailed the part of letterman perfectly watching him really was like watching letterman daniel roebuck tried valiantly to be jay leno but somehow didn't pull it off as effectively his whole look seemed fake and he just didn't seem natural in the role in a less central role rich little not surprisingly nailed the voice of carson although the look was a bit off in the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably leno's agent helen in the movie kathy bates was perfect in the role although not quite as out of control as carter's portrayal of the woman in writing br br in the end this is light and entertaining viewing the subject matter isn't especially important in the overall scheme of things but it's a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry 7 10
<START> this short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious br br after a session at a recording studio frank sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was jewish he lectured them as only an american icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the nazis the meaning could not be clearer br br both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for columbia records if you are but a dream and the song written for the film the house i live in the latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of america we'd all like to strive for br br sinatra in fact recorded the house i live in again during the sixties for a joint album he did for his reprise record label the album is now a rarity and it shouldn't be his collaborators were bing crosby and fred waring and his with the orchestra conducted by nelson riddle br br axel was sinatra's primary music conductor and arranger during the forties when he died that position eventually fell to nelson riddle does the orchestration for the short and the columbia record riddle for the reprise record br br sinatra aficionados and others should listen to both back to back and compare and catch this worthwhile film whenever it is shown
<START> this is the first feature film from australian comedian mick mick wrote the film with his brother richard with help from john clarke another comedian and actor mick john also have starring roles along with several other iconic australian actors bill hunter frank wilson et al the basic premise of the movie is that slimy jack simpson mick has become a member of a lawn bowls club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work the club is in dire financial straits and calls on jack to help john clarke plays the clubs arch nemesis he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a poker machine slum jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and jacks eventual redemption this is quite a clever little movie it is well above mick usual gutter humor it is pretty well written and well acted the older aussie actors are brilliant bill hunter frank wilson monica maughan and the film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace but that adds to the charm of the movie there is low level coarse language
<START> what a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast the director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances on not messing with them and using music and what wonderful music it is to great effect s in the lead role is great i had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although i have enjoyed her on law and order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role macy gray is terrific mos def as usual wonderful lou gossett great jimmy terrific and doesn't try to pull focus because he's a star a true piece of ensemble acting br br rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it something special
<START> you could tell from the opening shot of the conveyor belt in the bank that this was going to be a great film br br a touch minimalist in feel with a twist of retro this film oozes style the brilliant camera work acting script and the manner that the secret life of the protagonist unfolds all complement each other in possibly making the best italian film i've ever seen up there with la stanza del albeit different br br shame on the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they couldn't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously crafted by the camera don't miss
<START> one of fuller's a combat veteran himself early works of average quality but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar germany the main character starts the movie in as a sgt with c co which really did end the war in munich as in the movie same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in and then liberated part of the dachau facility to the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good bad of the german people but anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45 47 germany the only inaccuracy i noticed was minor while on a boat cruise of the rhine passing the remains of the bridge he comments he crossed there but his unit really crossed well south of there north of worms germany
<START> i never heard of this film when it first came out it must have sunk immediately o i saw it on cable while sick in hospital so i hardly had enough energy to watch it let alone turn the channel better choice than the style channel 0 filmed on location this travelogue should have been on the travel channel the plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties the cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties donald o'connor star of musicals and edward as a card shark as to the main cast walter matthau is still playing the same part as he did in guys and dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl irresponsible gambler and rounder but it just doesn't take with a man of his age as to jack lemmon he plays his part so straight he can hardly dip and glide when dancing and as mentioned dyan cannon is outstandingly attractive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks walter is rich while he thinks she is rich elaine plays mother another retread from the fifties the most fun is the running feud between brent spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots walter as a poor dancer and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage in the end though he receives his meanwhile jack mopes about meets an attractive woman with mutual attraction but their affair is broken up by walter's lies that jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired department store buyer but finally the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her and all is well there does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty
<START> i saw this movie in september with my mother i was expecting a good movie and i saw an excellent one this is now my most treasured movie it did not leave me after i left the theater the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother meryl streep and renee zellweger were equally incredible this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are rent it i can't recommend it enough
<START> i was like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television i have to say that the idea of sitting down to view 90 minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a sunday was not a welcome one the thought of yet another over worthy bafta winning possibility did not me however the end result knocked me for 6 this is some of the best television i have seen in ages for years i was under the impression that all originality had left the bbc's drama department our friends in the north was the last production that truly blew me away and that was 10 years ago however faith is restored and honour is satisfied david tenant was incredible so many actors i can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this but never once did i see mr tenant as an actor or as the doctor all i saw was alan hamilton i haven't had my heart wrenched this much since daniel craigs performance as geordie peacock all those years ago sarah parish was also incredible and i really hope this role brings her better roles in the future all of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside head the toaster scene in particular made me feel quite queasy
<START> fred was such a great show it was simple but somehow very addicting i can still remember the days when i'd watch this on kids wb saturdays but then kids wb did the unforgivable kids wb became like that older relative that tries to act hip and funky fresh shudder they became like that relative who tries to act all cool but the attempt is a cheesy disaster they pulled coconut fred's fruit salad inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows i've ever seen in my life johnny test the only thing that keeps me watching anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids it was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule this brings me back to my first point bring it back
<START> i started watching this expecting the worst i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable slightly confusing in parts like when they all started singing it gave me a chance to see daniel wu in action for the first time he is a better actor than i thought at times he seemed a bit out of place i thought purple storm deserves its hong kong legends release as it is different to most other hk films it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film wil make sense for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it so i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me that i enjoyed it
<START> the growth of tax funds and sale and schemes has led to a raft of films that are gathering dust in laboratories and vaults all over the british isles because they seem to be made purely because they fit the financial criteria rather than had any potential audience a lucky few get a week at a small screen in london before going to budget dvd but the riddle distinguished itself by completely bypassing cinema tv or even the rental market to premiere as a free gift dvd in the mail on sunday br br it's all too easy to see why this ended up being literally given away aside from a couple of glitches a boom mike is clearly visible in one shot it's not particularly badly made and while vinnie jones comes over like modern british cinema's version of freddie mills mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to move up to the crime desk and the supporting cast veer from ham to vaguely passable nobody's distinguishing themselves here by being either outstandingly good or outstandingly bad mediocrity is more the norm here the real problem is that like so many sale and tax fund films it's a 'soft' film there's no reason to watch it it exists because the circumstances existed for it to be made but it lacks pace or forward momentum it seems to be aiming for the sunday teatime telly audience despite being shot in scope but doesn't cut it there are a couple of ideas in this determinedly inoffensive tale of a unpublished charles dickens manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in modern day but the mystery element is so painfully obvious as is the last minute supernatural twist you'll never guess who jacobi's literate tramp really is what you guessed that you're almost expecting the scooby gang or the double to turn up to solve it br br it's a very misconceived film for all kinds of reasons a few cast members are playing double roles when they shouldn't even be playing one and the whole shock reveal of the truth of the dickens manuscript is completely bungled because it's all narrated in the first person by dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel the main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot with characters suddenly reminding vinnie that he's forgotten about that one already heralding an increasingly desperate final half hour that sees wicked developer jason secretary puts some in drink so she can have her wicked way with him and leave incriminating photos behind to make you look a git with your girlfriend leading to him having a dream where he talks to charles dickens you're charles what's in a name who offers the somewhat less than likely suggestion that you read too many books but all that's as nothing compared to the finale which falls into utter absurdity with logic and common sense going completely out the window as it plays like some bizarre revenge tragedy with handguns on the banks of the thames with two day guest stars flemyng and vanessa redgrave looking like they'd much rather be somewhere else mel smith turns up in a one day cameo so it's clear that the film's 'names' are mainly there for an easy or to meet their alimony payments the film's final image is so utterly absurd and pointless as to almost make it worth watching though br br one curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third for vera day a sort of prototype liz fraser and one time mainstay of 50s british films the barmaid in hell drivers the barmaid in quatermass ii here promoted to pub owner while standup comedian kenny lynch turns up briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster oh and the late gareth hunt makes his last bow as oh the irony a coroner br br just to round out the package the freebie dvd also included a trailer for the director's other film with vinnie jones bog bodies a naff looking british horror with transatlantic scientists and vinnie in elmer fudd duck hunter outfit terrorized by a reanimated 2000 year old sacrificial victim from the nearest peat bog be i'm hunting i can hardly wait br br the one thing i can guarantee however is that every indie producer in the uk is going to spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much the mail paid for the license to press the dvd they paid prince 000 for his new cd with so many british tax shelter indies on the shelf and with money so hard to find at the moment this could become an interesting fallback market for british flicks
<START> from the acting direction scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention br br dr suess is rolling in his grave right now what with the dirty ho s h i t and fake erection scenes etc etc etc its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t a greed greed and more greed br br compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into these guys should stick to making mtv videos how on earth this movie got 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me unless its the directors family
