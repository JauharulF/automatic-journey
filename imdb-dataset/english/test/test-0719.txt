<START> as a serious i was seriously disappointed in this film its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or novice following the stories of 2 first time one senior one injured runner and two elites as they prepare for the chicago marathon the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is for lack of a better word boring while i did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of the brief history of the boston marathon and in general let me emphasize these were brief watching some joe runners prepare for a saturday run with their water bottles and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring and the nonstop clichÃ©s about achievement and feel good grinning runners will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter if you are a first time this film may give you a feeling of i can do it for anyone else run away
<START> the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu 1976 is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo the film stars dorian tan tan tao liang and features jackie chan sammo hung and james in significant supporting roles many people believe or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising that this is a jackie chan film this is not a jackie chan film dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best most serious early performances br br the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named tan who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi woo along his journey meets up with a young named tan chan and a disgraced sword fighter chang chung known as the wanderer both men have suffered at the hands of and want to take revenge the three team up to defeat and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety br br the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the northern eighteen styles kicks along with some southern five styles boxing sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well james is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan tan and hung are very good br br director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film which is refreshing the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era joseph music a combination of soft flutes and 70's shaft style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best hand of death is not jackie and sammo's usual kung fu comedy hand of death is a serious straightforward revenge driven story br br hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen br br hand of death is a solid stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo br br kung fu genre rating 7 5 10 br br wanderer to tan referring to his new weapon the little eagle wing god lance br br tan just a
<START> ok i read the director's comment about this movie featured as the and i have to admit that i can identify with his position br br micheal i hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other better things i've seen this movie in the mst3k form even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it and this is one of those films mitchell is another where the mst3k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better you know they had some unfair fun at the actress' expense because it made for a livelier episode br br imo the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something and had a few decent effective moments here and there should keep it out of the tangents time chasers is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either br br but it is still not a very good movie i don't blame the writer lead actress for being who she is it's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film the writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash and the dialog is often barely up to abc afterschool special standards the cast sincerely gives it their best effort and the acting in general is definitely head and shoulders above abortions like future war or space mutiny but there aren't any really professional level performances here with the exception of 'big estevez who is hammy but suitably intense i never saw the full original cut but mst's sampling of was representative enough to make these facts plain br br oh and the film has robert z'dar in it that is imo a real of death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously yes he's big and scary looking in his role but i just hate the guy as an actor in real life i wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable br br there were little things i liked about the film for instance the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable it didn't really work but it might have with just a little more tweaking br br so anyway mr better luck with your other projects your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if the 'buzz' was good and ms miller has nothing to be ashamed of she was young and ambitious and the movie wasn't that bad
<START> a reputed critic praised such a movie br br the film has a weird story wherein a lover sells his love to a brothel cos he wants money to save his mother and then also gets for it lol br br the movie is crap br br the entire first half has it's focus on romance comedy which fails to work the twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clichÃ©d br br direction by aditya is bad music is typical himesh br br emraan does his serious role well but his wardrobe his way of walking through songs etc is similar to his previous films annoys ashmith patel fails to convince this actor was good in murder only so far and then a downhill mithun some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced ranjeet is okay
<START> title opera 1987 director dario argento cast cristina ian charleson daria review the only other argento movie i had seen was suspiria and that one blew me away with its style colors and spooky story line i next decided to go with opera as i had been told it was one of his best man i think i'm discovering what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors br br opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the main star of a creepy modern opera take on mc beth gets hit by a car betty is the so she gets to do the part herself too bad for her there's a psycho after her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co workers br br wow id heard good things about this here flick but i wasn't prepared for the level of greatness to which this film would take me yeah the movie has its shortcomings to which ill get to later but for the most part the movie blew me away br br first off this movie is not as filled with lots of colors as suspiria i was expecting it to be a bit like suspiria in that department but no to my surprise it had its own look and feel the film is somehow devoid of color it does have lots in colors in certain scenes like the masterful kitchen living room sequence where argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues but for the most part the film has a grayish black tone to it all through out and i liked that it had its own distinctive look br br the real stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death sequences wow every death scene was like a work of art beauty in destruction these are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of its situations loved every second of them there's plenty of blood and mayhem here but with style not gonna spoil em though br br then there's the direction man there's some really original and beautiful shots on this one i loved the inventive use of the camera on this one you thought that shot in kill bill vol 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber of the gun was original well this is the movie he lifted it from i honestly believe that tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in kill bill vol 1 heck in the making of feature he mentions that the whole scene with beatrix in the hospital and elle driver coming to kill her was influenced by italian giallos and here my friends is the proof of that anyhows tarantino references aside this movie has some amazing camera shots like those scenes of the crows flying through the crowd in the opera house great stuff and a main reason why becoming one of my favorites br br the acting from most of the cast was alright but the best by far was cristina as the tortured young opera singer betty the looks in her eyes as the murders were being committed were great the rest of the cast was a little wooden and stiff but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the film br br there were very few things i didn't like about this movie first off logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes specially those involving reactions after shes seen the murders it seem to me that for the longest time she just went on about her business not telling anyone about the whole thing not even the police i mean if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes you don't just walk away from the murder scene and continue with your life someone would have connected her to the murders she might have even become a suspect herself but no also the ending is a bit anti climactic you'll have to see this to understand but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the film ended it felt like it could have ended earlier it would not have felt so redundant but thats about it not real big problems for me really since i was enjoying the rest of this beautiful film br br i've still got a lot of argento territory to cover but i'm devouring every step of the way like if i was eating a plate of the most expensive caviar this guys really good i think of his films as works of art and i've only seen two of em cant wait to discover the rest of his films argento you the man br br rating 41 2 out of 5
<START> man i loved ocean's 11 br br smart movie all eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale br br what on earth was oceans 12 what was the purpose of the twelfth person i assume it's supposed to be zeta jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film it was more like the story of brad and zeta jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie br br with o 11 the gang were always a step ahead of benedict garcia they were always able to outsmart him what happened here he catches up with them after a tip off and suddenly they're all wusses the whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier so next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist puh lease br br this movie could have been achieved with just brad pitt zeta jones and 5 mins of matt damon for the switcheroo scene br br slow moving movie not the energy of the first one i tried hard to like it and i'm usually very easy to please but i'm really disappointed br br spoiler the twist the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours br br end spoiler br br wait until it comes on tv or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this
<START> i originally saw this movie in a movie theater on times square in the late eighties who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following night of the demons was like most other films that came out at the time a group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by saw ii that i recently saw br br i saw mimi kinkade at a fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted i guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks anyway i just this film again on vhs cassette and this movie still holds up a little slow at the beginning as i remembered when i first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace one of the eighties horror classics and worth a look
<START> cooley high is considered one of my best all time movies it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early mid and late 1960's what ever happened to brenda and some one to track those two down brenda for her beauty and for his innocent wit they both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame all of the cast of this movie was great my opinion is of cooley high is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years
<START> this is the worst waste of time i've ever experienced not even close to the first one the story line difficult to follow plot was weak at best the whole thing looked like three stories trying some way to tie them together and make a movie it had a few good lines here and there and the attempt at the message was admirable but they went from houston through new york to get to dallas it was really hard to tell over what period of time the present time took up the movie was just over an hour and it felt like we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon points for being honest but a son should not have to do all that felt he had to do do your self a favor watch again
<START> i hated the book a guy meets a smart dog gets a virgin girlfriend and all the while they're being chased by a hit man and a ape beast thing both of whom want the dog dean koontz really can't write i read the book at my sister's recommendation i should have known better when i saw this mostly out of a morbid curiosity i actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of i figured at least if they're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book i've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate they turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother for some reason that bothered me most of all even though i seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn't have made it any better quite simply bad book bad movie don't see it
<START> a hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in small town american jill johnson belle settles in for a night of babysitting with the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in she locks the door and sets the alarm but when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she check the children jill panics fear to terror when she has the calls traced and what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a 16 year old's worst nightmare there aren't any other lead actors in this movie camilla belle is the main star with a cute face the day she arrives to babysit she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her br br if i were in a house like the one jill was in i would explore everything that is around the fridge would be the first person i would looks at but i'm a male and i don't babysit but what i found funny was the size of the house i was thinking would the movie be the same if the house weren't so big anyone could get lost in that huge house but this movie needed a house with a massive size br br camilla belle has a cute face a perfect smile but it's like for a movie like this the lead actress needs someone with experience i found camilla not that good i don't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role i do like her she is a cute girl but someone to have a role in this movie has to be someone how is different to take it br br this movie wasn't scary i also found this movie more like a chick flick i think the only reason this was released during the superbowl weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to go see this it also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys but i did like this movie but for how it is girls just like et scared or scream this was just a pretty decent movie br br maybe anyone could like this movie there are many pg 13 horror films that never succeed this was on its own level so i kinda liked this movie i give it a 7 10
<START> most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head viewers under a certain age and with iq's of three digits should avoid chance of a lifetime like a george w bush facing a congressional grilling br br the cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well written script is the premise wildly original no but the movie stands out like a lighthouse at midnight in the current and non ending glut of movies tv geared to the most desirable audience demographic of teenagers and young adults br br in addition to betty white and leslie neilsen in the leads the cast also has ever reliable veterans like elaine and william windom the sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros br br chance of a lifetime is definitely not a movie for the will ferrell adam sandler saw slasher gore fests american eye dull and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge ground out by hollywood and tv
<START> some people may call cooley high the same sort of thing as american graffiti but i wouldn't for starters in ag everyone was white whereas in ch they're all black moreover this one has a motown soundtrack specifically the movie focuses on several working class african american students in 1964 chicago and their antics the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships in their apartments we see that there's never any dad around but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest br br one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie but overall the main star is the soundtrack it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history we even have it on vinyl here at home a classic in the real sense of the word
<START> starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles starving children and mutilated palestinians i quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the and then oh my god actually have pay for what they have done i kept watching and many questions are raised were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did lots of questions asked and then dropped no interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial nothing br br in short nothing new from what every swede has seen on tv a hundred times just poor propaganda
<START> imagine the most cliche ridden b movie horror plot you can add more plot holes than plot have it scripted by a 10 year old have the acting done by a level drama students faking really bad us accents in the isle of man add monster special effects that the lovers of b w dr who shows will appreciate result duff film throw in samantha janus taking her clothes off make a point of this on the cover and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway
