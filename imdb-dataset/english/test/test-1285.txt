<START> if you liked lock stock and two smoking barrels the chances are you'll like this too although i guess a few of the british in jokes like calling two london characters dixon and after arsenal soccer players may be lost on some this is still cracking entertainment which pumps with vitality br br carlyle miller and tyler are all excellent bringing depth to their characters and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well judged in fact scott's direction is very assured considering that this is his first feature film and proves that he has his father's talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings br br hell i've convinced myself i'm gonna see it again
<START> terrible terrible movie for television once again lifetime brings us the predictable triangle scheming bitchy woman out to get stupid unknowing wife of yet another stupid husband who doesn't have a clue br br i get antsy when i see these films you may ask why do i watch them then i haven't a clue usually by mistake and the movie is so bad i can't get away from it i wait for the bitch to get her come up pence and usually i'm not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts br br now if you can believe our vixen she steals embryos from the clinic and how does one do that without blood tests dna inquiries and recommendations she proceeds to kill the realtor gabrielle rose who is on to her in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her she kills the mother susan hogan and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book guess what i won't continue on this br br finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch well good triumphs evil but much too slowly victoria pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role looking a bit too disheveled and obvious tori spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time she's got those big big bette davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head i liked her better in trick and plays the husband going around assuring his wife there's nothing too he and his ex girlfriend even though he's spotted all over town being very chummy with her standing half naked with her in his house when he sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight yet he continues to deny the romance br br lifetime never disappoints the viewers with their inane plots and stories about women and their stupid husbands wish i could give this chestnut a 0 rating
<START> where do i begin the story was so bad it must have been written in a high school film club the acting was so wooden i felt sorry for the actors one actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights another actor has this constant look of being constipated but it was the dialog that takes the cake br br our hero says to his captors all holding submachine guns if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead moments later the strongest guard built like a truck and the only women prisoner go at it when our fearless leader who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression he calmly walks up to the guard while machine guns are trained on him and in a split second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick he then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing but essentially yell at him br br i could go on and on this movie is camp gem and if you have any sense of humor it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear
<START> i decided to hire out this movie along with a few other old horror movies this was the worst some of the killings were good and theres a bit of humour but i couldnt stand this everytime a killing happened they would show scenes of all these old movies that the killer used to be in i give this 2 10
<START> upon completing this infernal piece of trash a friend and i swore a solemn vow never to again speak of how we had just trashed away the last 90 minutes of our lives this film is completely pointless a two dimensional hero and heroin who we can't give a hoot whether or not they survive and some of the lamest villains to ever darken the screen of horror or any other genre to further prove just how absolutely pointless this film was i would have liked to add a plot synopsis but i can't write fiction all and all the only reason i can think of that anyone would ever want to view this film is if they had just murdered their entire community and is looking for some self afflicted punishment that will haunt you for all following years to come
<START> construction workers disrupt the native american burial ground of a large hulking skeletal monster which disintegrates it's victims with it's touch breath or bone sword the head honcho over the resort project krantz jim storm orders his construction crew to keep their skeletal findings secret for much would halt the continuing development if the nearby katona tribe caught wind that remains were being dug up and disturbed an aging bruce likable as always stars as half breed sheriff evans trying to keep peace between the and crew the peace was strained at best but with that skeletal monster running rampant making it's victims vanish without a trace soon krantz wants answers to why members of his crew are missing evans begins losing citizens as well evans is warned by katona chief storm cloud michael horse that an ancient demon the bone eater has been loosened and can only be stopped with a sacred war axe the axe was removed by a worker who found it's remains with the weapon inside now in the back seat of his daughter kelly's clara bryant who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how daddy's girl has grown into quite a striking lady boyfriend's truck evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing will stop and this must occur before the eclipse or it's power will become too strong for anyone to vanquish br br a solid cast floundering in an embarrassing horror outing the cgi isn't very good although the monster could've been quite threatening if done with a better budget it rides a horse made from dust chasing after it's prey for some cameo appearances include buck rogers gil gerard as evan's deputy big jim star trek's walter koenig as a coroner house's william katt as a country doctor attending to the wounds of evan's deputy none of these cameos last longer than one minute or so sad really impresses in an underwritten role as a brooding katona johnny black hawk who wishes to use the bone eater to drive the white man off his tribe's land jennifer lee wiggins portrays a tasty dish of a katona female whose against black hawk's hatred for the white man and wishes for evans to follow his indian blood regarding putting an end to the bone eating monster this might be worth sitting through if just to see dressed in war paint and indian garb i felt for the actor to be honest as bruce tries to keep a straight face in such a terrible movie in yet another over worked and tiresome clichÃ© bruce's sheriff has an estranged relationship with his daughter whose 17 hot and wanting to date the bad boy although this winds up being an underwritten sub plot as is most of the plot concerning the killing skeleton and many of the poorly developed characters
<START> this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named from age 8 through to 36 told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life so for example when he's eight it's the eight year old's voice that is doing the narration when he's in junior high it's that one doing the narration etc that's about the only interesting thing about this movie it looks like each actor playing is a separate character not only do they not look alike their life experiences don't seem to match up br br avoid this movie like a bad cold
<START> it's easy to see why many people consider in the mood for love to be wong kar wai's best film the toned down appeal of the film centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer is a retread into happy together territory but without the hyper kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper saturated sequences that have become a trademark of kar wai's films since chungking express like soderbergh's the limey this is a different kind of curio for kar wai where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis br br it's a testament to the genius of kar wai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating chow mo wan tony leung and su li zhen maggie cheung move in next door to each other within the same apartment building he's a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that kar wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand br br the key to the success of the film is kar wai's use of the interior space playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of polanski during the sensuous first half of the film kar wai isolates leung and cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible kar wai is concerned with environment and space here creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters it's also telling that kar wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of mo wan and li spouses their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other br br this is not to suggest that in the mood for love is a confining experience because kar wai manages to his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound there is one shot where cheung's slow sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into leung's descent down the very same stairwell their movements perfectly compliment each other bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite the erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating as two star crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity br br other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slow motion shots of cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings set to mike hauntingly beautiful score cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between li and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub conscious br br if i make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing on each other it probably isn't that far fetched of a statement the tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors the film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals kar wai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet mother nature even seems to respond to their love lust often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have near each other br br kar wai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed leung's lai yu fai to experience a cathartic release in happy together even if leslie cheung's ho po wing was not there to enjoy it with him by that film's end love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled yu realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace even if it would not bring him back his lover mo wan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple his own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country and the absence of li is only made tolerable by the fact that kar wai allows mo wan to experience a release of sorts mo wan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose
<START> this one is a real stinker br br the story just isn't up to par with most other tz episodes it's pretty boring though seeing peter falk made up as a fidel castro lookalike is kind of amusing br br whenever twilight zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown i'd grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment 9 times out of 10 it wound up being this episode strange thing this often happened to my mom another tz fan like me as well there were so many times that one of us would say to the other i was all set to watch the twilight zone and guess which episode was on the cuban dictator episode obviously some people like this episode as it gets a 6 7 rating how that happened i have no idea but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot
<START> so me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind so why not pick up the third installment in the scarecrow series keep in mind that this is not just scarecrow three this is scarecrow gone wild now both of us had seen to the first two scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job let's start with the cover of the dvd first first we notice a picture of ken shamrock the world's most dangerous man on the cover apparently he was used to market the movie as the lead actor by the way he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class next we notice a picture of a very attractive and very scantily clad woman in the middle ground of the cover i can assure you that she is not in the movie at all at the time of rental we assumed that this was to reiterate the fact that the scarecrow was going wild in the background we noticed a large carnival on an island out in the ocean i can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the movie at all looking back me and my friend should have known something was up i mean really who the heck puts a carnival on an island now on to the actual movie we start when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field don't ask me how they were fused but think of when brandon lee waking up from the dead in the crow it's just that stupid but in the scarecrow's defense he has gone wild anyhoo the scarecrow who now lives vicariously through the young man takes a trip to his local beach to those who had done him wrong because yes in the world of the scarecrow beaches are conveniently located in the same general vicinity as cornfields to make a long story short the scarecrow kills all who stand in his path without any warning except for the scarecrow's trademark whistle that signals a slashing this is however rather impossible to believe because the scarecrow's mouth is clearly sewn shut several tracking shots that would make kubrick roll over in his grave later and we have one of the worst third installments in a series ever well except for maybe the third matrix as joel siegel would say this scarecrow is wildly bad
<START> usually i'm the one criticizing the twenty something neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t ts gunfights and car chases however in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions at least i wouldn't have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels br br i don't mind surreal and i certainly don't mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning but there should be some point to the whole thing i didn't get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were instead just so self absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered or perhaps they just got confused themselves either way i don't care it bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace br br although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography i must respectfully disagree perhaps i didn't mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals br br or perhaps this movie was just crap br br i give it a 1 and file it next to ishtar
<START> big spoiler this is a terrible movie with no likable characters so many clichÃ©s and senseless scenes it needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left please save your two hours the only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself the description read moments of dark comedy perhaps i missed those when i blinked the horrible characters start right with the funeral the funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide then the father makes digs at the only son left right at the funeral how is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with sigourney weaver's character is the bad guy for telling the husband the father doesn't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist the movie tries to shove every dramatic clichÃ© possible into one movie father over driving athletic son to succeed dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide the son left feeling lost and alone drugs marital affairs child conceived via affair but raised as husband's son incest homosexual tendencies bullies possible terminal illness etc etc etc do not waste your 2 hours
<START> this film screened at the american cinematheque's egyptian theatre in hollywood on april 7 1999 it was described in the american cinematheque schedule as follows br br tomorrow is another day 1951 warners 90 min steve an ex con who's never been with a woman ruth roman is a dime a dance dame with no use for sappy men a hotel room a dirty cop a gunshot the perfect jump off for a fugitives on the run love story this virtually unknown noir is felix feist's masterwork packed with revelatory set pieces cochran was never more vulnerable roman never sexier imagine gun crazy scripted by it's that good br br i just saw this film and i agree with every word of the above description
<START> terror in the aisles might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has in fact very few to offer granted it presents a decent and versatile too versatile selection of horror thriller fragments that are considered classic but what's the point this documentary primarily aims for the horror loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already haven't we the only thing really praiseworthy about this project is the editing if you're into scream queens chases by vile murderers and that sort of things terror in the aisles has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences all these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring donald pleasance and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater in between two sequences the address the viewer and explain why we love horror so much those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious it's in our nature to be afraid bla bla bla and i fail to understand why many people love the concept this is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing on the contrary in case you still have to see a classic genre title beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing the main reason why i overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known but fundamental foreign titles endlessly focusing on halloween this does result in a cool inside joke however when donald pleasance screams to the screen at his own character
<START> with the exception of the main character the acting didn't convince me but the story was quite good it's about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary as you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my all time favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it it's entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated films that i liked less with 9 this is clearly a 10 for me some people may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
