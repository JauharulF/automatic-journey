<START> i just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago br br it's not a big movie and doesn't try to make a big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom are nothing less than amazing in this movie br br the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman sort of a valet putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway br br this is a character driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows and is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple br br yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been br br although it doesn't get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay br br i had remembered this as being a good movie but i wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser
<START> well sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea and despite the mostly negative responses i've heard to it and the suspiciously dvd release i couldn't help but pick it up any wu xia film is better than most non wu xia films in my eyes d perhaps low expectations were an advantage because i was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable br br an assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit this doesn't take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolution br br the film is typically melodramatic for a korean film and resolutely serious in tone no hk style comedy moments to be found here the story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually the film goes a bit wobbly at the end but no worse than a chang cheh film might do and for the most part i found it enjoyable the production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it the fight scenes aren't up to the calibre of the better hk wu xia films but perhaps they're not meant to be the fights are more realistic in that they're less like choreographed dance routines but there's some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in wu xia mode the film doesn't have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other there's a young lady in the film that i don't think i've seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast not just because you see her nekkid or perhaps it is p the film lacks the charm and grace of the better hk wu xia films and perhaps the beauty too but i only wish hk would make them half this good anymore twins effect 2 does not give me hope that that's about to happen any time soon though tsui hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast sword in the moon is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means but it's a whole heap better than romantic warriors or legend of the evil lake perhaps better than too though i did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing obviously it's nowhere near the wonderful musa but it's a different affair altogether really will probably get a second viewing within three years which is perhaps the best indicator of how much i liked it 7 10
<START> how do two great actors foist off a piece of junk like this on film goers my only conclusion is that they and their director believe that any film in which they star just must be seen and applauded br br now to the film probably the worst thriller i have ever seen the actors showed minimal emotion the plot was reasonable for a 1 2 hour time slot not 91 minutes the fbi agent was almost a silly parody his partner was apparently struck dumb and spoke not one word to paraphrase robert redford the villain was a meaningless piece of crap the film was drawn out and meaningless the only question was whether the hero would die or not one truly bizarre part of the story the waiting family seemed to go on for at least several days the hero and antihero seemed to only take one day br br all in all waste of time
<START> the story alain a french policeman is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in nice investigating the murder he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the russian mafia helped by his brother's girlfriend alain dodges russian gangsters corrupt fbi agents while trying to find the list br br maximum risk is another one of the long list of action films that feature jean claude van damme as far as things go it is strictly formulaic the script sticks to the clichÃ©s the acting is mediocre there are some nicely done action sequences with an inventive car chase a fight in a burning building an escape through rooftops a brutal fight in an elevator fleeing his enemies over an elevated train line director ringo lam keeps everything going at a reasonable pace
<START> another 'good overcoming evil' story but with a difference this includes learning self discipline when julie goes with her teacher to a zen monastery she learns about herself she also her karate skills br br when the zen monks visit the city some awkward and comical moments ensue not uproarious but entertaining nonetheless br br next karate kid has much to say about looking within and improving what is there as well as using what you have
<START> 1957's edge of the city directed by martin ritt stars john cassavetes sidney poitier jack warden and ruby dee it's the story of a troubled man axel who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film he has a connection that gets him a job on a loading dock working for charlie jack warden a real meanie who takes from his workers and rides them hard charlie has an intense dislike for a black man t t poitier who holds the same position t t invites axel to work on his team axel defies charlie and does so axel finds a place to live and with t t his his wife dee and their son's white schoolteacher kathleen mcguire when tragedy strikes none of the men on the loading dock will talk to the police and axel has to come to grips with his values what he stands for and the meaning of friendship br br this is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being black or white it's really about the limits one puts on oneself and knowing who you are charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the dock t t teases charlie and gives as good as he gets there's no discussion of t t and axel spending time together or of t t 's son having a white teacher with whom the family also what axel a loner finds difficult is accepting any friendship or in anyone these things he learns through t t br br poitier absolutely shines in edge of the city he's warm energetic loving and smart a man with a real enthusiasm for life afraid of nothing cassavetes is excellent and plays a character totally opposite hiding in the shadows chronically depressed and always nervous br br the film leaves open what happens to axel whatever does he's a different man now br br strangely underrated and unknown film possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry young men films that came out in that era
<START> controversial german journalist jutta who herself got divers to the estonia wreck put this silly thriller together to save her investment br br donald sutherland is of course always watchable but he's only in three scenes he delivers his material perfectly as you can ask from a professional also the main lead jÃ¼rgen is at times very good br br the rest of the cast is however bad the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary or whatever she was she seems not listed in the cast is extremely bad br br the script has some nice ideas and the story is actually kind of interesting the final screenplay should have been re written a couple of more times though some scenes are plain ridiculous especially the end scenes br br the film is almost 2 hours which is about 45 minutes too long presented as a 60 minutes tv film this could have been really interesting as a two hour feature it's pretentious boring stupid and plain out silly br br jutta might be a good journalist her ideas about governments using estonia to transport military items from estonia to sweden have been concluded as true recently when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship estonia for this but as a film producer she sucks br br the director the writer and the actors suck more br br i give this film 3 10 i would've given it a 1 if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage br br but we don't even see the boat sink what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that like a werewolf movie without werewolves
<START> dear mr or whomever i may hold responsible for mr not meeting his rightful fate of being eaten alive by rabid wolverines br br i do not know you and so cannot comment on your character for all i know you give to charities and help little old ladies cross the street still i must insist for the common good that you never write another screenplay as long as you live put down the pen step away from the laptop br br if you refuse to heed the pleading of wounded brains i have watched a movie or two in my life and i believe you will find my counsel helpful br br 1 do not include love scenes in which overwrought teenage boys name the body parts of their girlfriends after us states if you must pen such a scene please do not name the breasts new york and new jersey it causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples also it is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying br br 2 do not rely solely on john hughes movies in order to reinforce class distinctions br br 3 do not bludgeon the audience over the head with exhausted clichÃ©s yes yes kelley and sam stand out in the rain and it them of their cares we get it yes the roses continue to bloom in dead mother's greenhouse even though every other plant has begun to rot it is a symbol of their love it is also very painful when applied via blunt force trauma to the backs of our heads for the love of god mr we get it we all get it all across the land amish people the hard of hearing unborn babies we all get it br br 4 do not require the actors to perform mime sequences ever no never br br 5 did i mention that you should ease up on the trite symbolism because the audience can draw the parallel between the rebuilding of the restaurant and the building of the relationship between kelley and sam without any help truly we get it br br 6 go through your script and cull out the following lines and any lines resembling them i don't know what we are anymore i don't want to lose you he's just like the rest of them and its corollary daddy you don't even know him br br 7 yes yes she's in heaven running around in a field we get it br br 8 and in other news we get it br br i have seen dozens of terrible movies in my life i never expected to suffer for your art and i would have just left the theater but an elephant with the words doomed love painted on its side fell from the sky and pinned me to my seat br br in closing your writing bites you owe me ten dollars and i hate you
<START> two years after its initial release goldeneye still sits atop the field of first person shooters for the nintendo 64 even the quake and series have not had the combination of graphic detail sound quality enemy intelligence challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again the missions each have specific objectives that force you to think as bond not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen but also to avoid cameras disable security systems rescue hostages protect the bond girl and so on q gadgets abound in this game including the famous watch the game is loosely based on the movie storyline including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie from the dam jump to the prop plane escape to the tank chase through st petersburg even the layout is preserved where possible so you'll recognize various situations if you've seen the film other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more with each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal i still have not gotten through the 00 agent levels cheats can be opened not by entering codes or pushing buttons but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame and additional characters can be opened up for the multiplayer the multiplayer is still the best among the first person shooters it's not as crisp as but it doesn't slow down nearly as much tons of options give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again and one more time just for kicks there are better games for the n64 such as zelda and all things star wars but rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first person shooter that has not and will not be surpassed until they top themselves in 2000 with perfect dark
<START> i caught this flick on the trail end of a tape i had used to capture a movie i truly wanted to wanted to see again when i saw raquel welch's name in the opening credits i decided to watch it it was actually mildly entertaining and took me back in the wayback machine to the farcical movies that hollywood churned out during the sixties much in the same genre as the current austin powers stuff oh the acting was not superb nor was the plot but it was worth watching there was some delightful scenery although ms welch provided the most pleasant of such tape it if you get the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do it is not a snoozer but it won't have you rolling in the aisles wanting more either
<START> is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie as explained by one of the main characters igor it also means fate br br indeed it's fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensue br br on the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit it starts out as an 'on the down and outs' drama road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller road movie br br there were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating i gave it an 8 the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation was unconvincing also how did they get through the gate where were the cops
<START> i thought id check this film out as i'm currently making a film about a mysterious box therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box br br before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film with actresses like cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great the acting was a sort of let down for the film the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it unbelievable br br the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was br br this film had no middle to it it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all ' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was br br lets put the bad points to one side i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end it was unexpected it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position the lighting and the effects made it look excellent this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be br br this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it parts that you would expect to be up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't it totally went against an audiences expectations even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well but this one didn't it was a creative different unusual film i thought it had potential could of been better disappointed didn't enjoy it wouldn't buy it on dvd to be honest
<START> if you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy then this film comes highly recommended kelsey gives an excellent performance here br br the film also gives you something to think about the next time a serious sub movie asks for 'silent br br
<START> i caught the first screening of driving lessons at the tribeca film festival rupert shows he can act past harry potter laura linney is amazing as the overbearing mother julie walters is hilarious as dame walton with a mouth worse than a sailor i hope that this film is picked up by an american distributor so that everyone can see it this film is not only about driving lessons but life lessons ben rupert is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life it's an amazing film from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see and everyone who can should
<START> 'til there was you is one of the worst films we've ever seen it fails in every respect jeanne tripplehorn was better as an actress in waterworld in comparison this film is when a character stumbles once or even twice in the course of a film one can understand it but character falls trips stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her in her defence each prat fall was probably blocked choreographed and rehearsed and rehearsed although this is bad enough for a film the actors dylan mcdermott and jeanne tripplehorn seem to spend most of the plot going out for a smoke or trying to find a place to smoke if the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke ok but it isn't br br however long this film runs it is too long by 10 minutes past the running time br br oh jeanne tripplehorn almost acts in a public forum meeting you almost see her break life into the character oh it's almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instinct hmm on second thought not really br br this is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch outtakes of hooper burt reynolds and even then toss a coin or go to sleep
