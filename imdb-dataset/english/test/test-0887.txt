<START> 'r xmas is one of the only films i've seen where i can almost say that simply nothing happens i felt as though i watched a drug dealing middle class couple with child walk around eat smoke converse excuse me swear through most of the film and i don't believe i'm missing the point i think this film was well directed well acted although the husband's performance was rather wooden and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner certainly kept the viewer involved but when the dust clears your left with zero just a boat load of fade outs i didn't want car chases gun violence beatings etc in fact i'm sick of violence but my goodness let's at least get a bit deeper into all these characters let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better not just show glancing shots of them as street thugs why was the dialogue so juvenile everyone spoke as if they were in junior high i believe even this side of our human race can say something other than fu sh etc the pacing and the storyline of 'r xmas i found quite interesting but the execution was plain and simple empty 4 10
<START> this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through and that's saying alot because i've seen my share of horrible movies br br but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser seriously there was not one respectable character in the entire script how fitting that the plot was equally lame lacking any intelligence whatsoever br br i can't believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity and while i haven't seen all of their other movies i've always enjoyed their performances until now it's not that the acting was bad just the entire story line was moronic
<START> 'the mill on the was one of the lesser novels by mary ann evans who wrote under the male pseudonym george eliot i tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago but was unable to finish it i'll review this film version solely on its own merits as i don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel br br the film's opening credits are printed in an old english typeface that suggests the mediaeval period and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th century setting on the other hand about halfway into the film we see a close up shot of a advertising an estate auction this is set in authentic victorian type fonts and looks very convincing most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th century england the precise location of this film's story is never disclosed but judging by the actors' accents i'd place it as somewhere in the perhaps br br the plot what there is of it involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times over a couple of decades between two rival families one wealthy and one working class i disagree with another imdb reviewer who claims that james mason has only a small role in this film mason has the largest and most central role in this drama as the scion of the wealthier family as the spoilt and petulant tom mason is darkly brooding and impetuous his performance here belongs in a better film it made me want to see 'wuthering heights' recast with mason as heathcliff br br as this is a multi generational saga something which george eliot did much better in several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors apiece child actors in the prologue adults in the main narrative the prologue of this film features a very well written scene establishing tom as wilful and bully ragging from an early age and young philip as decent and thoughtful through hard labour philip has earned a tom tries to bully it away from him but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force he wants philip to give it to him all the child actors in this movie male and female are talented and attractive unfortunately all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummy voiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults this discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material regrettably none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue br br the climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes but modern viewers in britain at least can no longer take this sort of material seriously by now practically every british comedian has done a trouble at t' mill squire comedy routine parodying precisely this subject matter so i had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face br br the character actress martita hunt is good in a small role but the opening credits in that old english typeface her as i'll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10 one point apiece for james mason's performance the early scene with the children and the authentic victorian in that
<START> technically i'am a van damme fan or i was this movie is so bad that i hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes do not let the name isaac florentine undisputed ii fool you i had big hopes for this one depending on what i saw in undisputed ii man was i wrong all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero but i guess we wont be able to see that soon as our hero keep coming with those going to a border far away town and kill the bad guys than comeback home movies i mean for god's sake we are in 2008 and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level why do your self a favor skip it seriously
<START> br br i've seen this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans at about the middle of the movie one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was boring dialogues badly choreographed fighting sequences a terribly dumb story and even worse special effects well at least the actors hadn't much to do except for looking concerned or in case they were female showing their breasts in the right light even otto who was among the audience admitted afterwards that ge could understand the disappointment of the viewers be warned folks of the cheapest fantasy movie ever
<START> director todd unexpected turn into sentimental coming out drama yields a predictable result nothing new to see here attractive but unconvincing leads these 20 somethings are supposed to be in high school dribbling out banalities about confused adolescent sexuality doesn't strike me as the best way to explore the promise of anonymous which was equally self involved but also honest raw and by comparison not all that maudlin i have no idea what to make of this drab and uninspiring movie other than to hope that finds another career sure it's unpretentious but so's mike br br no single attribute however is as awful as jim chintzy electronic score which grates non stop wall to wall for the full length of this movie if i'd seen this and heard this in a theatre i would have walked out thankfully on my laptop i could scrub and hit mute
<START> great british director christopher nolan momento insomnia directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people this proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering the two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution jeremy plays the writer and alex haw the like minded friend both are great performances this low budget movie was shot total guerrilla style with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don't have which is a clever script and creative direction an impressive debut by one of todays best directors good stuff
<START> certainly an unbelievably refined cartoon drawn in a deliciously way and sensationally in almost any respect takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and heinous monarch accordingly the kingdom or at least what we surroundings of the king's palace seems devoid uninhabited br br a few inhabitants there from the the withered underground city br br an it an allegory call it a parable only do not call it a fable br br because imdb encourages and maybe for other reasons as well i will add that this cartoon is the work of the great paul
<START> all films are worth of seeing some like and loma are best films in their genre and have reached a status of a classics in finnish cinema history br br most people have formed a impression of actor through films acted leading role in three of films which all became successes at box office and movie reviews br br it's nice to see that idea of still lives in commercials i think it was tele operator tv add where was walking in mountain fell at with hare in his arms who has seen the film knows what i am talking about is a beautiful film with great actors and good filming locations like famous small town in where the best film festival in the world is held the midnight sun film festival i recommend it for all to go there on june but remember warm clothes and raincoat
<START> unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity it has no entertainment value at all it just plain sucks i don't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then for the rest of it let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it it's really that awful and as if that's not enough there's not one scene in the movie without music noise by the end of the movie you're either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier which would at least keep you from falling asleep since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention just a lot of bad acting a few cheap and unconvincing kills no story at all it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst special effects ever it's extremely boring do not watch this movie you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone book did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked
<START> the film is annoying br br technically there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes one could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100 video editing software down to earth man on the street doesn't mean sloppy editing unfocused scenes that don't contain important statement should have been deleted the same goes for making sure that the head hand others stay in the frame my 8 years old son knows that by now br br the film is way too long the main point anti globalization is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest after the interview with james suckling i pressed the stop button what a waist of time br br the main theme just doesn't work for me anymore i've seen too many small which produce mediocre commercialized and many big that produce great and unique the movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing with more identity or the bigger ones are accused of producing or commercialized the film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones however the movie hasn't proved this claim they look at a couple of sporadic examples tie some of the big producers with fascism and provided interviews with key people well did all the small producers spent wwii in the resistance is it relevant to see that parker has a thing with the movie is very manipulative and unconvincing
<START> i must in light of the of praise for this flick from viewers assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl as lowell used to say i am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments the african queen this ain't the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much of it is taken from joyce's text imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people it's not clear to me that it's a family as one person suggested having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie absolutely nothing happens and nothing important is said but it is said at interminable length as i said the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me speaking of mysteries watch a good one rather than this
<START> minor spoilers follow br br steve allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula tragedy time comedy 1939 before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events including the blitzkrieg following the which took germany to the channel resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a france its honor before the nazi conqueror br br the stuff of romance comedy and a big dollop of serious drama yep director jean paul with a well matched and outstanding cast creates in bon voyage a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining br br viviane the eyed and beautiful isabelle adjani is france's top actress as war clouds gather over europe what an overused cliche sorry a veteran self with many affairs to her credit her inner motivation seems to be whatever is good for viviane is good for viviane following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration jean etienne gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him signals his interest in her she goes home only to tiredly encounter an ex lover who doesn't understand the word no she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and enlists another former beau the still besotted frederic gregory to help deal with the mess in her flat frederic is a novelist in expectation br br a comic accident that once again highlights almost as a public service message the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state br br the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant camille virginie ledoyen who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist professor jean marc has some bottles of heavy water he needs to get to england of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what this part is pure fiction there was never any heavy water in france in 1940 just perrier and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated br br what next peter coyote as a supposed french journalist alex be tipped off as to his name he's really an officer in the german military intelligence a spy and he used to bed viviane too and wants a reprise of their affair apparently the kind is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress br br what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast paced and enjoyable film partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on casablanca this is is a remarkably funny movie except for the heavy nazi bits br br isabelle adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal i've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few if any redeeming features and depardieu disloyal to and ready to jump ship and join the traitor is convincing as a man whose ardor for viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the republic as a human being in power at a critical moment in french history is mundanely vile br br not shown in too many theaters bon voyage should be available for purchase or rental soon see it br br 9 10
<START> i caught this movie at the cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema br br i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed br br superbly shot firmly directed it's an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynch's wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons namely that it presents a portrait of australia which is well very believable br br i have to the land down under a number of times once in the 1980's and again about 7 years ago with my wife br br i don't wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the 'crocodile hunter' on the other br br one whinge i would have preferred even more of the australia much more in fact but i also realise that there's only 1 and a half hours to do it all in ' br br overall though this movie is very very accomplished
<START> i was looking forward to this movie trustworthy actors interesting plot great atmosphere then if you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life first know it ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire which they almost did things i didn't get a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone oblivious to the consequences great riddles that fell by the wayside the promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so called criminal i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian pauls role crucial and penetrating and then basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so what run out of ideas such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road
