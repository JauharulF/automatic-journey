<START> red sonja is flawed weak and lacking even the camp ness isn't good br br there are only two good things about red sonja the costumes even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous it's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men because she was raped still choose to wear so few little clothes even when it rains and the music by ennio morricone still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable br br the story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely br br brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady i don't know who's accent is worse hers or arnie's and on top of that she can't act there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable even worse was bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role but my god he looked horrible he changed so much since his only well known role in raiders of the lost ark maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991 and by the way what was with all those raiders of the lost ark actors in this movie next to ronald lacey pat roach terry richards and appeared in a role it seemed like some kind of raiders of the lost ark reunion br br the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the sword fights even though some of them are needless and weak br br only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy genre br br 4 10
<START> i was so moved by this film in 1981 i went back to the theater four times to see it again something i have never done for another film no movie evokes the feelings of growing up in the 60's like four friends that it so closely my own experiences in the 60's is probably something that many will share jodi is radiantly beautiful and unforgetable why she didn't become a major star after this i will never know the acting by the entire cast is flawless as is steve script i always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical but alas steve is no longer here to answer that question i have all but worn out my vhs copy of this great movie highly recommended
<START> this movie is bad i saw the rated and the unrated versions they are terrible now i know it's suppose to be a low budget porn spoof of spiderman but spiderbabe is just not good at being bad good it's not funny not funny at all i wanted to laugh i tried to laugh but this movie let me down at least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to and is it me because mundae is not a great looking woman from the waist down she's okay but on the way up leaves much to be desired she does look good in that school girl outfit please if you must watch this spiderbabe rent it first rated or unrated doesn't really make any difference they're both bad to me

<START> this is one of my favourite westerns what a cast glenn ford plays his role in his usual mild controlled but firm manner ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory edward g robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and barbera stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife there is plenty of action in this western that is quite impressive the scenery is delicious and the letterbox scope photography is breath taking and the soundtrack is stereo i would say that this western had a size able budget it looks expensive one of a series of great glenn ford westerns
<START> let me state this right from the start i do not hate this show i actually quite like some aspects of it in fact when i first started to watch it i quickly became hooked i was just starting to come out of the whole anime is for kids stereotype and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued br br unfortunately after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films i can say that my overall disposition has changed and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv by the end only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it br br allow me to explain the plot for you you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine when comes out of the well again she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge justice groping in one characters case overall they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it br br while there are many many side stories and story arcs there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes br br these episodes have little to no impact on the story and rarely even on the characters in some cases some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it inuyasha shoots wind scar at enemy deflects characters gasp in horror enemy turns out to have barrier characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust br br also major spoiler the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours br br major spoiler over br br the animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent even so reused animation cells plague most action scenes and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row br br on the brighter side however all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating also the character designs appearences were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen particularly with the band of seven there is definitely no shortage of opportunities here even so i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes br br although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over and inuyasha br br bottom line definitely worth checking out but not worth watching the whole series the first 30 episodes are very clever original and enjoyable for anybody but after that it simply becomes dull and tedious watching a tv show should never feel like a chore but somehow this series accomplishes just that don't expect much from inuyasha because you will only feel let down
<START> i can't seem to find anything that is good about this miniseries why the hell would you ban chocolate when u could ban something far more practical like smoking or alcohol also the fact that its an australian program and its all set in england and everyone is faking british accents is stupid overall i think that this show is unrealistic and cheap
<START> i love this film tense with great characters the kid from is excellent as is corey feldman when the kids storm the bank it is pure adrenaline inside of the bank it becomes a bit like a lord of the flies situation where they turn on each other justin walker from clueless is wonderful i saw this on showtime while channel surfing it was a pleasant surprise james remar is also quite good here as the small town sheriff taylor nichols who i love from barcelona does a nice job too as a federal agent i recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters i was shocked to discover that roger corman was a producer on this since the film is not a b movie
<START> this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended i was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it no wonder alan moore refused to have anything to do with v for vendetta a phenomenal film after this debacle br br it's not bad in an entertaining way like showgirls it's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out plot holes the size of planets the worst script in memory horrible acting by decent actors visuals that should be great but somehow flop br br it could have been so good
<START> this movie was so awful so boring so badly miscast it took a lot of work to make what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty i love lucille ball but she absolutely stunk in this movie too old couldn't sing sounded like a truck dumping gravel even when not singing and the biggest sin of all she wasn't funny even a little the studio shot themselves in the foot with this one and for ruining what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous stage musical some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well or perhaps they were already lacking those parts that might explain it but for lucy to think she was right for a part that required singing well that's the saddest thing of all it's a very good thing to know your limitations even a legend can't come out of a stinker like this and still smell like a rose
<START> from the second the music swelled second one of the movie and it was movie hack tripe i knew i was in for a very long ride horrendously clichÃ©d i laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the ending they didn't use particularly well and the costuming and hair were kinda awful my particular favourite makeup moment is that the only way they age depardieu as far as i could see was by putting a straight hair wig on him instead of wavy i could go on about the ridiculous unsuitability of the music for a long time the movie could be improved massively by an 18th century score br br eta ah it's that horrible guy patrick doyle who's responsible for the score say no more he should not be allowed near historical movies he should stick to 20th century settings br br the visit to the notable people portion was also hilarious particularly his little visit to madame pompadour who was not particularly convincingly played br br i thought the only actor who appeared grounded in the century at hand was michael maloney as james murray he absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds he was on screen tragically he made you see what the movie could have been br br the love scenes did have some heat the two leads were stunning together br br the most awful scene for historians is where they're at the big dinner in britain before wolfe sails and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of how stands the glass around aka why soldiers why as if it's a toast absolutely excruciating failure at historicity much better to leave it out thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumour that wolfe and company sang it probably drunk not all stuffy like this bunch daft
<START> wow they told me it was bad but i had no idea br br we've started a tradition we found one copy of this movie and we just pass it from person to person whoever has the movie watches it and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique creative horrible movie hopefully it'll travel 'round the world a few times br br it's painful really painful it's even beyond so bad it's funny well okay sometimes it's so bad it's funny but most of the time it just gives you that feeling that there's something sucking at your brain from the inside br br wow watch it then pass it
<START> the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it much like star trek that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now it's time to do the same for the twilight zone br br now i was very surprised when i saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being among the best and gave it scores of 10 if this is the case then why is it that everyone i know who has seen this episode hates it as much as i do it's possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but it's also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episode br br the episode itself stars william windom and others as various archetypes a soldier a dancer etc they are all stuck in a room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the shocking truth which isn't at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame no this is a badly written and unengaging episode yes there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10 but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution
<START> poor old robert taylor other than the feds nothing much has gone his way this almost shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more it's one of those cheesy detective crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously a pity australian films particularly in the 2000 01 periods have been of exceptional quality overall but i suppose there have got to be a few misses why even make a film like this that obviously isn't going to be any good
<START> basil rathbone and nigel bruce return as sherlock holmes and dr watson in this superior tale of holmes battling the 3rd reich and the mastermind genius of professor moriarty the film opens up in switzerland as holmes is in disguise as an old he must bring dr and the bomb site to england before the germans can kidnap holmes succeeds and the germans the evil professor moriarty manages to outwit scotland yard and dennis by kidnapping the only clue left by is a list of dancing men who will break the hidden code of dancing men holmes or moriarty first can holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the german hands thereby saving england from the precision bombing techniques developed by bomb site watch and enjoy
