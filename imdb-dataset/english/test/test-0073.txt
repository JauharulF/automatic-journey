<START> sorry i couldn't disagree more with the last comments frankly i thought this was worse than carry on columbus enough said last film for the usually brilliant charles who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the highly witty level of on the buses films of which were being made at the same time were frankly funnier barbara windsor was embarrassing a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen on holiday with some non entity of a scotsman c he ain't the series miraculously on with like carry on behind and carry on england carry on dick wasn't bad but really with this film the end of the series was nigh a pity because up to this film i cant think of bad film before this
<START> i've been intending to write a review of this film for some time but only now have i actually managed to get my thoughts down for the of others br br i never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the big screen' which is a shame as it is often visually stunning but i have revisited it on video numerous times over the years enjoying it immensely every time it definitely is on my personal list of favorite movies and for more than just starring kiefer sutherland and kevin bacon two of my actors to watch ' br br perhaps i appreciate this film so much because it appeals to my slightly off kilter taste in entertainment i like my movies a bit left of center unpredictable and fresh and whether or not you believe' the story line of the film you have to admit it is different br br everyone has different tastes and opinions but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw past the surface level of this film they got caught up in technicalities why would there be green lighting in a subway ' or why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt ' and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece br br yes there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a tad this can be a very engaging film br br first a note about the artistic quality of the movie some have complained about the murky lighting and the illogical nature of the sets but for me the use of innovating lighting techniques the plastic and sheet draped sets the unusual settings in old buildings and dank dripping tunnels the use of statuary rain and billowing curtains all add a poetic flavor to this film a haunting beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions being asked about life death and forgiveness br br i will focus on just two examples in an alley scene a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus then to fade away once lighting returns to normal it is an innovative means of conveying a shift in the reality' of the moment and works beautifully we are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments contrast the warm wood bright colors golden lighting and cluttered comfort of rooms with the stark white void of nelson's both are reflective of the characters themselves nelson's lack of reflect our lack of knowledge about his past and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance his past we come to learn is one of chaos and conflict he has determined to leave that behind in favor of an uncluttered emptiness unfortunately the emptiness is also reflective of his relationships with others a realization he comes to along his personal journey of self discovery in this film br br is not your typical horror film nor is a typical drama or suspense movie it is rather more of an amalgamation of all having the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex suspenseful plot br br this is an ensemble piece and the cast does an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters your immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well established the female ice queen the slightly neurotic the playboy and the socially conscious nice guy' etc however as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out they take on multiple dimensions and depth br br most interesting of all is sutherland's character of nelson nelson is not a character that is easy to like indeed he is a bit of a b tard a master manipulator who definitely places self interest above all else yet sutherland plays him with a hint of insecurity that lends him a certain appeal as events unfold you come to realize that much of nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man burdened by a terrible secret br br by revealing bits and pieces of nelson's complex personality throughout the film the writers directors and cast gradually lead you towards a greater understanding of and sympathy for him the character who started out as a jerk' becomes important and valued in his own right as you learn to his previous behavior in light of new information your journey of discovery with nelson reflects the characters own journeys towards self understanding as they too come to realize that everyone has value and everything we do matters ' br br which leads to my final comment although many of the posters here have picked up upon the theme of defying death few seem to have touched upon what i see as the main premise of the movie the importance of forgiveness and the need to be cognizant of all you do because it does matter ' br br
<START> documentary content amazing man amazing movement he started amazing stories most of them yet to be really told br br celluloid treatment nike ad sorry ain't got nothing else to say about this but that you can say all you want about the dire circumstances in the favelas but if you attempt to support that claim with flashy and romanticized images and camera work of that life the humbleness necessary to show this life as an outsider filmmaker goes out the window and with that goes the legitimacy of the narrative besides that the time space continuum in the film is all off and i'm not necessarily against that in films as a tool but here it serves only to confuse the viewer into wondering what was said when thus leading me to the question is this a documentary or a docudrama br br blogspot com
<START> if there was justice in the cinematic universe director lewis would never be allowed to set foot on a movie set again it would seem inconceivable that anyone who spent two full decades in an editing room where ls started his movie career could be so utterly devoid of any sense of pacing or dramatic staging but this film is damning evidence br br as bad as it is it is fascinatingly so from the opening scene where a nurse is clad in a costume appropriate only for a porno film or a skit on a mexican variety show the viewer is compelled to see just how low it can go the answer isn't far away as in the next scene we move to a funeral parlor where the next stunning fashion statement comes in a sexy off the shoulders black dress worn by one of the mourners br br aggressively inappropriate costuming isn't the film's only flaw the dialog is a treat for connoisseurs of bad writing you turn my tears into wine is a sample gem the actor deserves an oscar for delivering that one with a straight face br br the director reinforces every cheeseball scene with what is possibly the soundtrack score ever recorded which veers from embarrassingly maudlin in the dialog scenes to cheesy wannabe in transitional scenes br br the script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason and story beats are doled out as if with a broken br br let's not forget this is a horror film though our characters find themselves in a forest wherein lurks dr chopper and his two scary who are supposed to be some kind of but look exactly like valley girls with fake blood beneath their shags i've honestly seen scarier make up on eight year olds out trick or treating on halloween br br and again we get a whiff of the costume designer's handiwork as valley ghoul one prances around in a pseudo victorian while her buddy wears a nondescript ensemble that might have been almost fashionable in less hip corners of the 1980s br br dr chopper makes the big fashion statement though looking like a cowboy who got lost in the woods on his big black harley clad from head to toe in black s m leather br br if this sounds intriguing by all means check it out there is plenty of side splitting and belabored dialog like the precious elephant's graveyard scene or the intellectual discourse on br br to be fair the cinematography is good considering what was put before the camera and the actors strive with wildly extreme results to make something from a scrap heap of clichÃ©s and inanities you do have to wonder if they were really really stupid or just blindly desperate not to walk off the set after catching one glimpse of the ridiculous looking villains with their 99 cent store weapons
<START> i don't understand why more people have not commented on this other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it it's an amazing cast of characters one after another after another all done by the guy who wrote the play if you don't like filmed plays you may not like this after all plays usually don't look good on tv but it's a one man show that will have you paying attention throughout highly recommended
<START> a college professor is working on creating zombies and wouldn't you know it things go horribly wrong next thing you know the whole campus is overrun thank goodness there's a pair of uber commandos trained for just such a situation too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron commandos lead by a rapper he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin' da homies in da hood the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene the male and female moron commandos share the same locker room and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties hey if you can't make a good movie at least you can have women in their underwear my hat's off to the film makers br br so after much discussion of how well prepared these moron commandos are for the job bosnia afghanistan iraq they all get killed off in fairly short order their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end human or zombie can't tell flip on the lights no moron commando protocol requires them to walk up to the person making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand and well you know the drill the demise of sergeant major sticky is especially fun my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie i've ever seen luckily and again hats off to the filmmakers the hottest babe among the moron commandos manages to survive her and the female uber commando both wind up in tight t shirts for the remainder of the movie now this is how a military operation should be performed there's a bunch of running around punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber commandos being unable to get through a simple grating it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves and even though we've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell they're good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go br br a few other funny bits the paris hilton gag the can you hear me now gag and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being on another chuckle is provided by mr who can't seem to pronounce the word toe no kit br br overall it's somewhat amusing could have used some more interesting characters but for a sci fi channel original i was mildly impressed
<START> i received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday which he had obviously picked up for 99p from a bargain video bin br br never have i been so frustrated when watching a film it was tedious adam west was wasted literally and in retrospect i cannot recall a single thing about it my lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second the credits rolled we smashed up the cassette and hung the tape around the living room just for good measure we set fire to the cover
<START> river's edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something perhaps no movie ever made has captured the of young suburban inertia like this frightening movie given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all fantastic
<START> the sounds in the movie were so mundane and ridiculous seriously banging on the door hinges for about 30 minutes really crunches your teeth and makes your head hurt br br i love bad puns more than the next guy but come on no blood on our hands being said about a million times by matt character and when matt dillon's character shoots the bum the lead character which i fail to remember his name because i don't really think anyone cares gets blood on his hands literally br br the background music with the heavy metal guitar ringing an a chord for about 5 minutes isn't my idea of music come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this garbage
<START> this show is terrible i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains this is not entertaining improvisational acting it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene i have actually done improv work as an actor and this show is not improv br br what the audience is actually laughing at if they're actually laughing at this show at all it looks quite fake is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights the dumb completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at and if it's not part of the scene the actors will tell them that it's wrong i find this show is disgrace to the art and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway which had great talent great improv games and on top of everything else didn't make me want to change the channel
<START> being an unrelenting non stop over the top explosive melodrama this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced and utterly unbelievable in every way the pace is constantly fever pitched and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria it is nigh unwatchable and a stain nay a blotch on the careers of everyone involved br br the wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself resulting in a movie where you just go come on all the time the setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously i can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10 br br if you want to see a good asteroid movie see deep impact which is intense sensitive and thoroughly engrossing everything armageddon is not
<START> spoilers feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love frances austen sandy dennis keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends but for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length as for frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them br br one early evening as frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man michael burns sitting alone in the cold pouring rain feeling that he's homeless and alone after her friends leave frances goes outside to the park and offers the young man shelter at her place until the rain subsides and even to stay over for the night at a guest bedroom that she has you can see right away that frances is more interested in just having the young mans safely out of the cold and rain then she wants to have him as a friend lover or even play toy all for herself and as the movie progresses you see that you were right br br a really amazing performance by sandy dennis that in a way is very much like that of kathy bates' academy award performance in the movie misery that was made in 1990 some twenty one years later frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless and later when she meets him mute sees the perfect person for her to have as a true friend he's in no way her equal or better then her like the friends that she has doctors lawyers indian chiefs and thus is totally dependent on her it later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person that frances thought that he is it's when she slowly finds out that he really doesn't need her as well as him manipulating her instead the other way around it sets off something in mind that turns out to be a compulsion of murderous proportions br br a really weird film by director robert altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind actress sandy dennis is perfect as the dr jekyll and miss hyde personality in her acting as the lonely but at the same time dangerous frances austen and it's a pity that not only didn't she get an academy award for her role in the film but wasn't even nominated for it br br like most robert altman movies there seems to be a lot of improvisation among the actors in the movie and ad lib dialog especially between the young man's sister nina susanne benton and her boyfriend nick david garfield the only thing in the movie that i found confusing is when we see frances go to a city clinic to have a full exam and tells the doctor that she expects to get married very soon was her husband to be the young man staying at her apartment but besides that the movie sticks to the story pretty well and the ending is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man when he finally in the end realizes that frances is not only a bit off the wall but murderously insane as well
<START> has a formidable reputation within lovecraftian circles and now i know why br br is based on a manga title which unbelievably is allegedly better than the film and follows the bizarre events a typhoon in an isolated japanese town i'm not about to tell you anything that happens in this film because it is an absolute must see movie i watched it for the first time last night and i was blown away it shot into the my top movies of all time and leap pans labyrinth as the best fantastic movie literally and that has been released in the last decade br br this movie is very lovecraftian in nature without formally having any direct connection to the mythos it has been made in the same way that lovecraft composed his stories it exudes power as an aura of not quite right here' intensifies through a brooding phase to dread and ultimately horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and the cinematography this is indeed a weird tale par excellence br br simply stunning
<START> i think i am some kind of road runner fan i don't care how predictable it is i laugh anyway is predictable most of the time although it is pretty ingenious at the same time as well of course the road runner is chased by the coyote and of course the coyote fails to catch the road runner with every new attempt the plans the coyote comes up with are very funny you see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not disappointed well one time you are sort of disappointed what you think will happen does not but it makes the joke even funnier br br if you like the road runner shorts you will love this one the predictable gags work and the animation is great and pretty original at times
<START> i wanted to love this film so badly i really did but it was a horrible disappointment br br i read jennifer novel in 1996 and was enthralled by the story in fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time mind you the book had much more depth than this movie in plot and emotional resonance it made you care about the characters it painted a complete picture of phoebe unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the film br br though beautiful and showing some promise in her burgeoning career jordana brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script and christopher eccleston wolf was just an awful choice for the role of wolf both physically and what an awkward looking couple wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character and more physically alluring like he was in the book what's more the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced br br cameron diaz however deserves utmost praise for her performance she took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life a real spirit she is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie it's too bad her talent was squandered on this forgettable film br br in the book to movie category this is a dreadful translation almost as bad as message in a bottle with kevin costner but don't get me started on that one br br i am not usually so harsh in my critiques but i was so disappointed here because i really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right it did not deliver br br
