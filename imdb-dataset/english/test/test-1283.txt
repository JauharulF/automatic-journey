<START> they are good stand up comedians young not ugly have money the girls love them the audience is appreciating everything there doing br br and then they made this film br br no story at all some jokes were old in the fifties the acting is awful save your money for something useful like a gift for your girlfriend
<START> a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm including the daughter goes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest when the search and rescue mission is called off the ceo harlan knowles lance henriksen puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods br br oy what a mess this film was it was a shame because for one it stars lance henriksen who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film it suffers from two major flaws and they're probably both writer director jonas fault this film which i'll be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing i've ever seen next to alone in the dark 2005 and constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay let's try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other improvise non sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible br br the potential was there despite the rip off aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project 1999 and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator 1987 ed wood like exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if and fellow writer chris would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships the monster's lair had some nice production design specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers 2001 if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective br br but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made for some reason thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so on br br for some reason he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway br br for some reason he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc he just cuts to them at random for that matter the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random important events either never or barely appear and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes br br for some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because it's not that important the monster's intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another way br br for some reason there is a whole character mary mancini left in the script even though she's superfluous br br for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft core porno scene even though the motif is never repeated again br br for some reason characters keep calling harlan knowles mr h like they're stereotypes of asian br br for some reason insists on using the blurry cam and cam for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesn't look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle filter or anything else other than bad cinematography br br i could go on but you get the idea br br i really wanted to like this film better than i a henriksen fan i'm intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level but i just couldn't every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end made some other awful move in the end my score was a 3 out of 10
<START> first of all those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film even those like me who are desensitized to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should beware i'm not telling you to steer away from the film but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material definitely not a pleasing film to watch but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value but i must admit when i watched the film for a second time i had to skip to the next chapter when the razor blade scene came up br br the main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters i can think of but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act in one scene she stuffs broken glass in one of her student's jacket pocket after being dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience the student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood stained hand next to the razor blade scene that disturbed me most the student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she when she gets word that her daughter won't be able to play she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an br br though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part i felt more needed to be explained about isabelle huppert's character when a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself you want to understand the root of the problem the movie establishes that she wants desperately to be loved then why the hateful attitude towards everyone why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain br br the acting is terrific and i liked the glossy stylized lighting altogether it's not a film i'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained but as i said it's very intriguing and i'm sure if i watched it a few more times i'd be able to spot certain subtleties that'll shed more light on aspects of the film i didn't realize initially br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> this film shows just how much fun filmmaking can be it's all in good fun as it plays out a no holds barred comedy assault on the star trek genre in hick trek the moovie a group of good 'ol boys are on a mission to stop a group of renegade cats out to destroy the entire redneck federation br br can captain jerk stop the villainous fluffy with the power of the r s s and it's cow ray she may have nine lives but he has ten bullets this cult classic previously only seen at scifi conventions is a party favorite lots of funny moments
<START> i can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film so i must be in the minority for liking this film so much well i am right and everyone else is wrong just kidding i guess i like it because i am a psychology teacher and i really liked the brooding character played by ryan while he truly is dangerous as well as very menacing you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma and wow did ryan do a really good job portraying this man you really find yourself feeling for ida lupino as he destroys her life so with such intense acting and menace why is the movie rated relatively low well probably because it isn't exactly believable but boy is it entertaining and creative give it a try and don't believe the score of 6 4 it's a lot better than that
<START> after looking for this for months and then accidentally buying it cheap it was disappointing i heard about it on a dvd r site and it sounded crazy br br but no what i got was a pretty bad martial arts movie the kung fu ing wasn't too bad but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie seem really really long much longer then it's 85 minute runtime br br on a positive note the ape was funny for a couple of seconds especially when i think they took the only close up of it's face from another movie and the black guy who pops up half way through was funny because of the one line he said which singlehandedly made all black people look like complete simpletons br br but it wasn't enough sadly br br 4 10
<START> this movie is just downright horrible the movie was only an hour long and for about 25mins of the movie was just useless random clips that don't even connect to the movie the storyline is completely retarted my 5 year old cousin could probably write a better script i don't understand how someone could fund the production of a film like this horrible this is definitely the most horrid movie i've ever seen in my entire existence i think the casting director just took some random kids from off the street to act in this movie the directing acting producing and writing for this film are all really bad i feel bad for the people who wasted money funding this garbage u couldn't pay me to watch this crap again
<START> the patriot is a well thought out well produced film that will draw the viewer into the story directly and keep them involved to the very end granted it is not in the same vein as under siege et al but this is definitely the trademark film of what might be described as seagal's second era of films not so much action movies with a nod to a story thrown in for good measure but a good story matched with a point and injected with some of seagal's action sequences is this the kind of film that hardcore action junkies will enjoy probably not but for those of us who not only like our action but also can appreciate a well told story this is a big step forward for seagal it's almost like the transformation clint eastwood made as he tried to step out from underneath the shadow of his dirty harry series either man had he continued in the singular direction they were headed would have forever been in in specific role and guaranteed the brevity of their careers
<START> well 1st off i haven't seen silence of the lambs yet but i think that i would have become sick if i would have seen it before this piece not from the gruesome violence but from the lack of everything else anthony hopkins was very good as hannibal and i really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but from the reaction of the audience around me the film was filled with cliches from silence which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen br br now i heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out he did it but only in 2 sequences i mean if you want it to be gruesome and i mean so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that you need more than 2 sequences i always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will take you to another place and time or either go over the top which most of the time is done in bad taste but this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times br br anthony hopkins and julianne moore are the stars of the movie right well with the exception of hopkins i didn't feel that way who cared about the stupid italian police officer i definatley didn't so really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway i mean come on who cares br br in a nutshell the movie is good if you want to see lector and starling once again but if you're going for a really good thriller you'll jump once and be grossed out maybe twice depends on your level br br thinking about how much money this movie will bring in there will probably be another hannibal made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall if you must see it wait and save the 3 50 4 00 and get it on video don't spend the big bucks on this film
<START> i expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election cbs's last shot at throwing a dig at bush this movie was just awful yet i'm still watching it minor spoiler i think cbs got the same people who provided the to do the semi cut in half sequence what is with the bad boyfriend storyline can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a ed wood movie who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing if you want to see decent b grade disaster movies then see earthquake flood etc avoid this mess of a movie hint to cbs avoid showing us this crap give us re runs of csi instead better acting and more believable
<START> bali was shown at the washington dc filmfest april 15 2005 the director was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards br br as always i think aishwarya did a fantastic job i can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy but would that really be realistic in 1904 possible maybe realistic i'm not so sure i think her interpretation was valid although there could certainly be other ways to do it br br i hate to use the word but this was the most inaccessible of the indian movies i have seen so far i know a fair amount of indian history hindu religion etc but the level of detail here was far beyond me clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with hinduism and its customs esp as they were c 1904 i missed a lot of things one of them being the fact that the mother in law would want in the house as sort of a counter weight to her daughter in law br br spoilers had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me first the original version was 20 minutes longer so what was left out apparently three main things a beginning segment where aishwarya leaves e bengal for calcutta according to the director different characters are speaking w vs e setting up some of the political comments later of course all of this is lost in the hindi version and certainly to a non indian like me it wouldn't have mattered anyway but a set up of the situation sure would have next there was a segment where was writing a poem a sign of her independence etc finally some more business about the jewellery so although some people think it was too long i think the original longer version would have been clearer br br the women's hair was apparently another sign again the mother in law had short hair short hair for hindu widows her sister also a widow had longer hair more modern and of course aishwarya had extremely long waist length hair rejection of status of widowhood br br the ending really threw me all of a sudden who had never had a political thought is writing a political manifesto whoa explained that he was in locarno at a film festival when the subtitles were done the subtitles use the word country throughout letter gosh said a more appropriate word would have been i forget his exact word something like self or independence she was talking about her own liberation and finding herself not about bengal india and the british so why does just disappear the day after finding again apparently because during her stay on the she realizes that she doesn't need a man any man to define complete her she can just be herself so she rejects who she threw herself at a few months before and just goes off of course i'm not sure how she buys her next meal but that's another question br br the red shawl again she buys represents revolution as well as passion i'm not 100 sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman but perhaps she is rejecting passion revolution the binoculars which uses throughout the movie to watch and the boat on the etc she is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but can't have at the end i missed this she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter showing that she doesn't need them any more she's going off to lead her own life br br finally the tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending apparently tagore wrote this as a serial hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits but at the end he sold out to conservatism and had kneel down at the feet of and begging their forgiveness one of his students wrote to tagore taking him to task for his sell out ending and tagore replied with his apology for the ending in the movie of course goes in the other direction
<START> the captain and have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion i've noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information i've found on the net i've been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd whatever the truth may be i'm very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren't included hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras i recommend this dvd to any c t fan
<START> i know it sounds crazy but yes i am a huge fan of house party 1 and 2 and proud of it i hated part 3 and then here comes part 4 i was like are you kidding me with this kid 'n play are nowhere to be found in this movie and that would've been okay had they not foolishly entitled the movie house party 4 as if it was in any way shape form or fashion related to its predecessors every time this movie comes on late at night on usa i shoot my tv with a rifle quite frankly it really is just that atrocious hurling br br as the only remaining fan of kid 'n play that will actually admit to being a fan tee hee hee i was appalled remember that stupid little boy group immature they snuck their way into house party 3 okay fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they're not even the same kids from part 3 confused house party fans do yourself a favor and stick to house party 1 and 2 and class act beyond that everything else is ridiculous
<START> so seagal plays a dea detective named john hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into surprise surprise colombia not to brag or anything but my father was born and raised in colombia hence my last name and now he's a doctor in california so no matter what the movies would have you believe there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of colombia br br at any rate in a drug bust gone bad hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked colombian prostitute inspiring him to go to confession somewhere that i have never seen him go before in any of his movies before or since it was actually pretty interesting seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt whether by a stripper or by a lover never the slightest bit of interest from him he's all get the bad guys all the time br br but in the confession booth he confesses to having lied sold drugs evidence and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars i hope i'm not getting in trouble with god by telling you the priest tells him to go to his family so he decides it's time to retire from the force br br the next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper thin characterization characteristic of seagal's films marked for death is the story of seagal against a band of mystic jamaican drug dealers and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylight br br hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach max a minimal effort by keith david and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread locked sitting right there in the bleachers crack to some bookworm looking high school girls br br maybe i just had a sheltered experience in high school but i didn't know crack dealers and hung out at school in the middle of the day at any rate it's not long before hatcher learns how evil these guys are they're not just crack to high school kids but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs they engage in stare downs with max and since that's not enough his 13 year old niece died in their br br ah ok we get the picture i'm sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women and maybe steal candy from children too just for good measure is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are 13 year old niece died in their wow br br anyway not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie name calling where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue but they also don't know how they should act br br the leader of the drug dealers is named and i suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is is a cartoonish jamaican man with these bright bizarrely green eyes which i am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head his favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever he's yelling at this guy likes to get so into guys' faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don't touch all i could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath br br man they do not want you to forget that these guys are jamaican by the way their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie it's nearly impossible to understand them not that it matters it doesn't matter what they're saying all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug related thing they're just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people the movie must have been a huge hit in br br my biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics particularly of the bad guys as i've described are spectacularly goofy even for a seagal film they are so cartoonish and weird that it's impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b movie creation something slapped together to provide fodder to whom seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smack down retribution br br but there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird for example a mystic i guess you would call her at one point puts some kind of curse on by if i remember correctly spitting of onto a live rooster that's hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of hmm interesting br br sadly it's this same woman that warns hatcher that his family has been marked for death by these people meaning they've got some voodoo hex on them not to belittle anyone but if i was told that my family had been cursed by people like that i would just laugh at it hatcher doesn't strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses br br but the set up as you can see is pretty standard for a seagal film unique villains i guess you could say although not very impressive definitely the weirdest film of seagal's early
<START> i first saw this film in the theater way back in the 40s when i was a kid and always remembered the ending there is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed something just resonates with them this is one of those films and i agree with another reviewer who said fritz lang should have directed more westerns to add to it i have always liked randolph scott and robert young in fact robert young stars in what i consider my favorite movie if i have to name just one not an easy thing to do that film is northwest passage it led me to the superb historical novels of kenneth roberts western union likewise led me to reading zane grey's novel which in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where i like the movie better than the novel not that grey's novel is a bad one i just like the movie story better the movie in no way resembles the novel it is a completely different tale one of the biggest departures from a book i have seen br br i can't add much to the other reviews except to say i agree with many of them i too wish it would be released on dvd whatever happened to randolph scott happened to the best of me
