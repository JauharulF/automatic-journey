<START> once again has provided us with a top quality film this director is amazing and he's proven that he's equally talented and effective when crossing genres br br the excellent character development of the movie through dialogue and personality quirks but with more subtle details as well ramon's father's gaze allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound the visuals are at times simple at times stunning the dream to the beach and i think films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music it matched the film's varying moods flawlessly br br more than just a film about euthanasia which in itself is an important issue this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life albeit in a quite limited way and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die the overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well timed quips of humor which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel br br although clearly in favor of euthanasia this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of ramon's friends and family most poignant was ramon's father when he said despondent there's only one thing worse than losing a child that the child wants to die br br excellent writing acting directing cinematography music 10 10
<START> i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely direct contact photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes br br de merde whoops de mer features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish which is never explained have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies but if that has anything to do with this movie's theme ray neglects to say so i was much more impressed by this movie's title cards which in french manage to include rhymes a pun belle and some br br as so often in ray's work there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie unfortunately the photography is largely so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her i'll rate this mess one point out of 10
<START> to paraphrase birch i kind of like this movie it's the exact opposite of everything i hate in a film br br this obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign and a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens where instead the focus is on character development has a limited target audience whoever heard of a mature teen movie br br but if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the dvd you could do a lot worse my teacher's wife is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings br br jason london as high school senior todd boomer is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in the man in the moon and dazed and confused he is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast tia carrere in the title role is a revelation she can act as todd's calculus tutor and love interest christopher mcdonald as the teacher in a nice self parodying performance and alexondra lee as todd's best friends and jeffrey as his father br br as someone commented earlier this is a mature teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful at least by traditional happy ending standards even todd's parents are indifferent to each other with his father panting after the title character and his mother leslie literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance the london carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find br br but the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends there is no overwrought melodrama here just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing they actually manage to pull off a believable three person relationship perhaps the first one in cinema history br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> slayer starts in the south american rain forest where captain hawk casper van dien his men are attacked by a bunch of vampires they barely manage to escape with their lives jump forward six months later hawk is called to see colonel weaver lynda carter who informs him there has been other reported sightings of vampires that his ex wife her dr laurie williams jennifer o'dell has gone out there on an expedition to study beetles worried she ask's hawk to take a squad of soldiers back to south america officially provide back up to captain grieves kevin his men while at the same time unofficially look for laurie not get killed by the vampires who have decided to venture out of the caves into the civilised world br br edited written directed by kevin vanhook this is yet another poorly made sci fi channel original which just isn't very good in any respect the humourless script has nothing going for it as far as i could see it's one of those modern vampire films which decides to pick choose the 'traditional' vampire film lore rules it wants to use like these vampires can be killed with stakes through the heart have fangs but at the same time can freely walk around in sunlight they don't sleep in coffins the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it's all very dull bland lifeless the story is poor just rather stupid the character's are terrible the dialogue is forgettable there's very little here to recommend slayer also tries to have some sort of ecological message as the head vampire claims they are only starting to kill human beings because of their systematic destruction of the rain forest where they have lived in secret for centuries unfortunately there's no conviction there is more like a throwaway line to fill the time than a serious statement there isn't enough exploitation content is a rather unsatisfying way to spend 90 minutes of your time the makers don't even do anything with the jungle setting hell i didn't expect predator 1987 but i hoped for a bit more than this br br director vanhook has made several horror films all of which i have seen have been equally poor i'm sorry but he does nothing here turns in a throughly forgettable looking feeling film there's no atmosphere or tension as for genuine scares forget about it the gore is restrained there are some bitten necks a bit of spraying blood but it's nothing we haven't seen before or has much impact there's also a huge vampire monster creature at the end but it doesn't look that impressive it gets itself killed far too easily br br with a supposed budget of about 2 000 000 this actually had a decent sized amount of money spent on it but it's still a rubbish film it's reasonably well made but nothing special or memorable the acting sucks i'm sorry but that's the way i saw it br br slayer is yet another poor stupid boring made for tv sci fi channel rubbish that i simply can't recommend not to be confused with the rather fine one time british 'video nasty' gore film the slayer 1982 which is 100 times better than this so track that down watch that instead
<START> national velvet tells the story of velvet brown a young english girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious grand national horse race the film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents br br while national velvet is a family film that fact shouldn't deter anyone who typically views such films with derision the film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family not just attention addled youngsters it even managed to land five oscar nominations hardly a sign of off for a general audience br br anne revere in the part of mother actually won an oscar for her performance she was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12 year old elizabeth taylor who steals the show she is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years also on board are oscar winner donald crisp as father mickey rooney as former jockey mi taylor and angela lansbury in one of her earliest film roles as older sister br br the film's lustrous technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film's two oscars additionally the film was nominated for its direction by clarence brown cinematography art direction the score by ten time oscar nominee herbert stothart is also worth mentioning though it went br br all in all national velvet is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating i realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on
<START> it's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what's happen to be a very waste of talents the plot is clichÃ© the directing is too self conscious and the characters are almost caricatures one of the most disappointing aspect of this film is gerard depardieu's performance in the english version this movie was shot in french and english at the same time although he is one of the best actor in the film he gives the worst performance of them all i must say that bianca gervais come very close though br br on a more positive note i must say that the newcomer juliette gives an amazing performance in both version unfortunately that the only good thing i remember about this film br br by the way i must apologize for my not very good english
<START> i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before br br there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en couer de to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special this film is one of them a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in and monica while monica is very beautiful is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits br br i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters' own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched br br like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without the life out of it with the hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation americans make brilliant films but not of this type perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english version br br for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss for those who can read then you would be yourself to miss films like this br br i would describe this as neo franco noir but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist i think i saw him doing an add for four and twenty pies he thinks is a type of french it is arty in the way that pulp fiction is arty but with more gallic faire br br 10 out of 10 with every viewing and has anyone got phone number she is the perfect french salad dressing
<START> like a very expensive buffy episode peppered with plenty of humor lots of wire and stunt kung fu the twins effect goes on the list of classic must see hk films the vampires have a cool blend of hopping ghost type and the pretty boy european style if you get the opportunity to see this one in the theatre it is worth a 30 minute drive otherwise buy the import dvd before someone screws it up by giving it a bad dub
<START> this film and i use that term loosely reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at eighteen months p u stinky br br like that joke this movie can only appeal to the very young the very immature or the very stupid br br that said there are a few bright spots br br the effects where the majority of the reputed 100 million went are kinetic and convincing i mean as convincing as those kind of kinetic cgi effects can be the cgi baby effects are not great but i imagine those are very hard to do well although for a hundred million bucks they could have been better br br moose the dog from frasier phoned in his usual exemplary performance steven wright did well with a small part alan cummings was well alan cummings as villain which we've seen before and bob hoskins as odin was unrecognizable but enjoyable br br the actress playing mrs avery was cute as a button as you'd expect and jamie kennedy stunk as you'd expect his best role so far was in the scream trilogy not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy and in three kings he should stick perhaps to more subtle forms of comedy jim carrey he ain't br br the writing and direction were if anything worse than kennedy's performance i semi remember one clever though seven year old clever line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the memorable quotes section something about proposed costume being the crappiest crap in it was a second grade joke but sort of funny in context br br over all since there's nothing lower than a one i give this film a one
<START> i got this movie out a week after the death of ichikawa kon i suppose if there is one way to mark the passing of a great director its to raise a glass of wine to him while watching one of his greatest movies ichikawa had one of the finest careers in japanese film but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near contemporaries such as ozu and kurosawa he was a little younger than them but not by much he is one of those directors who defies auteur theories its likely that his wife who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was but at his best he was as good as any japanese film maker at the time in particular he had great technical skills allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner but in terms of theme this movie could hardly be simpler war is hell no really its seriously hell br br fire on the plain doesn't follow the normal war genre rules there is no real beginning we start as the wretched tamura who is a regular private although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others at one stage it is shown he understands english but he clams up when the others ask him how he knows it is ordered to hospital as his unit is already in an appalling state the soldiers are defeated and starving to death they are no longer an army just a rag bag group of refugees hunted by the locals and pretty much ignored by the americans who have bigger fish to fry hunger and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness br br in typical ichikawa style its not all just grim its oddly funny in parts a very black humour of course br br the high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography the characters in all their humanity but also their complete loss of humanity are all too believable this is that rare film one which will refuse to erase itself from your head even if you want to forget it
<START> can't liberals like alec baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004 the ridiculous lame swipes at walmart non union workers george w bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional gwb accent that character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen as the credits roll the sour grapes continue as special thanks are given to ken lay and other ceos from enron and let me clue you in to something if you put all your money into one company's stock you're an idiot we don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us that what a waste of jim carrey's talent from the trailer i expected a completely different movie what i got was a 90 minute commercial on how to scare people into not investing for their own future keep them stupid and keep them dependent on government no wonder hollywood is in trouble and can't make a decent movie anymore maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once although i shouldn't be surprised since jane fonda was cast in the original
<START> anyone remember the first etc back when it was about making crazy cool stuff rather than watching bam act like a douchebag spoiled 5 year old super rock star wannabe br br the show used to be awesome however fame and wealth has led him to believe that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic more than actual cool stuff that used to be in ex br br the acts are so repetitive there's like nothing new except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments the only things we see is bam so busy showing us how much he doesn't care how much money he got or whatsoever br br i really got nothing much left to say except give us back cause bam suck br br i enjoy watching steve o knoxville etc a thousand times more
<START> best movie by far very funny very surrealistic if bunuel made a movie starring buster keaton as krusty the clown it would look like this br br brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other schneider movies especially helmut as the sidekick of andreas who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though and of course helge himself as baxter is absolutely incredible br br p s if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that ist painting
<START> me and a buddy rented this movie the other day at first look it seemed to be another teen movie which was also what we hoped for being fans of simple horror and comedy br br it seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible it quickly into something that holds a lot of potential unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground we had watched it for something that seemed like 1 hour when i finally half sleeping managed to say dude this movie sucks it was only 35 minutes actually dude agreed br br the problem is the movie is simply not funny it was undoubtedly supposed to be funny but it failed it failed in a way that made me sad it kind of reminds me of myself i had the potential to be anything i wanted and instead i ended up watching cheap horror funny movies all the time i pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart its so sad all that potential and nothing
<START> i couldn't believe this was the same director as antonia's line br br this film has it all a boring plot disjointed flashbacks a subplot that has nothing to do with the main plot what so ever and totally uninteresting characters it was painful to watch soooo painful
