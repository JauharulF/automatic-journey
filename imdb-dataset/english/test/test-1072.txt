<START> i have seen this movie last week during the berlin film festival and had medium high expectations the director is bertrand tavernier and i was familiar with some of his previous work in french cinema i actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies the cast tommy lee jones john goodman peter mary steenburgen i was looking forward to see all this talent on screen i wasn't familiar with the book it's based upon and i hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand but i was told that it was an investigation movie set in the deep south we've seen a lot of those in the past maybe this one's gonna be as good as the others br br 2 hours later the end titles appear thank god it was over the plot is beyond comprehension if you've read the book you have a significant advantage there were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot arcs we didn't understand a thing the accents my god tommy lee jones' accent is decent but i still have nightmares from mary cajun french singing poor casting in my opinion i can't believe old man tommy lee jones can beat the crap out of a linebacker built goon and i'm not afraid of john goodman who were these people we barely understand who all these characters are and what they do there's a bait shop tommy lee jones has a girl from guatemala the comedic attempts were pathetic the funniest thing about the movie was probably its action and suspense scenes they were horrible no thrills bad acting can tommy lee jones make different faces or is he like derek zoolander and then there's the sci fi stuff no spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird br br i usually don't write any comments on imdb but i thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that i felt compelled to share my opinion but that's just me
<START> subject matter quantum physics and stephen hawking br br soundtrack phillip glass br br have i died and gone to heaven br br you will be enraptured
<START> as far as i know i've seen most of lucio fulci's films with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on dvd now and i would have to say this was his best pre zombie offering in fact it beats out his later movies hands down this is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small italian town out in the middle of nowhere where young boys are dying mysteriously it's no mystery how they died i guess it's more who's doing it is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town who used to do a lot of drugs is it the village idiot who gets nabbed early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time you'll only know if you watch and watch you should for this is a top notch mystery thriller or should i say a giallo i've seen this before but it's been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time for those of you that only know lucio fulci for his zombie flicks well open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the monsters in this are human they're as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films 9 out of 10 stars see it please
<START> lina is a bright solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with johnnie a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money they get married but almost at once lina is subjected to addiction to lying gambling and getting into debt despite his flaws she is unable to resist his charming manner until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her br br this is a good movie well made with an attractive cast a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history okay that's maybe going too far but not by much lots of films change the ending of a book great expectations the shining etc but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless the story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking and what she knows about him to kill her it should end as it does in francis anthony berkeley's book before the fact with him attempting to murder her the reason it doesn't is that the studio forced hitch to the ending one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing hitch was canny and did what he was told this was only his third film in hollywood knowing that if he played the game sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties but that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending this is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme does anyone really know their husband or wife that well the script is excellent with many off guard moments such as when lina's father dies and johnnie assumes she's crying about it a finely judged performance by grant who never played a villain again and fine photography throughout culminating in the famous glass of milk shot fontaine won an oscar for this performance although personally i prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier wife role in rebecca i would like to rate this movie higher but i really can't forgive that ending this is what happens when movies are made for money not love which i guess is curiously the theme of the film itself look fast for hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter
<START> this movie was cheesy and it was more than that it was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla i had to see how bad it was because of the title before this guy turns into a gorilla he gets married i was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla she is now the wife of the gorilla she should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense there are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave this isn't just a b movie it's more like a z movie i didn't even see any bananas for a wedding gift oh right he wasn't cursed yet
<START> i saw this movie just recently and i said to myself this movie is bad william shatner is a great actor but he is no director br br it's not just that the acting is bad it's terrible and instead of a plot we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing row row row your boat br br do i have something against william shatner i do not but when it comes to being a director he sucks this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen but it is the worst of the star trek series br br i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened br br overall this movie sucks br br 2 10
<START> this is a wonderful movie it's funny dark poignant thought provoking innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around i don't know that i've seen the like before the rapture or maybe one of todd black as night comedies or even the recent movie teeth come to mind but those are all bitter nasty little gems despite the darkness around the edges manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart br br the story is similar to john waters' low down dirty shame only this film differs in that it actually has a story and something to say as well beyond waters' juvenile sex isn't dirty snicker nudge nudge message a conservative repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly aren't so conservative anymore in fact they're finally actually happy probably the only people in their town or maybe the entire world who are to talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film simply put everyone should see it though of course only people who are already sold on what the movie's upbeat hopeful philosophy is ever would br br the acting is great just this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavy teresa willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when she's freed up both she and robertson dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a deviant sex practice into a touching believable and endearing moment as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch perfectly capturing the attitude angst and speech patterns of a girl her age vince as the brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting mari blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother franklin is wonderfully cold confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over the top br br technically the film looks fantastic all bright colors and wide open locales it looks like it may have been shot hi def if so the line has gotten very thin it looks very much like film there is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical which gets a bit preachy moreso i'd imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the film's politics but this film says a lot of things that need saying if only people wouldn't be afraid to listen and think the arguments that take place are smart and well thought out first and foremost refusing to either the religious or non religious parties br br the ending is on the ambiguous side which i found a bit of a disappointment somehow i think it would've worked better had the author as jay floyd is since he produced wrote and directed given a more workable denouement some sort of solution but then again there probably isn't one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another all the same it was a moving memorable final image that left me choked up a success meanwhile i'm awfully glad mr floyd got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible check it out
<START> the story is about a working girl ann sothern who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend paul kelly this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate so not wanting to just stay home she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man neil hamilton sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a love 'em and leave 'em sort of guy how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly br br this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures with a relatively small budget as well as second tier stars it's clearly a b movie despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwell as both had yet to become famous now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good in fact given the production values this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline that's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them the ending in particular is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing because of these factors the film earns a 7 of 10
<START> okay so this wasnt what i was expecting i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway but this film had b movie all over it but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was people and one man losing his sanity but those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it when he throws up the first of his little minions i knew this would be very very funny they all act like the gremlins in the eighty four hit gremlins that it made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget it was a b movie so if you like to laugh rent this one
<START> to me bollywood movies are not generally up to much though they are still quite desired and bollywood is a big file maker as they have their own fans br br the only motive that made me watch the movie was to see to what extent an american actress could change or affect the logic that indian movie were based on not only did not it change the movie story also this blending caused some ridiculous series of events br br i mean it is quite common to see heaps of illogical things through indian movies as they have their own world in their movies but once you see such incidents happen to an american it makes you laugh for god's sake can you believe a famous american actress is stuck in desperate situation and feel impotent can you imagine an american actress falls in loves with a dance instructor whose fiancÃ©e already fell in love with american's boy friend and they met each other at the same time there were lot of similar things to mention the less said the better br br perhaps i was wrong as i expected too much from indian movies
<START> the theme song often goes through my head after all these years i was never much of a tv watcher probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life but from the first episode of lawman i was hooked and it is the only tv show i've ever scheduled my week around br br intelligent believable well written and well acted and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw peter brown was no dog either o br br i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time i hope i can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch
<START> the movie starts good it has a thing going for it about 1 3 into the movie things go downhill carrey starts obsessing about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere so what thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls br br the acting by whoever is playing his son is bad from the get go as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it totally unbelievable i hope i never see this kid in another movie again br br its a waste of time watching this movie grab another boring piece of well the number is killing him give me a break i won't spoil the ending for you but let's just say it is equally disappointing br br 3 10
<START> beginning in 1942 the sherlock holmes character as portrayed by basil rathbone was set in the then 'modern' britain many holmes purists have praised the first two entries in the series produced by fox but dismissed the 12 features that followed i for one was never an avid reader and thus i appreciate these films as they are without any initial bias in fact the setting of world war ii for this entry places it as a period piece with the british propaganda evident throughout the film the execution of the modern holmes is handled with much more care than the previous entry sherlock holmes and the voice of terror and fares much better for two reasons first roy william neil is on hand to direct and would be for the rest of the series and second although holmes is pitted against the nazis the inclusion of professor moriarty makes this feel more like a battle of the intellect between two rivals lionel atwill's performance has been criticized by many as being far inferior to that of george zucco and henry daniel but i feel as if its more the script than the character interpretation especially after seeing that atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and enthusiastic in other horror roles basil rathbone on the other hand is exceptional in this entry he seems to be enjoying himself in the role of holmes but for that i blame the writing for example the introduction of holmes in the voice of terror tries to hard to immediately establish how superbly intelligent holmes is as soon as he is on screen whereas this film shows holmes' brilliant but also his shortcomings even in the climax holmes initially has the upper hand only to then have his blood slowly drained from his body now there are a few flaws in this film i thought i might point out first the opening aren't the germans fooled a little too easily maybe its just me but the book seller just waltzes into the bar says he's gonna get to not only answer his door after weeks of hiding but allow him to come in and then go for a walk with him what second certainly seems to put everyone around him in danger leaving the secret bomb parts with genius scientists leaving the note with his fiancÃ© like what was he thinking he was endangering them all i thought he was this superb scientist trying to save england and isn't the whole concept of 'use it on them before they use it on us' a little harsh obvious propaganda third just how in god's name was holmes supposed to fit in the bottom of that chest its really small in fact the entire execution of holmes finding moriarty in the ex con disguise really doesn't explain itself that well i have seen this film well over fifty times and there are still parts like this that i find are executed in a very confusing fashion fourth okay so holmes finds out the first three scientists are dead then immediately assumes that moriarty couldn't know the name of the fourth man because he wasn't dead yet well if holmes didn't know the name then how could he assume that the guy could very well have been face down in a lake lucky guess fifth again with the confusion when holmes is supposedly dying on moriarty's operating table how can he recover so quickly he sure was acting like he lost a few pints of blood but not enough to stop him from saving the day now despite these flaws this is a highly entertaining film the disguises are well done the mystery of the dancing men is well done especially the back to back scenes of holmes and moriarty each figuring out they were over analyzing them and dennis as inspector lestrade is always a plus and as a final note the interrogation scene still kinda bothers me i always thought that was one of the most well done sequences in the whole film overall this film holds a special place with me as it was the one that solidified my rathbone as holmes obsession a classic 7 10

<START> i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company br br attended the uk premiere last night zane and brook attended they probably knew i was gonna be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes br br but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongue in cheek was intended if so pure genius if not career genocide br br on the plus side zane always shines and brook can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema avec broken ribs they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be marooned
