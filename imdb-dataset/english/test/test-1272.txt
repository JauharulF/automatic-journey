<START> i liked this move when i was a kid but now that i'm older i can see how absurd the plot really is in case you didn't read the earlier reviews it's about a teenager and an air force colonel who steal two fully loaded f 16s to rescue said teenager's dad br br it does have some nice aerial stunts even if the dialog accompanying then is basically babel br br some unintentional humor in the edited for tv version when the hero's dad is being held by iran err i mean an unnamed country and his captors ask him for a confession relating to why he's being held don't worry about exactly why or what they want him to confuse to he says tell him he can take my confession and shove it down his throat however his lips and more his gesture make it clear what motion and part of the anatomy he was really thinking of
<START> take away all parts of the movie that were present day and stick to the flashbacks then you would have had a great story faith and wolf's story and their relationship was the best part diaz and eccleston were wonderful brewster was ponderous to sit through surprised to see blythe danner as mom she was great also look for patrick bergen as the father always like him sleeping with the enemy this is a very hippy save the world kind of film don't care for it much but i recommend seeing it for diaz's performance alone she has excellent range and it should be used more eccleston is as always compelling he's wonderful
<START> warning 1 tiny inconsequential spoiler you're right this was no bridges of madison county as soon as the lonely woman and richard gere checked into the big empty hotel it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen the question is how will it come about the answer is some stupid connect the dots story not worth sitting through in one supposed bonding experience they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans that was my spoiler and the next day they put them back lol it wasn't compelling at all i'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with richard gere lol it did have that advantage you walk away and go oh brother even i could have written something more believable than that i guess my life isn't quite as dull as i thought it was if i can scoff at a romance with richard gere lol and that friend inherited that totally contemporary probably computer generated mansion resting half in the ocean from her grandmother who built it after the civil war maybe her grandmother is oprah and this was way after the civil war and yes where was the email what alternative universe do these people live in i never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email and facebook and and ok maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first
<START> even though this was a well told story i found it too unpleasant the main subject is child abuse which is never fun to see a sordid topic add to that a lot of profanity by the abuser husband and a by a little kid no less and this movie turned me off as far as ever seeing it again br br also portrayed in here were punks picking on the two little boys another unpleasant viewing experience the realism of the story takes a swan dive when one of the boys flies away on a home made airplane give me a break br br the only positive enjoyable part of this movie is seeing the nice loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers played by elijah wood and joseph the latter became a familiar face in the next couple of years with big roles in jurassic park and the river wild wood of course didn't hit it big until a decade later but he made it very big in the lord of the rings trilogy those two kids and narration by an unbilled tom hanks are the only facets of this film i liked
<START> seymour cassel gives a great performance a tour de force his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke will always have a place in my heart the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams what he gets is lame surf hijinks guys cheating guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman next time my woman talks back i will pretend i'm the ball br br back to seymour cassel the end of the movie turns into a good drama since the first half of the film really had no point duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball the best he's played in over ten years the way the scene is shot is beautiful you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time 3 10 bad to fair the rest of the movie was lame
<START> i was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in new york it is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of september 11th this film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days the film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people i walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello i would recommend everyone see this documentary i would rate this movie with an a see it if you get a chance
<START> there are so many holes in the plot it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together i don't know much about george zucco but i've seen him in two movies obviously he has been cast as the loving father mad scientist vampire guy he looks so ordinary i'm surprised that he ended up in the genre this is the typical i will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army by transferring wolf blood or is it coyote to his hired hand he turns him into a werewolf glen strange who was one of karloff's as the frankenstein monster plays the kindly lovable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor at first the scientist is able to control when his name can be transformed but like the invisible man suddenly he starts morphing on his own and becomes a liability there is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice golly miss brooks she wants to leave but her father the doctor won't allow that he is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction the way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked it's not a very good movie the strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters lurk around the spanish moss once again the townsfolk are a bunch of morons who look like they escaped from a bad western one thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era there's also a pipe smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody listens to her
<START> i love this show i watched every episode last year i bought the dvds and i tune into to watch tonight and i see for some reason you have retooled this great show and you have taken what made it work and ruined it you took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends sam sully lizzy and piper i love the other characters as well but they are good in small dozes like derek darcy and even sully it is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in it is overdose while things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying i was so looking forward to the return of this show so please bring back the charm even if you could not fit piper into the show at least bring lizzy back but i loved those girls they brought the fun the show was about sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well that was the charm and that great dog as well br br i hope the network fox forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show i will give the show a couple more episodes before i give up but tonight's episodes were bad i made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and i felt like a fool because no one was laughing except 2 3 times i apologized to them and said i don't know what happened and about 10 minutes into the episode i realized they were not going to show piper or lizzy and this was no longer a must see tv comedy
<START> i thought this movie was fun i have never really watched old movies before and this one was a really great first date film it had warmth and heart and spirit was kind of cheesy but in today's film industry cheesy is cute i gave it a ten and i highly suggest renting buying or seeing the movie anyway you can gene kelly was very dreamy and a little bit sarcastic and you knew the character thought that he was gonna have it all the female lead was cast perfect because their two personalities had spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen the grandma in the movie was priceless the perfect addition to a great old movie i love the fact it was black and white and gene kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't help liking him see it
<START> i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad it's 4 3 aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened right br br if you want to see a good action boxing movie don't watch this one you'll end disappointed on this low budget movie like i did go and see ali its way better
<START> in one of the better movies of the year tom hanks stars as congressman charlie wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant given reasonably current events historical comedy drama surrounding the 1980s afghan soviet fiasco the soviets were attacking afghanistan killing hundreds of people why should anyone care people are dying right no the reason the united states got involved through charlie wilson was because the afghans in fear they would get blown to sh t started illegally coming into pakistan which in turn p ssed pakistani president mohammad ul haq off charlie wilson in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in texas joanne herring julia roberts and a amusing and robust american spy for the cia gust philip seymour hoffman to help supply afghans with high tech weapons to destroy soviet fight air craft that would try and attack their land br br although certainly not a serious oscar contender for best picture wilson's war' is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year academy award winner mike nichols provides solid directing as to be expected while emmy award winner aaron sport's night the west wing provides a remarkable screenplay that near flawlessly balances comedy and drama the acting is great for the most part as well tom hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 oscar nominated turn as a fedex worker stranded on a tropical island in 'cast away' hanks takes a slimy character like wilson and with his trademark charm turns him into a likable guy amy adams and ned beatty are reliable as always but the real stand out performance of the film is from philip seymour hoffman arguably the finest actor working in the film industry today hoffman takes a small supporting role and upstages everyone around him from his first scene where he's screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window hoffman sucks you in the only disappointing cast member is unsurprisingly overrated hollywood starlet julia roberts hamming her way through yet another movie roberts' overbearing and over the top portrayal of a rich texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is at most times flat out annoying at 97 minutes the movie is short and sweet and that isn't to say it doesn't drag at some points but when it does drag it's for a very brief amount of time br br in conclusion wilson's war' is not a perfect film by any means but it's certainly worth a look grade b
<START> can you say boring with a capital b it's slower than watching grass grow it's more boring than watching paint dry you'll sleep right through it we all did don't do it you'll regret it
<START> jesus franco is pretty hit or miss on his films i'd say this was a miss that is unless you're into total sleaze i will say that the man has an eye for a good shot even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean this is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible but the acting is the least of what this is about and what is it about well it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some most notable is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently amorous german shepherd and while what's going on is merely implied thankfully it is probably a scenario that i could have done without i'd rank this up there with tender flesh as one of the franco films i'd rather not have in my collection although the music is jazzy and fun 4 out of 10 yecch
<START> this music is totally out of touch with the film showing up now and then as wagnerian bombast and lone ranger hurry up otherwise nonexistent the acting outside of the two principals is nonexistent it would have been an excellent student film the russian soldiers are just models trying to act the constant interruptions with wow explosive camera angles and clips of pieces of people were quite irritating but that's just a personal feeling the story line isn't worse than others actually not worse than most completely ignoring logic and reason and reality at least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit the three top level bad guys were campy
<START> this film is too good for words its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life you just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has defiantly felt the way that jip and his friends do through the film it was my life at one point and i would rely on coming home to watch human traffic ever night before i could even think of going to bed i think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style of course this film wouldn't be for old people more around the age of 16 to 22 i guess there is defiantly nothing wrong with this film and it will have you in stitches all the way through it doesn't have a particular story line to it the general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in london and what they get up to the places they go the people they meet the drugs they take and the experiences they have you have to get this movie on dvd never mind just watching it you have to have it
