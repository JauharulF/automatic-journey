<START> things that are only just now news were taken as a given in this shocking documentary i fear that as the investigation proceeds the producers of this film will be vindicated in spades br br the producers show us the davidians the government agents the investigators with all their faults and all their humanity nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself pieces of evidence congressional testimony 911 tapes news footage expert commentary interviews photos and home videos are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale br br do not wait see this film and tell your friends
<START> first let's call this movie what it is br br 1 it's a feel good movie with a message br br 2 the acting is just okay dialog slightly better production value pretty good br br 3 rugby scenes just barely passable br br but here's the trick this isn't something hollywood contrived and it isn't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport it is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people in real circumstances and a real storyline sure they could have done a better job actually the sport but my vote it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do br br and i can't think of many football baseball hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either c'mon bull durham br br i'm not a rugby player i was a wrestler but i graduated from highland attended '86 '90 and occasionally trained with the rugby guys my brother in law david however was one of the original founding members of the highland rugby club in 1976 his younger brother billy played the next year as i recall if you're interested there's a highland rugby site at net that addresses the history of the team br br by the time i was there the club had been in existence for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence it's a fact that they focused on broad training topics devotion honor discipline effort not tactics i thought the rugby guys i knew were a little 'off' in the head but i think i might have just been a little jealous they were hard core dedicated to the belief system that promoted br br with regard to the cultural mixing issues that have been brought up it might be interesting to note that while i was there in the 80's one of the larger schools in the city was shut down south high school and its students distributed among the other 3 primary slc schools to be honest highland pre 80's was pretty whitebread i've got a picture of the team from i think 1977 that shows an all white club south high on the other hand was a much more racially integrated school before it closed i had a pair of friends from south who joined the team one one samoan and as i recall there were a bunch of island nation players that joined up '88 '90 i don't think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting or other cultural traditions if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys it's that they walked the walk br br and as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool age teams in the world yeah it's true that us rugby on average when taken as a whole does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere there are exceptions but hey it's a simple fact that rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the us that arise in other countries br br with that said judge highland on its merits br br the only team to qualify for the usa rugby national championships every year of that 25 yr history br br a win record of wins 9 losses read that again coach in any us sport in history br br regular international tours br br some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams br br are they the world best maybe some years probably not most but they're pretty good on a consistent basis and it's disrespectful to the game to blow them off when highland rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the us
<START> while i agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made i am proud to say i own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras mostly in the dance club scenes but a few others as well this movie had potential with bolo and the director of enter the dragon signed on but as someone who was on set most every day i can tell you that robert clouse was an old and confused individual at least during the making of this movie it was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday i would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at morning calm studios i can't say that it would have been for sure but it would be nice to think so i was actually surprised that it was ever released and that someone like bolo would attach his name to it without a fight oh well also look at the extras for pro wrestler scott levy aka raven he was a wrestler in portland at the time nice guy very smart
<START> this is the best movie i have ever seen and i love it very much is is so sad and loving i could watch this movie over and over again when i first seen it on disney channel i was like i would love to see this movie again i would love to watch this movie everyday and i recommend it to anyone this is really a good movie to anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it they better go and see it because it is really good i love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from then on i was just all into this movie if i could watch two movies everyday it would be this one and beloved those are my two favorite movies i really love them
<START> can to some people look a bit long but it's one of rare real adventure film it could be compare to with a bit of sleepy you must see it
<START> okay this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life despite the fact that it's lower budget it's a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty things are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room
<START> this little two person movie is actually much bigger than it looks it has so many layers i've watched it over and over and always pick up on something new i am amazed at the depth of the acting and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star
<START> admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero bond and villain were seriously miscast is too big and innocent looking to play bond he looks and acts more like the good natured but dim witted sidekick in a police action movie the director and writer try to establish his credibility but his saying of lines like royal north of the just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue savalas doesn't do a bad job but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor this movie is too long 140 mins for a bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until bond's mountain escape where it begins to pick up this film tries very hard but falls short many bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one
<START> i rented this movie under the impression that it was scarecrow 3 dark harvest thinking it was a continuation in the scarecrow slayer series another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies i wasn't disappointed though it was just as awful if not worse than what i expected i was laughing throughout the entire movie every piece of bad acting poorly shot and cut footage and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting br br the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and crew's six months of filming br br favorite line the sins of my forefathers they've down to this very moment of time
<START> well i remember when the studio sacked schrader and hired harlin to do reshoots to this film they were quite right to do so br br dominion prequel to the exorcist is simply a bad movie it's boring really it is br br it would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned harlin's version and praised even if no one had ever seen it would have been right br br but they weren't br br to put it in a nutshell schrader has no idea what a horror film should be and it shows in a big way br br droll boring unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast br br save your cash and your nerves don't see it
<START> if you like who dun its you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has done br br it's not mickey spillane for sure there are scenes designed to disturb anyone br br many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12 year old boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to tempt the local priest br br young boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you don't jump on the first guy it's way too early and he is too obvious br br anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had
<START> the story takes place in rural germany on the eve of the second world war a unique setting with a couple of british agents being held by the germans in a farm house since they aren't technically at war yet it seems as if both sides must have realized what was coming both agents bruce lester and ray milland escape into the countryside and split up milland happens upon gypsy woman marlene dietrich one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner their encounter is an amazing and captivating scene not so much for milland but for dietrich who takes sexy to a whole new plane milland disguises himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the germans but he remains committed to his mission to do with locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but who also isn't a committed nazi the hollywood take on gypsy life and customs is predictably portrayed but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets for extermination by the nazis adds a certain tension the film the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent search to get the formula and a colorful though not too convincing love story between milland and dietrich however they're both very good it's the fault of the film that didn't give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes nonetheless there are some tense and interesting points here and there the surprise meetings with german soldiers and gestapo agents where dietrich does a great palm reading and milland nearly as good faking one and a dinner party of germans of various stripes at which the announcement comes over the radio that germany had been attacked by poland and everyone stands and does a stiff arm salute mitchell may have missed some opportunities here and there but he fully took advantage of others
<START> forget everything that you have ever read about the brothers' straight to video release snakes on a train especially if it was a negative review this movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off snakes on a plane frankly i am surprised that more people aren't about this low budget asylum release instead most reviews that i've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy such as the acting was amateurish the action didn't numerically live up to the advertising and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time of course it doesn't help that the title is a tip off to the obvious rip off nature of this film actually i felt that snakes on a train surpassed snakes on a plane for a number of reasons br br first the producers used real genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super giant snake that consumed an entire like train how many movies have a snake gobble a train as a result snakes on a train ranks as the first movie to scale that height br br second this low budget movie employs some grisly gross out effects the woman who coughs up baby snakes real ones was fantastic the special effects of her getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing also you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake she was as cute as she could be no more than 10 years old or thereabouts and she died screaming all the way as nasty giant mister snake head swallows her not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten this is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won't find in 99 of all theatrical hollywood releases of course she wasn't eaten by a real snake but it's the subversive thought that counts br br third it is one of those cursed upon movies where alma julia ruiz of that guy the chief female character no heroine has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man that they recommended as a result she is filled with snakes coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake imagine medusa the mythical characters that had snakes for hair only with the snakes in her belly her psycho shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to l a on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines prepare yourself for lots of slime blood and gore br br fourth the train had only about twenty or so passengers not hundreds nevertheless it looked like the brothers filmed this above average horror flick on board a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks br br fifth the snakes slither around for the first hour quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody in other words it's suspense suspense suspense before people start dying from snake bites br br up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it snakes on a train is warped wonderful and way out it doesn't have the attention deficit editing of a big league hollywood movie it's a fantasy about an unfortunate hispanic women victimized because of her feminist at odds with society attitude br br altogether you've got gory fantasy type stuff suspenseful snakes around the train and am over the top gigantic snake at the end incidentally they get on board the train because a bunch of other mexicans have bribed a train employee and the mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free br br i think it's better than snakes on a plane if you want a tough little independently produced horror movie
<START> below average action melodrama in which the lovely ms grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father rudy challenger and his partner austin stoker of the original assault on precinct 13 whose loan business is being threatened br br i'll be frank i agree with the few other user comments for this movie sheba baby has a less than satisfying script direction that isn't particularly distinguished action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best and one of ms grier's more nondescript supporting casts although there's an important supporting role for martin also a familiar name in i get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity br br it sure was cool seeing stoker again although ms grier doesn't have as good a role or dialog as she has had in other films although she is doing what she does best and that's playing a sassy sexy sister on a mission of vengeance br br non stop soul funk soundtrack is enjoyable at the very least br br mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the pam grier film repertoire br br 4 10
<START> i'll be honest the pimped out purple plane with snoop dogg at the helm is an amusing visual gag it would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial or maybe a 3 minute music video but the producers have committed the age old concept comedy sin of stretching 30 seconds of material into an hour and a half of film and the results are predictably lame the remainder of the 89 minutes are filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes offensive and worst of all painfully unfunny the threadbare plot screams under the weight of its contrivances best to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned
