<START> and that's saying something no matter how bad a movie gets i'm normally able to sit through it so i can judge the full movie through this one i made it about 20 minutes br br maybe it was the dvd or maybe it was my laptop but i could not hear the dialogue even with the volume turned all the way up sound effects were fine so with the volume turned up to hear the dialogue i was blowing out my eardrums with the effects as much as i wanted to see this thing through i wasn't going to sacrifice my hearing for it br br from what little i could tell about the plot the movie was one big flashback by the main character's daughter it seems the mother a military pilot had to flee her ship because the one person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemy and now he is pursuing her across a desert planet br br the only thing i liked about the movie was the look of the main character there was something i liked about her hairstyle br br oh well looks like this one is going into the dumpster
<START> here is a much lesser known 50's sci fi with a little different twist an atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the father's atomic secrets br br this is a tightly knit atomic sci fi thriller with great production values and above average acting even from the kid the atomic city actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a tv show br br the atomic city was also actually nominated for an academy award for best screenplay how many other 50's sci fi can tout an academy award nomination br br great pacing tight direction and some superb location filming in the 'real' atomic city of los new mexico make this one worth hunting down the collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the atomic man br br recommended
<START> william shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy tragedy or history some of his most memorable and most often read creations provide us with wistful humor gentle poetry and hilarious slapstick some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity regardless he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness contributing greatly to our young language so in what category lies the merchant of venice i was very surprised to find it is one of shakespeare's comedies i had never before read it nor seen it but after watching this most recent film version i have decided it is neither and it is both this is one of many questions the viewer must try to answer when coming to terms with what is clearly a perplexing and deeply troubling moral tragedy br br the players are introduced quickly and simply one of them firstly is venice itself director michael radford filmed the venetian scenes in the actual city creating an impressively vibrant bustling backdrop to the play's proceedings to this scenery enters the youthful joseph fiennes returning to venice to see a dear old friend antonio jeremy irons it seems the poor has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential suitors a lottery of sorts waiting at the fair lady's island estate are three small trunks br br only one of which contains images of the princess he who can guess the right one using only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written upon them will be bestowed the father's huge fortune for life oh and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage i forgot to mention here the light comedy of shakespeare takes over the movie this farcical plot element drives the story and also fills up much of the film's screen time as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island humorously vying for and failing to earn this very wealthy hand in marriage but before any of this occurs very much lacking in finances antonio to loan him three thousand to pay for the lengthy journey he must take to have his shot at the prize br br antonio himself nearly penniless must reluctantly embrace humility by seeking the financial aid of shylock al pacino one of countless jewish who keep the sagging economy afloat yet are scorned and persecuted to no end by the city's christian majority thus they dwell in society's underbelly and it is here the two borrowers must go shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where antonio insulted and spat on him in the city market and he proudly rebukes this man who frankly has a lot of nerve now coming to ask for help but help him shylock does he even erases any kind of interest on the loan most likely feeling he has no reason to be concerned if antonio will be able to repay him within three months still one contractual demand is a pound of antonio's flesh should he on their agreement this is an unsettling request to be sure for antonio and as well as for us but it appears that despite his justifiable pride shylock does not really anticipate seeing such a gruesome act occurring br br so here the dramatic groundwork has been laid and while the film goes off to explore its gentler side with its love lottery and mistaken identities there still looms the gloomy prospect of the loan itself in the end what will become of this ominous agreement meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of shylock al pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here and he does so with convincing grit and passion there are times when he is given room for the theatrics we have come to expect from such a colorful actor but his most impressive scenes are the ones where he internalizes this energy showing a conflicted personality honest sincere and proud yet brooding vengeful and entirely remorseless this is one of pacino's most heartfelt performances to date and while the rest of the cast play their roles and convincingly it is pacino who really owns the film especially toward the end when shakespeare upends this seeming romantic comedy with a wallop of a third act br br i shall not reveal much here all i can say is that it involves the initial loan a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later and does it ever by the end shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas for his audience seemingly questions of faith morality law and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes and while by curtain's close the playwright's position may seem clear to some we are left completely at odds there are winners and losers in this one but have the winners earned their spoils with good reason or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well has virtue been rewarded or simply has justice in fact this time been just by the play's finish some fates are painfully clear and unequivocally sealed but the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved and for some the verdict is still out for the play as well comedy or tragedy the author has cunningly veiled the intense courtroom finale with an ending of light mirth and pat romantic resolutions is he saying that all is well that ends well or is this his final ironic condemnation the play's humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash and while it is also what unfortunately keeps the merchant of venice from achieving the greatness of so many of shakespeare's other works it is still engaging amusing and thought provoking beyond measure
<START> inappropriate the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa whale rider gets a pg 13 but this movie gets a pg please parents don't be fooled taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary br br but all that aside the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable or hateable in this case alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this the kids are conditioned actors and it shows especially with dakota fanning fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen br br did i mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie mike myers is absolutely deplorable i didn't like him as the voice of shrek and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers br br in the end the cat should not have come he should have stayed away but he came even if just for a day he ruined 82 minutes of my life 82 minutes of personal anger and strife br br the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever
<START> this movie was released originally as a soft x apparently with the explicit sex deleted later the producers relented smelled money and re released it with the excised scenes restored apparently only about 3 minutes i guess since kristine was of age it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt i guess its all in the timing witness pam anderson's career but ronald reagan was in charge during debacle we had not heard about nancy reagan's affairs bill clinton and monica lewinski were in full swing during pam's coming out br br the sex is just icing on the cake both version satisfy this naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time
<START> committed doom and peter goes across the pond to take on the american justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with clichÃ© freaks hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements talk about a revolution br br in punishment park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across punishment park death valley and freedom of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed br br punishment park has elements of kafka in setting as well as theme trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of such as members of silent majority for a peaceful america who snarl back neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with america the other saying what's right with no one offering solutions for change meanwhile the punishment park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds it kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now br br peter has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century scotland that still resonates war game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all punishment park has its value as well but for other than intended reason vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times vietnam kent state the chicago 7 such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth but 35 years later the fever has subsided and punishment park with it's unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride
<START> a very good film focusing on a very important issue fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable if more families saw this film perhaps more children would not end up like adam jimmie performs in one of his best roles ever this is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs this is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the united states today there are children struggling with this world wide the really important point here is that it all could have been prevented more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously it is well done with important messages handled in a graceful way
<START> a very watchable film and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times br br the whole thing looks superb from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly br br jonny lee miller plays maclean extremely well though the part does not exactly stretch him and robert carlyle seems a little wasted on miller's highwayman colleague br br the real star of the show was undoubtedly ken who plays mr chance a kind of chief of police with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast br br a great film and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of peter greenaway's films will love the look of this although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up br br well worth a viewing
<START> now i understand that this took two months to shoot really i'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week this movie sucked so bad i couldn't even pay close attention just more proof that boob bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing acting and direction now i understand it was a no budget endeavor but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand oh there are a few decent looking females showing the goods still there aren't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry one of the longest 80 minutes of my life i it out though with the help of my old friend jim beam do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job lastly the individual moron who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and loved it just more proof that siblings shouldn't pro create ow burn captain j
<START> a rather lame teen slasher from brisbane while the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden the problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devil may care it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really in fact i only started enjoying the film when i started wishing for their death one of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police i realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't avoid
<START> the slasher sub genre has been pretty much exhausted in fact even by 1979 just one year after the supposed 'first slasher' halloween which was released seven years after bay of blood was released the sub genre wasn't far from being exhausted but tourist trap represents one of the more original outings the film follows the same basic formula as most slashers i e madman murders a load of kids but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning as opposed to an unseen assailant or a man in a mask and we actually get some insight into his character the fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities including being able to control the wax dummies that fill his house adds to the originality we kick off with a great opening sequence which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror the scene is amazingly creepy as the wax dummies taunt him and things fly from the shelves and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come namely a very creepy horror film br br the acting credibility is as non existent as you would expect from a seventies slasher but to be honest it's not all that bad the girls look hot the boys don't really matter and chuck connors is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho he's not exactly anthony perkins but still good enough it's not the acting that's the star of the show however and as you might expect the creepy atmosphere takes that prize wax models as proved by the likes of house of wax vincent price version are very creepy and the film makes best use of that fact there are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there but wax statues are definitely one of those things the killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere but the film makes best use of this fact even by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie on the whole this is a very good film while tourist trap might not be absolutely essential viewing it's well worth seeing and i can recommend it
<START> although i watched this film by myself thankfully i still felt embarrassed while watching it i was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover and the bloody gritty camera stills on the back which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary these actors are laughable throughout the entire film not convincing at all the story involves an italian australian gang just fighting other gangs and then running fighting repeat supposedly they train extremely hard which makes them way better than other gangs for some reason i don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size i could be wrong no i'm not wrong this movie is not enjoyable on any level the jail montage looked like it was a summer camp just instead of kids it was a sausage fest of horrible actors just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard this movie is not worth your time save your money or throw it in the garbage just don't waste it on this movie
<START> things i like steve as gus nails the part copies robert mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to gus fans some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well karl urban looks grim and tough but can crack a joke and smile too which t l jones did in original series the gear the guns the clothing all accurate or very close to period accurate i'll never forgive costner and duvall for having a in their in open range the they are actually riding rather than hiding a modern saddle under a navajo blanket and they aren't painted as politically correct peace loving but as a proud warrior people there are some dumb scenes but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows
<START> i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasn't paying proper attention but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film from director lionel jefferies who played grandpa potts in chitty chitty bang bang basically it starts with a happy upper middle class family living in victorian london one night the father is visited by two strangers and he leaves with them and does not return they move to a cottage in the country and here the children bobbie jenny agutter who i first saw in child's play 2 phyllis sally thomsett and peter gary warren keep their spirits up with their fascination for the nearby railroad everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes their kindness makes them friends including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father also starring dinah sheridan as mother mrs waterbury bernard cribbins as albert perks william mervyn as old gentleman peter as doctor forrest ann lancaster as ruth and gordon whiting as russian it was number 29 on the 100 greatest family films and it was number 24 on the 50 greatest british films very good
<START> i have to admit thanks to this movie i'm now afraid of mannequins hahaha br br but yes first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty swell most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles the script also seems to be pretty good too sure some cheesy stuff in there but also some decently written character and some damn scary scenes i still get shivers thinking about that one scene with the dude and the mannequins brrr br br yeah i'll say you should check this movie out it's pretty good and very entertaining a good watch 8 10
