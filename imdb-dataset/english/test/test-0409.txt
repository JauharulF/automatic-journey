<START> witchery is a decent little euro trash horror yarn david hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly he's one of the better actors linda blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays wife she is hilariously bad the plot of this film is ridiculous too it's got some holes which you can't help but notice but it remains entertaining throughout br br the gore in witchery is freaking outstanding i loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast and the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the devil was pretty damned disturbing i'd say this one is a must for gorehounds br br if you're looking for an overproduced well acted flick look elsewhere but if you like old school style italian sleaze and over the top gore witchery belongs on your shelf br br i'm surprised by the low rating on here what were you people expecting the exorcist 7 out of 10 kids
<START> the thirty years that have passed since the making of this movie have made the suspense wither somewhat and will not keep the public as attentive as i am sure it did in 1979 it is still entertaining enough though and regains some of it's power when one finds out its sad relevance today check out the story of davis nuclear plant with the top of the line actors and steady pace one can learn to overlook the dated '70s environment and see it for the political critique that it is i doubt however it will survive the test of time it might not be entirely forgotten thanks to its cast but otherwise the dialog setting and score will make a remake of this movie unavoidable as the oil situation now is comparable to the situation in the 70's and alternative sources of energy are again becoming a hotter topic we can only hope the current generation gets blockbuster warnings about the risks of nuclear power like this
<START> another day this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it i thoroughly enjoy watching and i was quite interesting in seeing how well julian mcmahon and appeared together following the roles they played in charmed i can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film even the directing but the plot what happened i am at a loss for words because i am still confused i have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot i also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot madness i would still watch it over and over again
<START> i personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so i had a good feeling about watching this don't look in the basement even though its reputation is doubtful well turned out i was right this is great trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters you have to of course look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but if you manage to do that and if you're a fan of this type of horror that's an essential quality you'll be rewarded with an outrageous video nasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements the young and cute nurse charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she's supposed to start her new job she finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor in charge masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival the life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked after a whole series of bizarre events charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides the opening 10 minutes pre credits are great and so is the completely deranged climax everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun the patients are textbook lunatics but i love them nevertheless some of my favorites include the former judge who still talks exclusively in legal terms the suspicious army sargeant and the mad raving old lady don't look in the basement is great low brained fun especially recommended to fans of 70's trash cinema sick puppies and other types of scum the lunatics have taken over the asylum yeah
<START> it's a kinder gentler cyborg movie with a love story awww it's not as bad as it sounds the action when it is there is decent and jack palance elias koteas and angelina jolie are always dependable it's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible jean claude van damme film or is that the capper to the masters of the universe trilogy i'm still confused about that either way there was really no need for this movie what was there a need for angelina jolie she may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid coitus but what a way to go and even though this is her first movie she still has the presence that made her an award winner
<START> being a seasoned fan of italian thrillers and directors dario argento mario bava sergio martino and aldo i thought of lucio fulci as an overrated hack i had seen the beyond which i think is totally overrated i found the new york ripper to be simply appalling and i didn't particularly like the house by the cemetery these three movies left me to conclude that fulci is the least interesting of these italian filmmakers but my stubbornness prevailed and i had to check out more of his films city of the living dead was a film i found very interesting but don't torture a duckling is very nearly a masterpiece br br set in a small town in the italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered the authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes especially after their prime suspect has been cleared an eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl who seduces young boys investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it br br brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast not always the case with 70's italian thrillers make don't torture a duckling a crackling good thriller the plot is well constructed not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk fulci's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled when thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo new york ripper it's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point so far i haven't seen any fulci film made as professionally as this one br br while not a traditional giallo film duckling has many of the genre's trademarks fulci displays complete control over the format only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore moment but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics the extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch br br so far don't torture a duckling is fulci's best film by far in my opinion edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot
<START> if there's one good suspenseful film this is one of them james stewart puts on a dazzling performance as american dr ben mckenna who with his wife and son are in africa on tour they stumble on a murder scene and dr mckenna's son is kidnapped hours later br br before you can say fasten your seat belts dr mckenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it however other people know he can be dangerous dangerous to them that is and try to dispose of him br br eventually hank the son is found alive and well br br if you like suspenseful movies this is the one to watch br br my score 8 10
<START> everybody i talked to said that this movie would be good and really weird so i figured that i would rent it half way through the movie i was thinking to myself what the heck was going on and what is the point to this movie this movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie didn't even bother me i mean what are they going to come up with next volcano 2 the return of the lava i mean come on this movie is so stupid the characters are so poorly developed and eve robert englund makes the movie worse i mean he might as well be transformed into freddy and spook people i was actually rooting for the bad guy to win that's how bad it was i mean look the father is a cop he didn't seem to care real much about the fact that his daughter is going through one of the most moments in her life i mean if my daughter was treated like that i would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind jail also it seems kind of obvious that dee character would turn bad again this is one of the worst films of all time right there with volcano and 8mm do not waist your time you will not enjoy it br br grade if there were a no grade on this site i would pick that thats how bad this movie is
<START> first the easy part this movie is pretentious crapola br br it put me in mind of magnolia and then i thought wow somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than magnolia br br i know nothing about the polish brothers but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling the trite plot elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough but the dialogue is just pathetic br br detailed comments would just be a laundry list of failure the parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not the parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music the emotional parts are simplistic br br the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters except for a little cornball dignity in the priest br br i still can't believe the respect some people have given this picture
<START> s shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by
<START> i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a 'b grade video night' at a friends place despite the warnings i was still surprised at just how bad this film was it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future one in which hawk a mad max type of character heads off to rescue a damsel in distress in reality the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life watch the end credits and the people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh the movie is frequently lacking direction and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever what's even worse though is the editing of this film the film repeats scenes often 10 to 20 seconds long up to 4 or 5 times in a row i think that this was an attempt to emulate things like jean claude van damme fight sequences but if it is it fails utterly the film would probably be about 1 3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times yes that's all that happens in that repeated scene i give this movie my 'worst film i've ever seen' award i doubt that it will be topped any time soon
<START> clifton webb as mr is one of the all time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence now diminished in the world i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie although i have requested it time and again br br this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty respect dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis there is so much low self esteem talked about in present daily lives but this movie among many many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the present day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences it certainly appealed to us 'baby generation of yesterday old lessons are universal and timeless
<START> first i have to say that i have read everything about this subject and i know it inside out and i was excited about finally seeing it too but you have to read only the book this mini series is based on to realize that it's not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago it's loosely based on the facts the rest is taken from the scriptwriter's imagination and unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary br br where do i begin vita and violet didn't use the names and until their affair started and during it violet also called vita and julian it was violet who chased vita with a dagger when they were teenagers the scene when their affair started violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn't kiss vita first i could go on and on these examples were all included when the series was only just started besides all these alterations from the facts the characterizations are also all wrong at times vita behaves like a mad woman especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper violet's engagement announcement is just ridiculous vita kept her of emotion inside it was violet who was temperamental and let her feelings good or bad show all vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted that's all being a gentle nature harold avoided confrontations in real life but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing harold and vita always discussed their intimate things in letters not verbally and violet i know that this series purposely concentrated on vita and harold but that doesn't mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines here she is totally one dimensional character and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow actually she was intelligent gifted quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves i have always thought her much more interesting person than vita in this series her unhappiness loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored viewer has also little clue of her background and family what kind of relation and marriage with denys she had or how hard she battled over vita vita was the only love of her life her raison d'etre and if harold suffered during affair so did violet after it her life was in ruins and it took time that she could pull herself back together again statue could have acted the role of denys that much depth his character has lady sackville west is just a badly drawn caricature an annoying with exaggerating french accent br br the series ends to the totally badly written scene in and that was the end of this affair according to scriptwriter no it continued a whole year after that and it's ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here but what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start i have to give some credit to actors they tried to make best of those roles given to them though janet mcteer as vita is the only one who really shines through one can't complain the settings either all complaints go to director and most of all scriptwriter instead of insightful character studies there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation many of the scenes are too long some are pointless and don't bring anything to the story line on the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether especially there should have been more information about vita's and violet's youth and how their friendship developed this is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation maybe someday someone will do it at the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or violet's letters to vita which are brilliant stuff
<START> one reviewer says of those who might not like this film that it will only be appreciated by film goers who weary of film as diversion this i feel is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring br br i have not become weary or disillusioned with film or with film makers but found this tedious and self indulgent but then it's true i'm not too big into deep meaningfulness i feel that it may have great meaning for those in the know you know br br it is very slow and it spends a long time in trying to make its individual points using imagery indeed to do so but in such days as these it seems possible that a film like this might be the kind of thing that you'd come across in one of those dark and daunting in modern art galleries rather than on the screen of a popular cinema setting
<START> so this ugly guy with long nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend there was suppose to be something scary in it but i didn't see anything scary at all there is some mention of a demon from the sea but that doesn't go anywhere at all i wish it did because then it would've taken the tension away from the jealous love triangle the title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie but it is so far from it that i couldn't believe it i waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did it did not live up to the title like it should have so boo hoo hoo the cover had a cool picture but i shouldn't judge a cheesy movie by its cover
