<START> i have been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 70's early 80's when this movie came out it was a must to see it and after seeing it i went right over and bought it the movie is great i love the animated action it brings and the music is great yes i bought the soundtrack on cd a recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy
<START> two young friends grow up together in afghanistan the events of their lives drive them apart and one of them has now been living in the usa for a good number of years as he receives a phone call it is clear that he has to return for there is trouble in the air br br this is a film about life lasting friendships mistakes and making up again but also a film about darkness pain and endurance from the pleasurable young days of growing up and playing games to the falling apart back to the playing of games this is a slow film but not too slow br br it plays on emotions and that is quite right for a drama but it does so a bit too much for my liking this makes it too much of a tearjerker loosing it a bit of the quality it carries it is still good but not fantastic br br 7 out of 10 kites ran
<START> by strange coincidence i've started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop br br unfortunately oss 117 again left me disappointed i don't know maybe it's just problem with translations but since diner de cons i haven't seen any french comedy that i would call really good even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss 117 high notes br br for me this movie didn't really work in some parts is as funny as real bond movies in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny
<START> without question film is a powerful medium more so now than ever before due to the accessibility of dvd video which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people use of this medium therefore attaches an innate responsibility to the artist inasmuch as film can be educational as well as entertaining which dictates that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensibility a film like spielberg's schindler's list ' for example is important in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten and as history tends to repeat itself spielberg's film can be viewed as a valuable tool in preventing a of that tragedy in that same vein this film focus ' directed by neal is important in it illuminates the problematic reality of anti semitism which for years beyond number has affected millions of people is still unimaginably prevalent today and like any manifestation of bigotry will perpetuate itself if left unchecked or ignored born of a xenophobic strain it's a disease infecting society which could be terminal and with it's penetrating insights into the condition this film is an effective vaccine that just may at the very least help stem the proliferation of it and hopefully may act as a step toward eradicating it altogether br br lawrence newman william h macy served his country in the great war and has since lived a quiet conventional life in new york he's had the same job as a personnel director for some twenty years and owns the house located in an average middle class neighborhood in which he lives with his mother kay hawtrey lawrence is the kind of guy who gets by just fine by minding his own business and refusing to involve himself with matters that are not he feels his concern br br all of that is about to change however as with the advent of world war 2 lawrence along with the owner of the corner market mr david paymer inexplicably finds himself a target of the neighborhood who have aligned themselves with the union crusaders ' a national organization currently taken to channeling their fears and hatred upon jews or anyone who even looks' like a jew and suddenly lawrence finds that he can no longer just stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played because now he is the game whether he wants to be or not br br working from an intelligent well written screenplay by which he adapted from arthur miller's novel presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry upon those against whom it is leveled and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a hypothetical situation but a depiction of reality it becomes all the more disquieting even unnerving and what makes the film so effective is obvious grasp of his subject and his studied presentation which is thought provoking in it's subtlety in the opening scene establishes lawrence's character ' and very soon afterward reaffirms it in another scene which affords the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how lawrence's mind actually works the thought processes that direct his life with that in place then is able to take his audience along with lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold by so doing he effectively illustrates how the problem evolves rather than merely stating the problem and addressing it head on which heightens the viewers emotional involvement and ultimately enhances the impact of the film br br makes an important statement with this film which is not only an indictment of bigotry but carries a cautionary message about apathy as well and to his credit he never hits you over the head with it or engages in subjective finger pointing to make his case instead he proceeds carefully taking great pains to be as objective as possible with all that he is submitting for your consideration his approach is that of a cinematic diplomat and it's an approach that serves and his film quite well br br as lawrence william h macy one of the best character actors in the business gives an amazing performance establishing the credibility and believability of his character with a sensitive honest and introspective portrayal he never attempts to circumvent the personal flaws of lawrence's nature but uses them instead to create a character that is decidedly three dimensional which not only makes him convincing but serves to reaffirm the integrity of the portrayal what makes it so compelling is macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own conscience which successfully enables the viewer to share in the experience of his personal epiphany in the final analysis it's the strength of macy's performance more than anything else that makes this film so significantly distinct br br another of the film's strengths is the performance turned in by laura dern as gertrude hart a portrayal that effectively complements macy's work as well as that of dern lends tremendous substance to her character capturing her physically as well as emotionally and her colorful zeal crates a striking contrast to lawrence's reserve that works extremely well for her character as well as the film itself br br and just as sean combs recently in monster's ball' made a good case against dismissing out of hand the acting endeavors of an established rock star ' meat loaf gives a powerful performance here as fred lawrence's next door neighbor it demonstrates too that a true artist will produce regardless of the kind of canvas he's given to work with br br the supporting cast includes michael carlson kenneth welsh father crighton joseph ziegler gargan and arlene meadows mrs dewitt the kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft focus ' offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove to be enlightening as well to those unaware that such conditions have existed and still do even in this the land of the free 10 10 br br br br
<START> read the book forget the movie
<START> the idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie especially because it's meant to be funny and i guess heart warming in some weird way the problem is the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross it was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them there was just no payoff also the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have been caught almost immediately especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end and as far as being gross goes i just didn't need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road plus believe it or not there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep br br all in all i really hated this movie and it's a shame as i almost always love japanese films just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one
<START> i think i can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didn't act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isn't a robot either br br the whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set i can't even use words to describe the acting br br this couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of star crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst sci fi movies of the 80's and i would be so bold as to say of all time
<START> the bbc surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with tipping the velvet in the past they've been 'daring' with dennis potter's works but this mini series as it was screened in the uk is superb andrew davies work is top notch i've not read the sarah water's novel but i can imagine he's done it real justice i comment on the most men have watched it for that proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised the fact is it the lesbian side of society in the 1800s a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys well it was lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors br br you can also look at tipping the velvet as a 'love story' it actually is as well as 'self that many gay bi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time br br if you've not seen it yet either repeated on tv or on dvd get it you'll be in for a treat and even the production and filming of it is perfect just try to hide your in parts like i said is the order of the day and beware a or two br br enjoy
<START> cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term video nasties this was a notorious british list containing all the films that could bring to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences dramatization for gore buffs this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies faces of death cannibal holocaust driller killer as well as outrageous and ultra sick horror films the burning nightmare city the toolbox murders keeping this in mind it's quite unusual to see night of the bloody apes listed among the other nasties it sure is the blood and violence are so poorly presented i can't imagine anyone would be offended by it and the silly plot about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla's heart into the chest of his dying son isn't exactly what you would call disturbingly real neither all that remains is a fairly amusing pulp horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze the man ape make up effects are laughable and there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere enjoyable only if you're in the right mood in other words the few sequences showing detailed matches of lady wrestling which one of the lead actresses does for a living are very cool
<START> alright the first time i seen talk radio was in a video store for only 2 00 on vhs believe it or not and i looked at it and i thought it might be about howard stern because i just looked at it for about thirty seconds then just didn't see it again then i went to another store about a month later and i found talk radio on dvd for only 5 00 so i see it was directed by oliver stone and i picked it up so after the film was over i was speechless i have never seen such a film like this here's the main plot then i'll tell ya what i thought of it br br it is about a dallas talk radio host barry a jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he and is taking everything seriously now a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the u s so barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like chet a neo kent a rock n roll drugged kid john rapist and others now some of the callers sound like the same actor actresses but still i think it fits okay br br now what i love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station the dark music in the background fits very nicely too it has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio which i think they did good on br br but the great thing about the film is ending i was surprised by it and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful it also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like dallas one of oliver stone's underrated weakest films mentioned but i think it's his best in my opinion br br but definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background i still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored as matter fact i watched it tonight yeah if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film watch it at with the lights off i may sound crazy but it makes the film better br br another thing i forgot to mention is that the reason i don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title radio ' it doesn't sound very tricky or anything it's kind of plain a better title like the book talked to death or maybe the abusive radio host or something catchy and not plain talk radio or maybe because of universal pictures oliver stone usually didn't do universal i don't think paramount might have been a good company i don't know something about this film didn't do so well but i love it br br sticks and stones can break your bones but words can cause permanent damage
<START> this film could have been a decent re make and gosh knows it tried or ms english tried assembling talented actors together with a successful experienced writer director should be a formula for a decent film but ms english's experience according to her imdb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film br br i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini series or a sit com i think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms english's talents didn't translate i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo typed role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s and no one helped ms english get the changes updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance i think it could have been good but it was not br br it's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time money this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate a few movie execs are having a meeting the caption reads let's remake a classic with worse everything
<START> for the record the 1949 version of the blue lagoon is not the original film as many have stated br br this story was filmed in great britain in 1923 just after the novel was written as much as i'd love to see the 1949 version i'd thoroughly enjoy an opportunity at seeing the true original release of this story on film br br granted the 1980 film with christopher atkins brooke shields and the two youngsters was filmed with beautiful cinematography the acting didn't seem all that great when i first viewed this film but after having viewed this a few times it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without adult guidance would indeed have a simplistic way of approaching life whether it be in their language appearance or daily activities br br although some have been fortunate enough to view the 1949 blue lagoon i cannot help but wonder if there is anyone living who can remember the 1923 release of this story to film
<START> among the many accolades here for this production there was one individual whose comments asked if he she were the only one who wasn't that enthralled by it i e giving this film 3 stars however the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story and other production of same well this person isn't the only one who didn't like this production include me but there i part company even with him her if you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again i'd watch it certainly but i'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it i'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement or having to watch paint dry on a wall though further i wouldn't want to see this story again anytime anywhere or in any alternative presentation sometimes you feel like comedian george pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo and this is one of those for me i liked angela lansbury in a favorite movie of mine long hot summer and while not a huge fan of the show enjoyed murder she wrote but here i not only didn't care for the story or other aspects but i found angela's squealing squawking singing and everything else about her over the top performance perhaps the most annoying presence in any movie or presentation in any other media i've ever experienced it was like an unending continuation of audrey hepburn's equally over the top cockney at rex harrison in the earlier portions of my fair lady but that was incident to the plot presented for light comedic effect and mercifully brief this was anything but brief and to me seemed as if it had gone on for about 10 hours einstein's layman's explanation of relativity at work if i hadn't been with friends with the necessity to remain my viewing would have been brief i laughed though at the seinfeld episode where elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked the english patient my friends somewhat regarded me the same way when i interrupted their waxing over this movie give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead
<START> and boy is the collision deafening a female telephone is taken over by the spirit of a recently deceased ninja strips down to her undies pours tomato juice on her body so her boyfriend can lick it off performs a seductive dance then goes off to kill the policemen who killed the ninja she's possessed by only to be hunted down by a one eyed ninja master just like in real life eh enlivened only by sho kosugi's martial arts choreography and his declining to put his obnoxious kids in this one you really have to see this to believe it it's the ultimate mix of totally at odds genres
<START> i was totally disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to the poseidon adventure a movie which i have given a great comment about br br this film is unbelievable from the word go i agree why were no other rescues boats around and helicopters the one that rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat that michael caine sally field are on that was the only rescue crew hard to believe br br the acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap i really hated the waste of talent from some good actors br br don't watch this film unless you must catch sally michael as lovers br br
