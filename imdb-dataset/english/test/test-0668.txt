<START> i thought i was going to see a ufo movie instead i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience me make the decision to accept christ in my life or risk going to hell the whole ufo thing was one big red herring the acting in it was pretty pathetic in fact it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members it wasn't real life dialog at all i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn't have wasted my money on it if on the other hand you are into the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views no matter how limiting onto other people then by all means go see it
<START> you looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast well locate this little sleeper john lithgow and billy bob are great in this little plot twister don't forget the cameo by jamie lee curtis a touch of the 60's a touch of the prince and the pauper and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a little story
<START> i'll admit that the first time i managed to catch sci fi's sci fi prime was last week but despite the fact that i was a huge sliders fan coming into the experience farscape is now easily my favorite of the four shows br br unlike most modern sci fi shows including regrettably the two new star trek series this show manages to be fun without coming across as fodder for mst3k
<START> czech movie goers may have enjoyed and rated this film highly because it was czech but i found it to be trite tedious moronic boring and insipid again i suspect ramping in order to increase sales of this dog of a film amazon describes this film as being about a couple of fellows that refuse to grow up but i will go one further i think it is about two fellows that have entered a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone i have been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film and i would believe it when he saw his performance he probably realized what a gosh awful job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the big exit which i am sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in autumn spring don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance it's nothing but a dog in a manger
<START> every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen it's cinema very at its best br br lackawanna blues is that film set in 1960s upstate new york the story surrounds a rock solid woman who is the foundation for her community this based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own this child ruben santiago hudson wrote the screenplay br br emmy winner s stars as nanny a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home she does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover bill crosby played by the oscar nominated terrence howard br br but make no mistake see this film for the amazing performance of who is brilliant in this role she encompasses a person we have all known and perhaps love br br lackawanna blues is already on dvd be sure to pick it up at your local video story today br br has already won an emmy golden globe and screen actors guild for this role br br howard has an oscar nomination for his role in hustle flow
<START> this is a strange little forgotten movie from the late eighties it's one of those large cast kitchen sink movies that delivers some good gags if you like the people in this one give it a shot
<START> reading through most of the other reviews i tend to agree with most of the comments the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual sometimes jerky camera angles and flitting from one scene to another it goes down well with these movie festivals and with some of these indie type critics but it spoils the movie for me i noticed in the reviews one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters this would maybe prove my point as the film has that to feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow as for the comment about kiefer sutherland being a big name to put on the poster i would bet he cringed when watching the final cut this is a story with real potential spoilt by trying to be different in it's production worth watching but not many would come back for a second view
<START> this is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shreds even being a hardcore mario fan can make you dislike this game you can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics not a nintendo fan huge excitement music or game play i know a lot of people that say it is amazing and others who think its the worst mario ever it really depends on the type of nintendo fan you are i personally love this game and i think it is the best wii game but you should determine that for yourself so i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right nintendo fan but if you love the classics too much you may not like it so try it out yourself
<START> an extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast one of the few shows that i try to watch on a regular basis glad to see bebe in a recurring role but feel andre braugher is underutilized he is one intense actor hope cbs gives it a better time slot next season
<START> this program is certainly my favorite non sitcom television comedy australia produces very little good programs most of the tv which i watch and i live in australia is from the us and england br br the funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is like when they went past numerous security barriers at the summit pretending to be canadian diplomats br br the show is made up of pre filmed stunts general satirical discussion of current world events and sometimes on stage skits these all come together to make a fabulous extremely funny tv show the segments like ad road test and message from osama bin ladin are hilarious for anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical tv comedy then this is definitely the show you should watch br br all the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour br br i would rate it 10 10
<START> i am so impressed really i expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else br br ok there's a ton of pretty geeky humor but the movie is so well done the acting is quite good br br the dialog while gamer cheesy at times i guess to cater to the gamer crowd is not bad at all at times it's even dare i say great br br when the female gamer who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual min max type gets all these additional attacks seem right i did not check the rules it was cool br br the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie br br the story moves right along the transitions from game world to real world are well done a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female and sometimes by himself pretty clever i thought br br the guy who decided to play a female but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs he even said tag at one point and the female walked on to play the role sorry i did not look her name up she did great though the guy always trying to get some got a bit tedious but i guess that was more gamer humor br br there was just so much to like about the movie lighthearted fun very well done and i am saying that as a movie fan not a gamer and i am not a d d player as i said i expected so much less br br movies often don't hold my attention i end up listening to them while working on my computer this one held my attention i can't give a movie much higher praise
<START> got this off of usenet so i wasn't prepared for the heavy and i do mean exceptionally heavy religious theme not that i'm one of satan's disciples or anything but it was very heavy handed br br on top of that the acting stunk it might be because they had to get good little boys to play bad little boys but it didn't work br br there was some pretty cool filmmaking involved so any fan of directorial style might want to check it out but be ready with the fast forward buttons br br there was some sloppiness to the editing in particular a black mustang probably a representation of satan squares off against a white wheels spin camera changes and know that white is into a white civic br br i gave up early on so i can't vouch for the moral impact of it but i would like to point out that this sort of film is totally preaching to the choir if the director writer producer was trying to bring religion to the unwashed masses they went about it all wrong i think i'd rather watch an adult diaper commercial than listen to a steely gazed bible thumper rant about jesus' dying for us yawn br br
<START> along with virtually every republic picture ever made murder in the music hall seems to have faded into oblivion a shame because this lusciously produced expertly directed and written and crafty mystery suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of radio city music hall a murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious among them vera ralston who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and provides a few dazzling ice skating production numbers helen walker ann rutherford julie bishop and several other delectable b movie starlets of the '40s tall blond and handsome william marshall usually cast in musicals hunts down the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds against the swankiest settings you'll ever see in a film noir the ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten classy murder mystery well worth restoring and reviving on cable tv vhs or dvd republic sank a hefty budget in this grade a production and murder in the music hall is as slick unnerving and immensely enjoyable as any of the major studios' films of its era possible spoiler pay attention to the song composed by the victim just before his death then amidst the incessant chattering in their dressing rooms try to pinpoint the one humming that fatal melody you'll discover who the killer is just as william marshall does grand fun the kind of movie they truly don't make anymore and what a loss both to movie goers and actors alike
<START> i've read many unflattering comments regarding this film and the only things i have seen that they all have in common are boring and unrealistic br br first of all they used real frickin' crocs how much more realistic can you get no cgi no animatronics no miniatures just a croc and a piece of meat have fun fellas br br there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start character development what little they had anyway does take a bit of time and i think this is primarily where this film lacks br br however when the film gets going i found the action picked up dramatically i don't mean to say that there is a lot of action if anything there are more moments where the croc can't be seen at all and the people are just waiting however we know that there isn't going to be any relief and that the croc is just biding its time this had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through non action such as open water another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being boring personally i think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth but that's just me br br finally the characters feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times it's a little tough to watch br br all in all this one's a winner
<START> i finally got hold of a dvd copy of this production and was with curiosity since i had read so many people praising it to the skies particularly angela lansbury's portrayal of mrs lovett i saw the tim burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me br br to begin with the casting george is adequate and at least shows some expression as opposed to johnny depp's unending wooden face in the movie angela lansbury is quite simply annoying at least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to helena bonham carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to ms lansbury one cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a look ma i'm acting fashion and being far too aware of the audience this is not something that is typical of stage productions heaven knows i have been a regular of many productions at the for many years and stage actors do not behave in that fashion as a rule at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not br br betsy joslyn oh dear oh dear oh dear did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately and her playing george daughter is just creepy considering that she was married to him at the time isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen year old yes i realize that this is what acting is all about but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty five and the phrase mutton dressed as lamb seems to have been coined just for her her butchering of green finch and bird had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the dvd player at once that song was done so well in tim burton's movie and this was a sad shock the song requires the vocal range of julie andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano any vibrato at all kills it dead and ms joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that i thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes this is quite simply not a role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands br br cris was adequate but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and ms joslyn which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat i am reminded a little of past stage productions of wagner's ring cycle where due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous viking horned with a triple chin and a beard when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching the casting of the juvenile leads is exactly like that if you close your eyes you can almost believe in mr anthony but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered and at no time can you ever believe in ms johanna for me the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast i cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production i really can't understand why people rave about this badly shot and self conscious filming of a stage play surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just a camera down in the front row if i want that i'll go to a decent play preferably at the festival where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera i give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of lansbury and joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular br br probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play and then combine the two to make a bearable whole that's what i'm going to do and try to forget that i ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production
