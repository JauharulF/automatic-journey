<START> i started off being interested somewhat in the movie it appeared it might be serious drama dealing with death grief and healing with some realistic human conflict thrown in alas it didn't hold up br br i need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent look i know this was not supposed to be shakespeare but come on i need some quality in script and characterization br br the acting was alright the writing not so much at one point james brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under dressed he states that ordering him around will not work his new wife says that if he goes home and changes she will rip his clothes off later that is a howler this movie had a few unintentionally funny lines br br it was hard to care about jame's brolin's character when he so readily gave his first wife's things to his new wife even allowing his daughter to be snubbed i lost most of my sympathy who really cares what happens to him i must confess that i did not finish the movie if it did a 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes let me know it was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable i felt there was no need to finish it
<START> one of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others commercializing a 'shock' or 'gore' factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their birch a new diamond necklace another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by events dialog and images to the director's own liking lastly one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom of the barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day all three of these the makers of this film are guilty of this is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen thousands a score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand both the living and the dead
<START> k murli mohan rao made the much better in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singer br br basically in short the film consists of salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenes br br jackie wasted bored and tired his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of pooja then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer br br inder kumar confusing characterization again br br rani mukherjee boring overweight and does nothing special pooja tall fair and actress worthy but lacks talent br br shah says a dial as if a poetry br br behl poor fellow the 2 kids were awful too br br the story is the same and has awful comic scenes a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of shakti kapoor br br direction is poor music is decent br br salman khan just goes through the motions jackie is bad rani is as usual pooja is bad and are nothing great inder is awful
<START> this is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie no make that any movie i have ever watched shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap i never ask for a refund on any movie but i think this will be a first br br the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it br br i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping br br the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster
<START> i can't get over the quality of the score the book and the performances this is the first production i've ever seen of sweeney todd so i have no others to compare it to but the impact is so strong i just can't imagine anything better br br first there's the music take johanna act ii during which sweeney anthony and johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs it's like a bach in that sense just a masterpiece of composition and the underlying chord structure and are so perfect a little bit of melancholy a little bit of contentment a little bit of yearning all expressing these three points of view br br then the lyrics the rhymes are so clever the rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end the dvd which i watched has closed captions and these are indispensable for appreciating the dialog and the lyrics sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone br br finally the performances i can't imagine anyone better than george why haven't i heard of him before his singing alone is masterful but the range of his acting is simply amazing angela lansbury totally surprised me the song about you and me down by the seaside who could do it any better her timing is flawless pitch is perfect every beat of the score is accounted for and this achievement in musicianship is her utterly delightful comic delivery br br it's a dark tale but i found it to be sweet at times and the tune to johanna continues to play in my head
<START> this is one dreary inert self important bore when the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging you know the venture is botched philip seymour hoffman plays truman capote as a narcissistic tic ridden self indulgent cartoon voiced insect like caricature why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information the script focuses on capote's writing of 'in cold blood' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four the acclaimed writer of 'to kill a mockingbird' harper lee catherine keener accompanies capote in his initial inquires into the crime and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic unfortunately lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of capote bemoaning his pained existence watching him is like watching dr smith from 'lost in space' complain about his delicate back to anybody who will listen for two hours the difference however is that smith was fun to watch while capote is not the film's precious self importance kills it as does director bennett miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading like the morose piano score the film is a one note wonder providing no contrast no emotional coloring and no intimate drama if capote really was this irritating why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it though the supporting roles are well performed chris cooper is his usual stalwart self they serve such little dramatic purpose because ultimately it's all about capote director bennett and screenwriter dan futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of capote's legend their product is stillborn oscar bait and is more evidence that one great genre pic has more truth in it than a dozen piles of oh so sincere crap like this
<START> the film's executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation david lynch the director's father i wonder what david's guru his holiness maharishi mahesh yogi would have thought of this production the hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself it's a safe bet that samuel l phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence would have loved every minute of it br br i doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft on that level it's quite good but on a moral level it's the most disheartening movie i've ever seen br br spoiler coming br br i guess it's the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most morally numb generation learn a craft and a little post modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts and entertainment industry and here's the result a film which wallows in human suffering injustice and carnage much of which is witnessed by a nine year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational violence killers who at the end ride off into the sunset br br no more spoilers coming br br for whom are films like this produced sadists are going to adore this why wouldn't they but who else as i noted above there's some really good film craft here but good craft can be applied to any subject matter why apply it to stuff like this also the movie is very suspenseful but that's not because of the grossness of the violence it's suspenseful because it's well directed well acted i'm sure the ghost of alfred hitchcock could explain this much better than i can br br so what has been put before us here and above all why br br yes our world can be an ugly dirty even evil place but shouldn't we dissent when an artist makes it her his business to rub our faces in it or worse still to stick it in the faces of those nine year olds who will one way or another end up seeing this on home dvd br br i hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids yeah i know dream on
<START> i'm amazed that memento which is an excellent flick is so well regarded in the top 250 and this one doesn't even appear what the hell is that to be honest when this movie ended my knee jerk reaction was that this movie is better than memento after the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off i concluded that they are equal in their excellence i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with memento i'm going to venture a guess that sadly it's because it's in black and white or because again sadly that the characters all have british accents sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this br br i'm telling you that if you loved memento you will love following as well brilliant
<START> this is a great movie i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it mainly for caroline it grew on me br br it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls young women are not punished for their sexuality the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions br br some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes which were not over the top or distasteful the male characters in the movie were brilliant david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much the other two younger male characters were good too without being overbearing br br this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them
<START> the movie blood and chocolate is nothing like the book the plot has totally changed and whoever chose the cast needed to read the book first the girl is not an introvert aden is vivian was the one that chased aden her mother was to have survived and be the one after gabriel astrid was the one that did all the murders along with ralf an ex of gabriel is not old he is old looking and aden did not get vivian in the end gabriel did the title came from vivian comparing kisses from aden sweet like chocolate and gabriel delicious like blood she picked blood because it promised more and he understood her more that reminds me gabriel is not against humans like in the movie he just avoids intimacy with them because they hurt him in the past really the book is sooooooo much better than the movie but if you want o see running a dating montage and a lot of jumping then this is the movie to see
<START> renee zellweger is radiant but the rest of this movie just does not work it's like a hamburger jello mold salad interesting idea but who ever thought it would actually work on film i like director labute's two previous films they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny this film manages only to be merciless and chilling with jumbo dollops of the as high concept think the doris day rock hudson movie sam peckinpah might have made now reduce your expectations to match the present mass produced state of hollywood that actors as talented as freeman kinnear vince and almost make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere i would have found freeman's corny feel good about yourself speech at the end of the movie funny in a way if it weren't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked on moral is meant to be accepted seriously
<START> in this dream come true i found myself loving what was going on it's a good movie and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie it's too smart for that it's definitely a feel good movie but with a nice message to leave you with 7 10 b 1 2 out of
<START> french cinema had always been very strong when comes the time to present historical subjects 95 of the time they never make errors this film is of one of the best of the genre due to very very strong acting by depardieu and work as the director is truly a wonder everyone should see this great film
<START> spunky journalist holly hunter produces investigative news reports for a major news network she's a motor mouthed maverick dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships enter william hurt and albert brooks two men who vie for her love br br brooks is an old school journalist who adores holly because she represents everything good about journalism they both believe that the media exists to test the gods educate the public and fight for truth children of the sixties they embody hippie values they're defenders of the public good knights who fight valiantly with pen and camera br br william hurt in contrast is a far more complex character initially awkward clumsy and self depreciating he gradually reveals himself to be a sexy and manipulative high skilled at climbing the corporate ladder unlike holly and brooks he's symbolic of modern media values news as spectacle journalism as entertainment news anchor as celebrity truth as subject to editing board we want to despise him and his blip time junk food journalism but we just can't quite manage it he's playing the game by its own rules do we condemn him for lacking a moral backbone do we condemn the game can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed how have these rules evolved br br this isn't lumet's and network and so the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions content to keep things on the level of light comedy it ends with hurt being promoted to london division and brooks being booted to a tiny community network holly having rejected both men remains caught between them the last bastion of media integrity this spunky reporter remembers her roots mourns the loss of brooks and warns herself to be on the guard of future william hurts br br it's a cute ending but compared to network the film seems positively trite vision is one in which global media despite its offers less meaningful information he foresees a world in which globalisation has homogenized cultures information has become subject to and a handful of media monopolies control all international news this is a world in which the truth is subject to meetings and economic interests a world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories br br perhaps this is why broadcast news which longs for the glory days of journalism ends on such a bittersweet note it knows what the future holds made in 1987 its been living it for at least a decade br br but today in the digital age things are even worse and have left a very small number of massive firms dominating the communication landscape with this has come the hyper commercialism of content the barrier between the creative editorial side and the commercial side all but collapsed today everyone might be able to start their own blog or website but these are grass roots affairs as the communication reach of the individual increases due to technological progress email internet electricity air mail etc the size of the individual's world increases likewise he must project his voice both further and louder futilely battling that deafening white noise the incessant verbal static that is the global community br br so ultimately you need two things according to democratic theory firstly you need a rigorous coming of people in power and people who want to be in power both in the private and public sector secondly you need a wide range of informed opinions on all important issues of the day in a democratic society the media system as a whole should produce this sort of culture unfortunately the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society br br 8 10 Â this is lightweight stuff but a witty script some funny moments and a brief cameo by jack nicholson elevate it above most other films about journalism interestingly unlike most films about the media it never dips into satire and instead plays things as a straight love triangle br br worth one viewing
<START> it has started quietly if your are looking for an action packed movie this is absolutely not the right choice all characters are slowly depicted on the scene stroke after stroke on the scene canvas none can take away his hands to the priest and so the sisters lifespan devotion can only remain into the village philippa and martina know their destiny belong only to the village so when you understand that you are on the movie scene in the village that becomes the whole known world in that time when no technology can let you imagine anything else than the campaign the village the sea you feel the rhythm of that ancient village's life watching the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can cause you to approach this evening dinner with some sumptuous expectations br br the final sentence that give a title to babette's sacrifice far from paris an artist is never poor br br superb photography many situations depict portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas there in jutland in 18th century
