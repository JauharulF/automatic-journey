<START> okay maybe this movie not a revolution but it a very good piece of entertainment and it's liv tyler's variation of alicia silverstone's clueless or cameron there's something about mary br br liv plays a femme fatale which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it and well she does everything to get just that even crimes many crimes and she drops every boyfriend which doesn't cooperate to get these things additionally she actually doesn't mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend br br this movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that liv is actually of zodiac sign cancer and cancer are reported to be very domestic so the character liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer br br i was alone in cinema when i watched this one that was quite comfortable because i could laugh as loud as i wished all the time but it also felt strange as if nobody was actually interested in this movie br br i myself liked it very much the acting was between very good to excellent especially the main actors where brilliant there where enough jokes many of the black kind and good dialogues br br this is a trash movie and it is full of black humor if you like this kind of movies try this one
<START> a friend and i went to see this movie we have opposite opinions about but after watching this movie we agree on the following the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really abusing their power to make it even worse the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with regime she decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to peruvians but this is not surprising because both the director and the cia are violating the sovereignty of peru by trying to affect the democratic processes at very different levels of course br br if the director was really interested in helping peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary in any case there are numerous peruvian made documentaries films and books about the subject such include ojos que no ven dias de santiago las dos de la etc the director of the fall of should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations
<START> this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest in many ways it's like a 50s version of valley of the dolls with much of the excesses and sleaziness of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959 like this later film both are about three young ladies who are on the fast track to success though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadway br br the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work she's assigned to tough as nails boss joan crawford who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades despite how nasty crawford seems lange is determined not to give in to make it in this job and over time she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor at the same time her two new roommates also try to move up the ranks one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy like valley of the dolls all of them have their ups and downs mostly downs but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it battered and bruised nevertheless br br in this film men are mostly pigs the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen boyd so naturally hope lange neglects him for a ne'er do well ex boyfriend as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian and the rest they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nasty br br this film has it all adultery premarital sex abortion etc and is certainly not an artistic triumph however thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script this one is a joy to watch just don't expect shakespeare
<START> i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is br br i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like search ufo and man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future adventure and technology br br you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it br br i did not know what this concept of a pilot was i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that stryker would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours br br back then would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now i doubt it because i don't remember it as such do i understand now not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie br br if one is watching as an american it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state but if one is a subject in that state then compliance could be expected and security can be less when things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order br br the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power br br these days one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it so much of the suspense surprise is lost but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns br br this is the primary difference between the stranger and doppelganger the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the ussr are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie in the former those links are through out the movie supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards br br all that said despite my fond memory for the movie it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series each week stryker would make friends benedict would chase stryker would get away eventually society would get rid of him someone else would pick up the chase a rut would develop there might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from mission showing up but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going br br if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie odds are they will slash it as well but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time of what the popular environment contained for the viewer then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it
<START> i can't see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 5 7 from imdb voters it's a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other catastrophes the sugar factory occasional coarse language russian doll sample people the secret life of us la spagnola strange planet fresh air dust off the wings doing time for patsy cline etc as a 19 year old uni student newton in perhaps his best role yet on par with at least with a bored over religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him and before you go thinking another goofy movie it's not there's some real substance here sure it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo jumbo aren't they and maybe the study of cusack's character is a little muddled at times but the film is bright funny and has some important messages the principle cast is terrific cusack and newton are wonderful and rose byrne see her also in the goddess of 1967 is so underrated it's not funny she's a beautiful fresh confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives i gave my mother frank 8 10
<START> never i have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane it was a huge waste of time seeing this crappy film there are a lot of things i hate about this movie the songs is so terrible yet a little bit catchy i hit my head on the wall especially from the song is gonna sue the pants out of which i hit 10 times shrugs the character design and that evil greedy and bitchy cousin mel br br i cannot stand her for one second she has got to be one of the most person i've seen even though i kinda like her southern voice br br the only bright side is that austin bucks is played by the person who is the voice of liquid snake from metal gear solid br br i would not recommended to people to watch for the holidays as it was a huge disgrace for x mas
<START> the initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what there is a scarecrow murdering people there only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people one by one whats the scarecrows secret will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all this is a low budget movie and it shows sound is ok but picture is really corny the plot script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical the acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable cant really say much about the special effects cause there aren't that many but the few there is ranges from bad to ok for a low budget that is there is some nudity and thats probably the only thing worth to watch in the movie that is if your a horny teenager if not skip the movie all together another complete waste of time and money so don't see it goes for fans too
<START> performance is very disappointing it seems she is trying to make up for her lack of emotion by substituting obscenities why the r rating includes is beyond me there is no nudity or steamy love scenes the plot is old and tired
<START> this was very energetic and well played show i saw it back in 98 and my friends and i still joke about it each time i watch it's always as funny as the first i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways i am very much looking forward to seeing more of john's own scripts and productions br br unfortunately i can't find it anywhere for sale and i've done quite a lot of looking if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject thankyou
<START> contain spoilers these guys are total scam they did the lost scrolls of judas saying judas was a huge friend of jesus and now this this is clearly a tryout to destroy a religion and should be illegal they have no proof it could be clearly a setup how can we know and trust these people what if they carved the tomb and said so and at the end they seal the tomb forever so no one can go there investigate how stupid they think we are really are we supposed to trust that they are trustworthy people who really found a tomb of jesus and how can you stab all the christians like this i think this documentary should never be made by a non religious man it can only be made by a christian and i mean the direction and script it should be illegal for jews to film a christian related documentary specially if the documentary makes accusations about jesus not being a son of god who resurrected nothing against this they could be buddhists or atheists anything but catholic br br to me this is a total hoax a pure documentary scam they sealed the tomb so people wouldn't think about checking things out this documentary is a total failure how stupid they think the christian people are and what about the lost pages of judas that was a total scam as well they seriously said at the end something like we know a few people that could do a fake scrolls just like these and no one would know it was a fake oh my god they just said it dude we might have done these this kind of documentary should be illegal it is a stabbing on all christians and catholics they should be behind bars i am not a fanatic i am an ex jew now but i have and will always respect others people religion the part when israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever was precious precious
<START> despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever amazing rappaport and woods this is another one of those moronic comedies where new york throws itself at the hero in an effort by the writer and or director to show what a zany place it is yeah there's some other stuff in the movie that sucks too but that's what's important the trend for new york independent filmmakers seems to be i don't need to be talented i have new york okay to be fair the movie has its moments the flashback bit about why the one guy is called wacky jack was pretty amusing the script isn't a story or a plot it's a bunch of not good scenes tied to each other by featuring the same character br br one of the worst things is that there's no motive behind what the characters do uncle sam has the kid deliver the drugs why if its so important why didn't sam do it himself then the lead character lies his ass off in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying the guy falls in love with a flight attendant with neither of them having any reason to fall in love the characters are a bunch of pawns for the writer to move around to see if he can get anything zany to happen br br if you're easily amused or like watching bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies watch this if you want to see what a good light hearted crime movie looks like watch takeshi kitano's brother kicked in the head is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies a lot of them suck and a note to the director don't be afraid to excite amuse enlighten or entertain the audience now and then being boring doesn't make you a better filmmaker than the ones who can interest me
<START> how any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me i made an account on imdb just to comment on this cr p film the acting is cr p and the plot is cr p it would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too most notably the ones featuring the and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt and quality cinematography the dialog and plot are about as complex as that of a dr book these actors are horrible i am actually watching this movie right now and with every word am stunned you all swallowed this the only reason i didn't turn the movie off was because i have gotten wrapped up in creating an account on imdb and posting this review i dig mainstream films i dig silly stupid films i dig retro indie films and nearly any other type genre if carried out well my brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has great taste in movies from the moment he told me the title i looked at him like he was crazy i'm having a tough time ending this rant because there is just so much badness to talk about the only way i can rationalize the good ratings on here is that you guys were paid to give this movie high ratings it is so poorly done and no where close to dramatic artsy complex well written well preformed or even bearable if this was the final product of my hard directorial work i would be to embarrassed to release it to the public so i don't even feel sorry for the director if he reads this what the hell were you thinking guy
<START> our america is multi cultural with so many sub cultures this movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub cultures it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world generally a good movie it entertained provoked thought and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise right in our own back yard should be seen by all having lived in the u s all my life i had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens this movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state the obvious conclusion if this is really for real then what else is out there that we know nothing of

<START> i didn't expect much from this movie it was just one of those movies i thought i'd just watch because it was on television i certainly underestimated this movie br br it's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends i was very happy with the acting they had the characters played well it was a particularly great scene when dennis hopper and john daniel roebuck are talking to each other about why john killed jamie it's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why but had loved the girl he had killed felt remorse while john felt nothing hell he was proud of what he'd done it really makes you think about people keanu reeves did a great job as matt and ione skye was good it's weird to see her as a valedictorian in 'say and her as clarissa every actor did great at acting it was real nice for a change it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it
