<START> the worst movie i've ever seen in my life from the amateur directing to the porn quality acting it looks like a home movie somebody decided to shoot becuase they had nothing else to do with their time br br unless you have no hope left in life absolutely avoid this crap br br
<START> this film has the guts to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of one's life and moving forward i felt slapped in the face but that's okay i don't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it great acting by streep and hurt and everyone else really and some wonderfully quirky scenes a serious film and take a hanky
<START> ugly women of the flick rakes the bottom of the midnight movie barrel combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls in the shower clichÃ©s linda blair plays an innocent sent to jail we learn she was involved in running over some guy with her car facing hard time in the big house with some of the nastiest characters this side of a russ meyer pic blair is continually pawed at punched raped humiliated and harassed the dialogue is four letter word disgusting throughout and the flick offers no let up from its barrage of violence and stupidity still some viewers see this as a camp classic though perhaps its tongue isn't far enough in cheek from
<START> i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time read the biography watched the specials and saw the karen carpenter story this movie really didn't show the real karen carpenter in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner except for one girl friend the real karen carpenter was much different she was outgoing and friendly she had lots of friends especially olive newton john the movie doesn't even show karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy karen itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york when karen was in new york she did see a psychologist but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room also karen was taking pills to increase her so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too also the karen's husband in the movie is named bob knight but in real life was named tom also karen wasn't divorced from tom but only separated karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died also agnes found karen naked in the closet unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white the music was very good that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it
<START> i wish there were more films about middle aged people the intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing there seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men amy watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man if she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce the country and london scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumnal weather adds to the melancholy background superbly the ending is perfect so in tune with real adult life
<START> there are about ten minutes about half way through when one suddenly sees the glimmer of an interesting idea themes of revenge and rehabilitation come into focus during robert englund's brief screen time sadly then resumes its course as a thoroughly predictable and boring slasher film
<START> may contain spoilers in no way shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold not by a long shot however it does deliver a creepy atmosphere believable enough characters and gore br br the story is simple and doesn't bother to itself anymore than it needs to a bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900's since then they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little pa town in the mountains br br simple they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago naturally his great great great grandson is in town and he's a real prick br br along with that a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies the eldest daughter is rebellious obnoxious a typical teen the younger is curious bright eyed and gets in with the ghost children br br the creepiest part of this flick is the sheer of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim excellent acting it was so spooky i mean the children of the corn flicks are one thing but this topped any of those as for the creepy kids br br a look i bought it before seeing it and i was not unhappy but i'm a horror fan through and through
<START> donald sutherland an american paleontologist visiting england picks up a hitch hiker one evening two years later having discovered the man's address book in his car he returns the book to the man's opulent home only to find that the man's been hanged for murder nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder of his own stepmother because he was in sutherland's car at the time of the crime br br sutherland is the man's alibi but he's turned up too late out of a sense of guilt he tracks down the real murderer br br agatha christie's mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people all of them with one or another motive for the crime all of them suspect and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line there is often not always a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over br br because of the of the situation due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer redundancy is perfectly okay we have to keep the characters and the time lines straight christie's movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful jacqueline de oh yes that's mia farrow but this version of ordeal by innocence is a golan globus production with all that implies in the way of production values a thoughtfully prepared script and skill behind the camera br br the first few minutes in which sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged are fine after that everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing the script has a slapdash quality as if thrown together by two hacks overnight few of the faces are familiar and that doesn't help at all everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble the musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating jazz riffs some nudity is thrown in to wake up the in the audience if dame agatha were alive she'd be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake br br dullsville
<START> as a true lover of film i must advise you to avoid this appalling effort god knows how funding was approved seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again the only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake the worst film i have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent one blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on and it will only last 25 minutes and you won't miss any of the plot br br no idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks
<START> wagons east was a big disappointment for me but the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john candy's last film role he died just before shooting was completed on this there are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof and for a comedy that doesn't cut it if you want to see a uproarious spoof of western movies the answer is obvious see mel brooks' classic blazing saddles or if you want to see candy in much better material see summer rental spaceballs or uncle buck just to name a few these three movies as well as others shows us what a great comic actor he was wagons east does not what a shame br br out of four
<START> crossing the bridge the sound of istanbul received one of the most rapturous applause from the audience when it ended and very deservingly so i did not expect too much from a musical documentary but the movie proved to be much more than that it was also a visual documentary of istanbul with stark contrasts of old and new western and eastern poor and rich modern and traditional black and white photographs of old istanbul by world famous photographer were exceptional but of course main theme was music and by god what a variety of it it was in a way similar to vistas social club the love and the respect of the interviewer alexander here replacing ray cooder for the musicians exuded from the screen and engulfed us all the music was mostly very interesting the jazz session by a group of romany gypsies in a small western turkish town was mind blowing i will not be surprised if the travel agents start getting group booking requests for after the movie is released but i most loved who looked amazingly elegant in a sort of burlesque way and whilst tipping her declared courageously my voice and i are 86 years old well done faith akin i bet there are many more turkish musicians who are feeling left out go for volume ii please
<START> this was the most thought provoking capital punishment movie ever it refused to seem one sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get this movie had one of the most 'human' and i use this term in a good way compassionate religious character ever this movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book which is rare for me sister helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious which is also rare and it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out and we have the director to thank for that this is not a film for entertainment but it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart i can't think of another film like it
<START> some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979 that much said it really is pretty dire br br never mind the laughable back projection or the awful awful camera tracking of supposed in flight objects it's the stunts that the concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity barrel rolls loop the loops and violent evasive maneuvers left me wondering why the air forces of the world didn't just fly as their main fighters br br so here are the important lessons i learned from this celluloid cheese fest br br 1 the concorde is at least as agile as a phantom 4 jet fighter br br 2 you can fire a flare gun at mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out br br 3 if the flare gun fails to discharge do not drop it as it may then go off br br 4 the concorde can dodge up to two sidewinder missiles fired at it at once br br 5 a flare will distract a heat seeking missile every time br br 6 switching off your jet engines is a sure fire way of throwing heat seeking missiles off track if 5 above fails br br 7 when performing a crash landing in the concorde it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand br br 8 concorde pilots are all combat trained veterans br br as you might imagine this film is not very realistic the effects are primitive by today's standards and that coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the concorde performs makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn br br not recommended not recommended at all
<START> first let me confess that i have not read this particular balzac novel so maybe i am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor still my experience with balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist not an this is most certainly a film worth one's while but one is left sorely puzzled at the end was the colonel a fraud used by the lawyer for his own ends or for whose beyond himself or was the colonel not a fraud but used as aforesaid by the lawyer or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest colonel the director and or the editor appear to me to have deliberately obscured these questions which doesn't seem like balzac the realist at the same time the film does an excellent job of delineating the characters if not their motives and the cast and production is superb that opening battlefield scene is bound to haunt one's dreams still one wonders at the all too common penchant among contemporary film makers to favor ambiguity above all else weren't the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for yves angelo
<START> i'm a fan of get shorty this is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel br br chili is back but rene russo is gone without a peep unfortunately game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal arc for him they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie it's pretty tepid travolta looks old here it's like they move people around him because his bones are getting creaky his pink lip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very weird the 2nd bad role is edie played by uma thurman she's a music producer a role that requires her only to be the female reuben kincaid hey these kids have a great new sound in any scene she strikes the wrong pitch or emotionally or both it's painful to watch despite it's plentiful problems be cool gets better after a very unpromising start br br i certainly got my laughs out of it vince vaughan running around on fire cedric the entertainer ludicrous the rock a t shirt that says widow on it but it offers no great memories after it's over it's a helium light love fest from the first frame there's no one as pricelessly idiotic as gene hackman in the first movie it's just about doing good in the world for a couple of kids who deserve a chance beyonce the rock ho hum the first one wasn't preachy br br working in repeatedly gags lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb concession to the rock's wrestling fans he raises his eyebrow twice as are the droll inside jokes steven tyler saying i'm not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies ar ar br br the all star spectacular line up is part of the problem the first movie wasn't burdened by stars br br for a buck rental let's call it even
