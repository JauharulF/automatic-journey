<START> i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all no surprise it's what crispin glover's character does he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his the killer's girlfriend not because did not like this individual rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do this poor boy is bored in life and dead inside that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on
<START> what bergman has got here is what if all that bad stuff happened here in sweden to nice people like us and what he gives us in the swedish language with swedish actors on swedish locations and using what appear to be genuine swedish military vehicles is what was familiar from war films set in almost every other country in europe all the confusing invasions and counter invasions political lies camps faked confessions summary executions torture turncoats collaborators and so on as in a modern short story it's done in the abstract with no real names cities or countries used but the stronger faction are nazis they strut about self importantly and some wear shiny knee boots one even whips things with a riding crop ok it's actually a cane the victimized couple are named rosenberg apart from the shame they feel at finding dirtier ways to survive and who would not do what they did what all of the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to de facto complicity with the nazis indeed what we are shown is what sweden might have looked like if germany had asked for a bit more than mining concessions br br the first half plays like a black comedy we see the fog of war from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignore the troops all around the long convoys the bombed out buildings the news reports c they do not even bother to find a working radio they are the ultimate in not in my backyard they talk of wine and meanwhile friends are mysteriously conscripted and growing numbers of troops show up in the town they show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years br br the man von sydow is cultured sulky and a navel the woman ullman is somewhat more impulsive passionate and outward looking there's a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin the manufacturer he says fought in the napoleonic wars but his own interest stops with the cultural artifact in his hand or more precisely which his own warm feelings about owning it and the security that that ownership assumes not in my backyard but when war finally breaks into their bucolic idyll the man's timidity an irritation in good times turns into a liability one he ends up overcompensating for as is often the case as bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully definitely worth seeing
<START> okay last night august 18th 2004 i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr van at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival here's what i have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i've ever seen second of all in a short q a session after the show mr van immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and i'm assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative so i had second on questions i asked if he was trying to present the outsider mtv sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously off the by now sloshed director who started shouting f you shut the f up this is the truth all those other movies are bullsh br br well anyway i didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film you've heard the laws side of the story now hear the story as it is told by the manson family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with how in god's name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen this film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual br br the film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie's work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented br br all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of bullsh books or make a bunch of bullsh movies etc etc case in point even the disclaimer based on a true story is a dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead br br all i can say is this when the film ended i got a free beer so i'm glad i went but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f up for asking the director a question peace
<START> this was one of the worst columbo episodes that i have seen however i am only in the second season br br the typical columbo activities are both amusing and irritating his cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before and the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer in this case cooking tho the scene on the tv cooking show distracted from the main theme br br also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer the reason was never explained nor did it serve any purpose but the part i disliked the most was the death of the bride to be this was never explained and it is the main reason why i give this episode such a low grade
<START> do not be misled this is not a zombie movie take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all the good and the horrendous yes this movie has an extended zombie sequence but it's basically an artsy fartsy exercise in existentialist dread which is a long way of saying it's boring if you've worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained rent something else br br rise of the undead has cheap special effects mediocre acting and crummy dialogue all of that is understandable in an indie low budget film and i can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell unfortunately rise of the undead hardly has any story at all moreover the acting is not laughably bad so much as non existent all of the actors seem to have studied at the buster keaton school of wooden faces would it have killed them to show some emotion and no yelling does not equate with emoting the one character who actually had some pizazz was killed off first granted there was another character who briefly held my interest he looked and acted like kyle mclachlan channeling norman bates but it was too little too late br br the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail film is a visual medium that means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view what's going on and all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing there is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple clear fashion just look at george romero's low budget night of the living dead to see how it's done superbly and i know these folks had a small budget but if you can't hire the equipment and technicians necessary to actually make the dialogue audible then just go ahead and make a silent movie then those buster keaton wooden faces might actually work br br i will say this for the film the zombies were creepy unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory the grosser the better the zombies here were just shuffling bloody faced people it actually worked to make them more like us and therefore scarier that's the reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 br br the sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws rise of the undead does not insult your intelligence the filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart scary original movie and it's a shame that they failed so miserably if they could just forego the too fancy editing buy a few extra crank up the dialogue and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere then i think they have the talent to make something really good br br trust me do not waste your time on rise of the undead
<START> i am a 20 year old bloke from england i don't cry at films but this one moved me i cried like a girl this is absolutely the most moving film i have ever seen even though the story was questionable joseph little face when he dreams of crying made me sob every time how could anyone hurt such a sweet looking kid i'm going to cry now just thinking about it remarkable
<START> i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand what i found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people i know br br great moments between characters Â including many of morrison and scenes together Â were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through beautiful and ill fitting phrases rattled away from lawrence in particular as if he were the new messiah at his pulpit of beer crates br br when watching any film with actors i've found that i can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life with crooked earth i struggled to find one key character that rung true for the entire two hours most Â including and Â wound up saying or doing things that i didn't understand and couldn't connect with by the end of the movie the writer had succeeded in alienating the audience where the weren't able to relate to it and the were therefore given license to dismiss it my feeling is that the movies message Â or at least the main one of several that was being at the audience Â is important enough to avoid using character extremities unfortunately no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to pass this piece of advice on br br the soundtrack was invasive and as irritating as that horrible bing noise that they laced through eyes wide shut' the audience was not so subtly auto cued to laugh cry or be angry when the music changed it reminded me of darth vader's entrance music in star wars obvious and mildly amusing br br i think that there are some people out there that might enjoy this film it's funny in parts has a fair amount of action and has some really powerful scenes calvin and quentin did bang up jobs as well as a whole though i didn't enjoy the experience as much as i know i should have barb wire speed 2 the island of dr moreau and crooked earth look like they're going to be quartet of crap

<START> this movie is about a very delicate argument and if you are searching for something that makes you think here you are right tim robbins has made a wonderful job and the result is a kind of docu drama that should be shown in schools for the strong themes treated what about the actors well they are simply great susan sarandon is truly 'the face of love' and sean penn is unbelievable as almost always an absolutely must see
<START> buyer beware the alpha video release uses a print that defies description the movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so the print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned after 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes keep in mind even at it's best the color is pale and washed out it looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that i can recollect even the voice over narration is stupor inducing every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor i found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end it's one of those so bad it's good movies but i wish that someone would find a half decent print
<START> i recently visited the magic kingdom as an adult with my mom her best friend and my adult sister disney world is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children but when you see quality shows like you realize that the magic of disney is for everyone it was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again and then a third time it was absolutely breathtaking i would encourage anyone who goes to disney world to check out this show which is not just a show but a world wind fun filled ride with donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble
<START> in relative terms having watched a lot of disgustingly bad tele tom fontana levinson are geniuses for creating delivering in this writer's book the greatest ever tv show oz was treated horribly in this country the finale went out well gone 3 in the morning before that it was strictly considered alternative viewing for those oblivious to prime time garbage br br i first caught oz towards the end of the first series and from then on it was an unmissable watch my man possibly the most intimidating villain ever the perfect anti hero walker's an acting class in evocation there was the hardcore stuff of course some plain evil but essentially oz had soul augustus narrates the unfolding plot with pearls of insight while the struggles of mcmanus etc are better than any soap opera before or since compassion violence wisdom tragedy intelligence pain joy brutality love heroism oz went through the spectrum of human emotion all inside a max security prison br br i can honestly say those thursday nights with the great to follow oz series 2 3 way back in 99 were the best tv i'll ever see assaulting vern in the gym is a moment i don't need a video for a small screen classic i'll never forget br br imagine what oz would have done with the same push as the sopranos given a 10 pm timeslot and all the promos fine i'm over that now for those that caught it consider yourself privileged for those who didn't tv is shite and you deserve it
<START> another black comedy that won an oscar for best screenplay starring george c scott this redefines the phrase tearing a new a hole in this case the target is america's and grand hospital system throughout the hospital patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being changed scott roars screams and blasts away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more his comment about dachau to one of his many bosses is sure to elicit laughs he even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times this is one that has to be seen and heard as the monologues and soliloquies are the key points in the film
<START> this movie was really funny the people that were expecting to see an oscar worthy comedy should get over themselves this was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters plot lines dialog quotes and catch phrases i rate a movie a 10 if i have bought the dvd or in this case the videotape and have watched it many times and in this case still laugh out loud i have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the oscars again this was just a fun light hearted movie i hope this comes out on dvd i highly suggest checking this movie out if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy
