<START> i am a long time fan of luc besson's work and for about as long as i've known his name i've also looked for this movie i tried looking for this movie all over california for over four years this past summer i took a trip to europe one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie long story short i bought it and watched it in france i was blown away it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen luc besson's first work absolutely amazing character development very thought provoking great acting and the ultimate concept movie if you are a concept movie fan this is one of the most original and classic i feel as though it is a rare treat to see a movie like this one its risky its unorthodox and ultimately its just downright unique if you are a luc fan its indeed a must see however whether your a fan or not its definitely an important work overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema
<START> continuing with the exclusive film programme about complicated relationships in some european courts last night in the schloss theatre was shown anna boleyn a film directed by the great teutonic film director herr ernst lubitsch the film depicts the terrible story of the queen consort of the british king henry viii she was executed by her husband well not exactly the king ordered the executioners to do his dirty work not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event the english br br the film stars dame henny germany's first screen superstar during those early years and herr emil jannings germany's actor in that silent era both play their characters in a suitable way dame as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and herr jannings as the unscrupulous whimsical and womanizing british monarch a character very suitable for this german actor who overacts appropriately given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself br br in the early film period herr lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films colossal productions with big budgets anna boleyn cost about 8 million marks a fortune even for this german count taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in abbey scene which employed 4 000 extras idle germans of that time were used causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when german president friedrich ebert visited the set during filming br br besides the spectacle one of the most important aspect of this and every film of herr lubitsch even during his epic period is the complex relationship between the main characters we experience a game of different interests double meanings and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy the importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between henry viii and anna boleyn br br and now if you'll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesn't lose her head for this teutonic aristocrat br br herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http ferdinandvongalitzien blogspot com
<START> this movie literally had me rolling on the floor well at least on the couch laughing i didn't think i would like it but it came on cable tv one afternoon and i watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself since then i've also seen black sheep which was pretty good but not as non stop funny as tommy boy
<START> this movie was really funny even though it wasn't meant to be the acting was stupid and so were the voices pretty much all it was was some guy walking around a corn maze for an hour and a half they threw in this stupid super natural thing that made it even dumber it wasn't even like a normal movie this weird creepy music was playing almost the whole way through the movie what is it with corn maze horror films children of the corn was really scary i thought and i thought this would be something like it but really it was just stupid the main character guy just walked around aimlessly yelling for these two little girls and then at the end he like kills someone or something it's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is but if you're looking for a horror movie then don't waste your time
<START> axel cassavetes shows up on the new york looking for a job but with a hidden past he gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to surly crew boss jack warden while there he strikes up a friendship with black man sydney poitier that unfortunately leads to a gut wrenching moral dilemma for a man who we learn typically runs from his problems br br the movie looks like oscar winner on the waterfront feels like on the waterfront and most importantly plays much like that 1954 kazan production however its racial theme is ground breaking for the time the black poitier and the white cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect it might even be called the first of the black white buddy pictures that would later dominate so many action films br br it helps that the two leads play so well off each other nonetheless the movie's central flaw is failing to indicate why crew boss poitier pushes a friendship with the dour cassavetes in the first place he really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer but why he would cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested one possible explanation is that poitier wants to use cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with other crew boss warden but then comes to genuinely like the guy there's a hint of that in some of cassavetes's suspicious reactions but beyond that the relationship appears unmotivated br br if there's a single stage shot in the entire movie i couldn't spot it everything is done on seedy new york location without the usual movie extras in that sense it's an anti hollywood production carefully even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real after hours crowd i suppose would dub this rather raw slice of life a glimpse of the working poor br br yet for all its virtues which are many the film remains too close to the brando kazan movie for comfort here a fine unknown actress kathleen maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend warden the role of the corrupt labor boss while cassavetes like brando must suffer a bloody beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing still and all despite the derivative nature the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original force to merit a look see
<START> i found the movie judas kiss excellent carla performance was extraordinaire probably her best in her career her facial expressions in many scenes were unbelievably true to character and they were exploited to its best by director all actors and actresses were very good in their performances emma was as usual marvelous her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character so she actually enhances it in the movie br br the story although sometimes over intricate is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end very very good a movie not to be missed a story well weaved and brilliantly directed quality of film excellent
<START> i just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on youtube for a low budget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish while there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad the young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and i'm not surprised she posed for the cover of playboy some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous for the most part however don't look in the basement that's the title i saw on youtube provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining b movie
<START> for me north and south books i ii is the ultimate tv series of the 80's just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining gene kelly james stewart elisabeth taylor olivia de havilland robert mitchum even johny no series has come close to this achievement have you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln dick smith's prosthetics made hal powerful performance even more so the crafted costumes the jaw dropping locations everything it's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series desperate housewives lost 24 but north south was and still is one of its kind don't miss it only david carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain you may call him just violent husband worths the viewing maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them i'm so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain
<START> when i first heard of this movie i was mildly interested the plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and bam as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good when i found out the movie starred ryan dunn i was even further interested i was a fan of when it was on yeah i'm that lame however i didn't have much faith in it being to good when i sat down to watch it i was afraid i was wasting my time br br but even just five minutes it it became apparent that i'd been wrong br br i thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic and definitely not suited for all kinds of people the acting was rather good much better than my expectations i thought that it was rather easy to relate to ryan's character which gave the movie a center that was believable this is key in a movie as outrageous as this and is probably why i was not a fan of borat br br the movie is not suitable at all for younger people duh and will definitely create more than it's fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents but it's a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night
<START> this movie is a classic kids now will love it and people like me who were kids when it first came out still watch it for its nostalgic value as well as for its humor and great story it introduces kids to different cultures and inspires them to adventure it's not just a cartoon it's a masterpiece i love it
<START> it's saturday it's raining and i think every movie should have at least one comment so i just watched the crime doctor's courage all the way through it's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a couple of the usual suspects each with their own possible motive for the crime the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever i guess that's not too surprising for a b movie of this period there are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre wwii but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows br br the crime doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some r r from his psychiatry practice on the east coast he hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth aka dr watson and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief sort of br br there is also a somewhat simple but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth and then there are the mysterious a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night club the dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's though the story location is california the appear to live in a castle br br there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused but i won't divulge any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered rather than known in advance even though i can think of many many b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent i have not seen any other movies from the crime doctor series so i can't make any comparisons
<START> wow what a racist profane piece of celluloid garbage and what an insult to the great genre of westerns br br exploitive sex scenes abound profanity abounds violence and gore abounds everything that gives modern movies such a good name especially among those who prefer classic era movies this is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against today's films br br somehow i just can't picture nude male bathing scenes in randolph scott or gene films nor can i picture hearing motherf er exclaimed here and there i sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago yet the f word is so prevalent here you'd think you were watching a story centered in today's urban areas not the old west of the 1800s br br prejudice well what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty brutal villain do you think someone might complain about a racist movie home come we don't hear an outcry when the reverse as demonstrated in this film is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country br br mario van peeples wrote directed and starred in this bomb remember that name apparently he is the ed wood of today's filmmakers even spike lee wouldn't be this racist you can't get much worse than this movie
<START> i was expecting a lot from this movie and i can say i haven't been disappointed first of all this movie as a world tour of wine making let the spectator enjoy beautiful places the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too in particular hubert de the shooting may be confusing the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds you may not like it but i don't consider it as a defect br br the themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well since globalization isn't the only issue discussed but managed to give his movie a consistency all along a great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are avoiding a clichÃ© good against evil this could be the main difference between and michael moore's documentaries point of view appears in a subtle way through opinions expressed by his favorite characters the richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters the history of long time wine making families such as the de the the and the lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families rather than just being a business and an industry this movie doesn't make you want to drink wine but certainly make you want to discover and wine makers br br i watched this movie as a student in and let's just there are many ways to learn i give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite his technical particularities
<START> i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it and i really found what i expected a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody therefore film stays as average for all br br whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours to fit the short story in a full movie length some scenes are added without a connection with the main story these are mostly the ice cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people i e goat old women etc and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs the subject is mentioned as a universal problem struggle of a local producer against holding companies and monopoly but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before most of the readers will remember the hero grocer against supermarket from ferhan sensoy in 1980's this was the correct story at correct time shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now br br except some due to local accent the performance of cast is so successful the leading role is played by turan with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too br br on the other hand against limited budget appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo realists or worth to be oscar nominee br br note in the real life normally the ice cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of brand
<START> first and foremost i am a gay man although do not live my life within the so called community and it's because of films like this that gay themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90 of them are crap like this one f i could give this a zero i would i do not understand all the positive comments unless they were all made by people who made this film i actually stopped this at the 24 minute mark when the so called straight anthony kissed adam outside the restaurant for no reason at all and how is the son stealing from the diner if he doesn't even live in the town wire transfers the acting was horrendous the sound editing listen to anthony and adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch every time the camera switched between the two so called actors the sound changes like there was not a filter on the microphone seriously do not rent or god forbid buy this movie horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid storyline
