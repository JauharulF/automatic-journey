<START> an excellent sleeper of a movie about the search for carlos the international assassin am surprised this film didn't rake in 100 million plus because it's much better than most films that do so rent it now
<START> hong kong filmmaker chang chang ho's 1972 martial arts movie epic five fingers of death is widely considered by a great many film experts and kung fu movie fanatics to be the martial arts movie that started it all br br being released in 1972 it was phase two of the three step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts movies in the west billy jack 1971 with its famous showdown in the park was released the year before and bruce lee starred in enter the dragon 1973 two years later thereby martial arts movies' place in western cinema br br but what is all the hoopla about regarding five fingers of death the movie with its terrible dubbing explosive if not highly improbable action sequences and technical flaws and all has a plot albeit a very thin one chih the late lo lieh is a young and dedicated student of chinese gong fu who is selected to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts tournament his teacher offers to allow him to self train in the iron fist style of fighting a style so deadly that it could very easily kill a man with only one blow br br additionally chih arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school its students and a trio of murderous heavy hitters from japan before you know it a major setback threatens chih training and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament br br let me just say that five fingers of death is in fact the movie that started it all as another viewer mentioned five fingers of death helped to set a lot of standards in martial arts movies over the next three decades asian european and north american martial arts movies such standards include the dedicated student the learning of patience and endurance conflicts between rival schools the intense ethnic animosity between the chinese and japanese and learning a system of fighting for that good old fashioned action movie motive revenge five fingers of death would also serve as a major influence on american filmmaker quentin tarantino's kill bill movies tarantino borrows quite liberally from this project among many others just so you know br br the acting is pretty good considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s the best of which is lo lieh as the atypical student of the martial arts his performance is quite groundbreaking though upon first glance at this movie you wouldn't really know it because of how that particular character arc has been done to death so many times over the years he's quite humble in his acting doing anything he can to persevere over his enemies and not fight them in anger or stoop to their level of stupidity or arrogance also when he suffers his major setback it does make your heart sink a little bit because it's so brutal and you wonder if he's going to recover enough to realize his life long ambition br br five fingers of death is a classic in every sense it's by no means perfect and viewers would be crazy to expect something on the caliber of the godfather of martial arts movies what it does offer you is the ultimate example of eastern hand to hand combat from the time before eastern cinema was a major fixture in the west br br 7 10 br br p s enter the dragon bolo yeung also appears as the mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the film
<START> you can't watch this film for a history lesson this was the first i had heard of the ma barker saga but i could tell almost immediately that the facts were way off and with a little internet research i realized i was of course right ma barker sure as hell isn't the sexy calculating woman the movie portrays her as and apparently did not orchestrate all the bank robbing schemes and murders that her criminal boys carried out br br but don't expect a brilliant crime drama the script and the acting are adequate the gunfights are excessive and mostly unrealistic and there is a very laughable slow motion death scene so why did i give it a 7 out of 10 br br because it was damn entertaining the gunfights are fun to watch but there are some deeper themes that emerge between them the movie has a strong sense of ego intimidation among it's cast of alpha males each of whom has his own agenda and i appreciate the minimal use of swears for the period the set pieces are great reproducing a convincing 1930s era br br so watch this film like you would a cult film and take the excessive bloodiness and ruthlessness in stride with the cheesy ultra serious comments from the fbi man who wants to take the barkers down at any cost don't take it too seriously just have fun with it and if you like this you'll love serial mom
<START> i really tried but this movie just didn't work for me the action scenes were dull the acting was surprisingly poor and some of these characters were too stereotypical to even be funny pam grier tries but when you have nothing to work with even her considerable talent cannot prevent a disaster even by the standards of this weak genre this film is pretty bad
<START> intruder in the dust 1949 dir clarence brown br br production mgm br br excellent tale adapted from the faulkner novel about a black man accused of the murder of a white man who asks a young white boy he has befriended to help him prove his innocence lucas hernandez is something of an anomaly in this small town he's a black man who owns the land he lives on and doesn't think much of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns so when lucas is found holding a gun over the dead body of vinson shot in the back no less young chick claude jarman who lucas once saved after chick fell through the ice while hunting on his land fears that the town finally has the chance to make lucas a n arrested and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is through lucas reaches out to chick for help as the only person he knows not cluttered with notions chick asks his uncle john a lawyer to defend lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the gathering mob to save lucas' life br br the film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing the lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self aware dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the printed page but it has minimal impact on the tone that's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else hernandez who had mostly appeared in oscar micheaux films is superb as the proud lucas porter hall as the murdered man's father in maybe the best role i've ever seen him in and elizabeth patterson as a plucky old lady sympathetic to lucas' case standout in support roles the setting is perfectly realized it is actually filmed in oxford mississippi hometown brown also uses the crowd in an effective way it's always an anonymous mob against a single person like lucas when he's arrested or john when he's going up to his office that is very threatening or the of the whole town gathering at the jailhouse to witness the lynching like it was a parade of note is an absolutely riveting scene when chick and his friend aleck go evidence gathering in a cemetery robert surtees the bad and the beautiful thirty seconds over tokyo ben hur shot the picture br br 1 2 out of 4
<START> sri lanka not a country i've ever given much thought to i have to admit i didn't even know it was near india let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983 it seems that the rebels of the tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island br br mani latest film a peck on the cheek tells the story of a young girl named who is separated from her sri lankan parents by the war and raised by a young indian couple is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child although her adopted parents love her as much as could be and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family br br mani ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film dil se which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story or is it the other way around a peck on the cheek inhabits similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers the central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family and especially that between a child and her adopted parents it's a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others it's an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way br br the film revolves around 9 year old played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress p s in her first and only acting role she's a princess and a monster always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long the young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her br br a peck on the cheek has such an innocent name i was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact i dare say the film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen br br mani direction is superb very confident and mature the most sophisticated work i've seen from this director yet the film is visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork and imagery a r rahman provides the film's soundtrack which is not as good as his classic dil se or bombay music based on first impressions at least but still shows his great musical talent br br i'm not aware of a dvd release for the film yet i saw it in tamil with english subtitles thanks to the san francisco international film festival of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight the production is a truly world class effort and i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure br br recommended
<START> this movie is basically a spoof on hitchcock's strangers on a train which i thought was overrated anyway the plot has danny devito going to see strangers and then thinking billy crystal wants them to swap murders for crystal to murder his mother and devito to murder his wife both devito and crystal are great and so is devito's mother this is devito's directorial debut and it's better than the war of the roses
<START> every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week the dialogs or monologues rather as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing are just becoming so tedious for example the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish i forgot what it was pasta with meatballs perhaps always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into all out war and these were just the few seconds or so br br so it seems every time lots of lines with absolutely zero content the scripts they use must be enormous br br but then every once in a while something happens the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent emotional moments for example this week it was breakdown at the estate agent's i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while br br almost makes everything worthwhile
<START> i'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this yawn fest somewhere given enough time maybe the producers could find it i do not connect with any of the characters this is a problem for a documentary that soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility although because of the poor story flow i'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do the story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on the 3rd founder that takes them for is introduced so late into the film and tom have to fruitlessly to explain oh yeah this guy created the idea too and just when i thought i had a slight grasp on who all the tertiary characters were some crazy woman in ranting about getting a puppy what's up with that also did tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff i can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening actually i think i feel for them
<START> one of the better made for tv biopics i just wish it had told us more i have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters and this movie did what it could based on the constraints placed on it by the family did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life one of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into karen's anorexia in the reading i have done about the disease especially cherry boone o'neill's wonderful book starving for attention anorexia appears to be a disease of control karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life don't get me wrong i believed she truly loved the music but she felt she had little control over her career she truly loved her family but they did not express it well and she didn't know how to make her family understand her the film could have touched so much more on that i treasure the music i have of the carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today
<START> a total and utter travesty of a movie 'dark the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release the script direction acting and action sequence's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent the above reviewer must be related to the director as that's the only reason i can see for his her appraisal of this rubbish some might call it b movie fun or 'so bad it's good' just to excuse there enjoyment of it but when the lead actor and most experienced cast member cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you've got a very very bad movie avoid at all costs
<START> all of the trials and tribulations of making a no budget movie right from the mouths of those involved you feel all of the sweat guts determination and dedication put into this labor of love and the frustration of being left hanging after all his work the clips of interviews with all involved provides a great flowing narrative and conveys the balls out hardcore punk almost anarchic attitude it took to film waldo and subsequently the documentary and company deserve all the props in the world for not giving up when the going got tough and getting a texas tale of treason out so we can see what it's like for the budding filmmaker on the street
<START> the danish bladerunner is boldly stated on the box are you kidding me this film is a complete drag when i'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen i usually pause the vcr so i won't miss anything not this time i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge just so i wouldn't have to go back why the hell is there not one scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work it's one of the premises of film is that our hero who's a hacker has a little to help him the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future when he loses the assistant in the movie he's helpless and can't get into any computers he's a hacker it's like saying that you can't drive your car if you don't have your lucky driving cap on i won't even go into the lightning effect when he recieves electroshock
<START> ugh stephen baldwin i never noticed until i got the dvd home and saw his name in the credits double ugh what's worse he's the name in this low budget mindless wandering wannabe shoot'em up i mean where did they find the guy to write this refuse driving a caterpillar in the la city dump while hoping to break into the movie game the whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on ridiculous premise baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for american gothic sans pitchfork his whole acting repertoire is looking like he needs the potty and then looking like he found it br br so there you have it folks bad script bad acting by no name actors low budget setting and a hero that's about as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an action hero it's too late for me to get my money back on the dvd but you can spare yourself unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh frankly this one is too boring to be funny
<START> last time i checked in here i think there was no more than one comment i'm very glad that more people have caught on this flick now and even more so about you all digging it as well i caught this the night of christmas 2004 and i found myself unable to change the channel on my tv even though it was an asian flick and i'm sadly but truly very used not to give any chance to any off hollywood products i did that night though and i thank god deeply for it i've not been able to shake that movie out of my system since not that i've tried to or wanted to and it still amazes me in an extremely grateful way that such a great beautiful experience came in such a way completely unexpected like a christmas miracle please if you got the chance go see this movie buy it or rent it of bootleg it or whatever but watch it i guarantee it will affect you i'm out of time but i'm far from finished with my here so ill be back as soon as i can
