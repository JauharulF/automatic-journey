<START> one of the problems with popular culture especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s is that mass media especially television is usually about four years behind 'underground' media primarily music many people think the generation remained important throughout the 1970s actually it was all over at altamont in 1970 by 1972 'underground' rock or the had moved east to england and led black sabbath and david bowie early metal heads and the so called rockers ' who were all 'peace and love' not neither in a darkly different vein was charles manson's 'family ' br br this obvious pilot for a television show that thankfully was never picked up by the networks is attempting to come to terms with a culture that was already as withered as yesterday's flowers the script must have been lying around a few years by the time it was produced writer had already achieved recognition for tough mafia revenge tales and the cultural references are all to easy rider and woodstock 1969 the music referenced on the soundtrack is actually earlier 1966 67 at woodstock hendrix canned heat and sly and the family stone had blasted this kind of folk pop into oblivion br br the movie is about a middle class family that goes on the road in order to meet hippies wow man it's a groovy mind blowing happening of a bag however politics count for nothing vietnam some place in asia right br br this average meaning stale and vacuous tv movie is only redeemed by jeff bridges' surprisingly mature performance as the young college drop out who convinces his parents and grandma to hippie america all the rest of the performances are standard tv fair by standard tv actors of the time the director avails himself of some nice location cinematography but otherwise the film is a poor way to spend 90 minutes br br i knew it was all over when sal remarks of a young runaway who tells the other characters they are not really there she's a latent existentialist wow far out groovy br br a couple extra points for being 'so bad it's funny ' but if you don't care about the '70's tv version of the '60's stay away
<START> if you really loved gwtw you will find quite disappointing the story those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett but let me say that considering the novel nothing good could came out of this br br i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs mitchell did for the film it took me some time to understand how good the ending was scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett since she always got what she wanted but there was no kiss in the end br br then alexandra ripley came to fix this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be and of course describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else nothing could have been further from mrs mitchell mind i am sure br br the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending br br if margaret mitchell could came to live again she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw br br sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault isn't it is it any good if i don't compare it to the original maybe sorry to say i don't really care br br i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's suberb work otherwise don't even try
<START> this production was quite a surprise for me i absolutely love obscure early 30s movies but i wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story if by any chance you're not convinced in the first half hang in there for the finale of course you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical a fascinating viewing experience but i think the cat's paw is not available on video dvd yet watch your pbs listings
<START> the italian job is a caper movie done by the numbers riding on the back of every caper cliche it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month br br the biggest problem is that the italian job possesses no imagination at all i've seen it all before and done better then the acting is fine the cinematography is completely acceptable but this film breaks absolutely no new ground br br let's tick off the cliches br br old school criminal father figure and his protege br br another gang member jealous of protege br br a double cross br br only bad guys use guns while good guy criminals don't have to br br good criminals always outwit the bad guys br br and that's about the first fifteen minutes everything is so predictable even the heist and car chase scenes supposedly the highlight of the movie seem pretty ordinary this is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so i already knew what to look for br br for me a caper film works only if it has an element of realism that maybe just maybe it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or just because moments parts of the italian job just throws that out the window with computers doing things that computers can't do the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving especially going down the stairs and not one single police car responding to street explosions recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response br br the acting is passable with the crew seth green jason stratham and mos def being at least fun to watch mark wahlberg is just too smarmy as the nice guy hero while charlize theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range donald sutherland is a class act as always and shows up wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together br br overall this is a pretty uninteresting film given the imdb ratings it's the girls that really love this film which i can understand to some extent but there are such better caper films out there even the vapidness of the recent ocean's eleven outshines the non event that is the italian job br br spoiler br br at the conclusion take a moment to think about what is going to happen to norton's character are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise especially since it would appear to be long and painful he didn't deserve that simpering creep that he was br br end spoiler
<START> in a time of predictable movies in which abound violence cheap romance and melodrama it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange movie the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent especially alan rickman if you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions a movie that will surprise you in good or bad dark for you and if you're not convinced believe me that alan performance is well worth it especially at the end ladies
<START> to be honest i've never been to the congo or even africa and after watching the made for television movie heart of darkness i do not think i'd want to the movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible though the book was not the best i have read after watching the movie i seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more nicolas roeg the director of the movie did a horrible job portraying joseph conrad's novella into a movie i give roeg some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie but this may not have been the job for him the movie was unsuccessful to express any part of the novella other than the basics of the plot the set and scenery also lacked the beauty conrad portrayed of africa in the book in the book marlow had seen so many great wonders but in the movie you did not get that same experience no i'm not blaming everything on the director the acting in the film was just terrible all of the actors were dull and uninteresting throughout the whole movie i felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions as if they were reading from the script the entire time tim roth who plays marlow did not portray marlow's sense of adventure for his journey into the congo well marlow's journey to find kurtz was supposed to but i didn't experience that in the movie i would not recommend watching this movie especially if you have read the book already it does not come close to doing justice for joseph conrad's novella conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with marlow on his quest to find mr kurtz where as the film did not a great novella but a very poor film heart of darkness the movie is based on the book written by joseph conrad also called heart of darkness
<START> over all it was a real good movie though all the actors besides jones sucked by the time i was half was through it i was really getting tired of seeing only change i would have made to it would to have more flash backs possibly with the real cobb
<START> everything about this movie is awful br br you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible you can't however gauge how bad it's going to be br br we start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like doesn't provoke the slightest emotion br br what then starts seems to be one of two separate stories the first half of the movie consists of the going around competing in paid midnight fights with other ethnic groups the always win of course because they apparently lift weights and have respect it is in these scenes that we first get to see the degree of bad acting editing scripting and hatred for the people who funded this film br br eventually the main character and his mate get sent to prison the entire prison part of the movie is unrelated to what i assume is the plot and consists of a bunch of fights br br once out of prison 3 years for murder the main character and his mate reunite with the they then go to the other side of town and try to lay low because apparently everyone wants to kill them br br soon the get set up for the rape of another gang members girl and run around town fighting off hordes of different gangs this point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game as the simply run around and fight off enemies who seemingly get worse and worse as the movie goes on br br anyway the movie ends with some massive climatic fight scene in which the remaining the two main characters take on every gang they've fought so far apparently the other gangs don't have a problem uniting to take on the remaining the skinheads don't mind asians after about a million more people get beaten up by the invincible brothers the movie ends with the main characters heading home they don't make it home however because they are burned to death by the the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere br br this movie may be more like a computer game then a movie because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches to the face from a million different people who the majority of the time are twice their size br br there are also tonnes more stupid unexplainable events in this movie such as an asian fighting off his own gang and taking a katana to the head just to let the get away br br like someone else mentioned this movie isn't so bad its funny it's just so bad
<START> jonathan demme is such a character oriented director that to see him pulling a brian de palma which is to say aping hitchcock it is nearly predictable when he fails to work up much suspense within this tepid mystery working from a screenplay by david from murray bloom's novel demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between alan j pakula's paranoia dramas and hitchcock's dangling thrillers roy scheider stars as a retired secret agent mourning the murder of his wife who is now busy dodging bad guys who are out to kill him takes off right away but the script is full of flimsy threads and any excitement dies out quickly there's a visually impressive climax at falls but demme gets little out of his cast and even less out of this bummer of a story from
<START> meltdown is pretty interesting sci fi no major budget very few special effects but decent acting and a storyline of global doom is enough to sustain viewing an asteroid the atmosphere and thrust the earth into an orbit closer to the sun global warming rapidly becomes unbearable a determined lapd cop casper van dien goes all out to save the world from certain annihilation as the rising temps are devastating the pressure is on to save mankind from this solar catastrophe as well as protect his daughter nurse ex wife and tv reporter girlfriend the cast includes stefanie von venus amanda crew and vincent gale
<START> some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everybody two months later some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the sub to retrieve their cargo after finding 200 dead bodies the marine commander tells the doctor i need to know if there's anything down here that could be a danger to my men uh gee ya think she refuses to tell him what is down there citing need to know yup that pretty well sizes it up one of the scientists is apparently some sort of idiot savant real heavy on the idiot light on the savant he's given the task of fixing the lights he finds the control panel for the lights cuts a wire and shrieks like a banshee then he does it again then he takes a hammer and smashes the control panel to pieces which causes all the lights on the submarine to start working br br and so it goes apparently this was made in sweden i'm not sure if the swedes have a really weird sense of humor or if they're just really awful movie makers i'm inclined to think they're awful movie makers if you guessed that there's a huge explosion at the end of this thing well sorry but that's on a need to know basis so i can't tell you br br if you've absolutely got to see a giant scorpion movie let me suggest tail sting which is a cheesy and fun movie about scorpions on a plane or bugs which is a fairly descent b movie about scorpions in a tunnel look at this movie as an absolute last resort oh it's watchable it's hard to turn it off just because of the sheer lunacy of it but that's about all it's got going for it
<START> the worst movie i've seen in years and i've seen a lot of movies acting is terrible there is no plot whatsoever there is no point whatsoever i felt robbed after i rented this movie they recommended it to me mind you a disgrace for terrible movies stay away from this terrible piece of c p save your money
<START> the scarlet coat is about arnold betraying his country but he really isn't in the movie too much the main focus is on major cornell wilde and major andre micheal wilding wilding steals the movie as a officer and a gentlemen also as a to as tries to uncover who is the man leaking to the british wilde has to deal with the british the dr o dell george sanders who watches his every move and love anne francis this is a very enjoyable movie
<START> everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'the prey' endless nature footage bad acting aside from these elements this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases is considered a cult classic br br jackson bostwick and jackie coogan play pretty well off each other there's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off skill behind the instrument not too bad if i do say so myself br br the last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace the ending still haunts me to this day this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl does the special effects some may know him from films like and 'friday the 13th part 7 he directed both these films all in all this isn't a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact on a hollywood level this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts but for that handful yet very loyal of slasher movie fans in the world even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven
<START> a review i have put off for far too long br br bluntly 2001 is one of the best science fiction films made to date if not the very best stanley kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works and although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and i'll have to agree back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since it was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why the film still looks marvelous after almost forty years take note cgi people through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid this aspect alone almost single handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects i can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space like it is in reality not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly br br aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film the music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler br br the story while seemingly simple is profound sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film what are they where did they come from what do they do these are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way while most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions it's not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is experience it for more clarification the end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution br br while it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man it's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film faster paced feature those with short attention spans need not apply br br last but not least is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist hal 9000 the computer never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue another sign of kubrick's genius br br all in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made a personal favorite everyone must see this film at least once br br very highly recommended
