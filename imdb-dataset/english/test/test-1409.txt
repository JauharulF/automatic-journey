<START> i thought this was very different compared to most modern interpretations of shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly it would not be useful for those studying it at school etc as it does not show the traditional shakespeare character interpretations i e miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional shakespeare lady but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch it does not include also the correct format as in the layout of acts and scenes as i am currently playing miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and i would definitely recommend it as a must see even if just to say you've seen it shakespeare fans would love this
<START> this movie is so bad it's worth seeing this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast however they know it's been done before many times so to make it different let's do it very badly major masters has his name pirated from 80's movie to live and die in l a from character played by willem dafoe that saved 10 minutes in writing and production time the plane is supposed to be a 747 that plane has a unique silhouette even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top just ask the late ronald reagan who lamented this point when them shot down kal 007 in the eighties yet when the plane takes off it's clearly not a 747 looks more like a this well researched film also forgets to include the seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane heroine is played by perpetually pouting gloria lynn berg after tying up the hijacker despite several bus loads of people on this jumbo jet nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them he's just forced to amuse himself br br the crippled plane leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans won't make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island only the 300 feet too short four army guys with little the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes no need for a bulldozer here where can you find guys like this these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons a compass and a duck br br after that hellish obstacle is fixed masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i can't tell you but can you say moby dick br br there are so many retarded scenes in this movie the wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while masters who supposedly can barely fly puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20 000 feet per minute drops the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts but doesn't budge an inch br br i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts this moving could have been way better if we need a pouting heroine in the movie why not pick better known actress bernadette peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well besides she can sing and the busty well aging peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking let's land the plane movie musical cast luciano pavarotti as the pilot they can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there's no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird in keeping with the musical theme masters could then be played by andrei that peters can sing with as he lands the plane not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english now that's a plot think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters and the air traffic controller br br atc sir please throttle back to 180 flaps set to 25 degrees maintain heading br br what br br atc sir arm spoilers now confirm brake pressure at 250 maintain descent at 500 br br what br br the hijacker could have been played by the late great rodney dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded i get no respect my wife is into group sex yeah she screwed me in front of the judge and jury get the idea br br missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues she said i was great in bed i told her i practice myself a lot now this is a movie br br also according to similar movie executive decision where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance have massive up top the plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there my uncle has old clothes a sled magazines and all sorts of stuff in his wouldn't it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed chevy chase in a woman's watching old super 8 movies of his childhood just a recommendation br br so give it a chance and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it
<START> this movie was so bad it looked like a home movie in one scene the camera very slowly and gradually tilts down then moves back up into place again the sound is and occasionally fades out then in again in another scene the camera man is just visible in a mirror br br then came the scene with instructions how to put down a tent which believe me went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either in my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer even with these scenes added it was very short br br the only good thing about it was the severed head which did look quite realistic
<START> how can anyone dare say anything bad about this film pardon mel brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it br br the first time i saw this i cried from laughing so hard everything about it is funny br br while robin hood men in tights is not my favorite comedy that spot is taken by real genius it ranks way up there in my book so go see it if you don't spend the whole time laughing then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over cary elwes
<START> i just watched this an early harold lloyd short film that featured his glasses character on kino video's dvd of the harold lloyd collection he's actually a con man with snub pollard as his partner who gets discovered by bebe daniels who herself performs fake what she discovers is that lloyd and pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are lost i'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and snub enter the place bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like snub trying one of outfits not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny so on that note i recommend are crooks dishonest
<START> this new movie by is awesome check it out and you'll be amazed the story of emily waters once a girl from a broken home whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away the music is incredible as well it really the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict directed by jesse and animated by erica starring the beautiful marissa with music by nico rowland daniel collins jeff matt and support this film and support he is a very talented guy go see his film shades of grey as well
<START> since the plot like vertigo or brian depalma's obsession till to the score by peter chase that reminds the sounds of bernard herrmann this little pearl seems to be sight from fews remarkable playing by and vincent cassel in a bohemian paris portrayed from the famous thierry a little cult it is a pity that the only version available on dvd are the french one and the english directed by a controversial artist as gilles it could be considered a little homage to the cinema masterworks it is a french movie and as all of them not for all we could say a cinema even if not so publicized it could be remembered for several reason
<START> overrated poorly written badly acted did the academy even watch this i guess not the political content guaranteed it an oscar nomination indo pak border a little boy terrorism anything with the word terrorist gets attention in br br this post 9 11 world its like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an oscar nomination irrespective of their merits br br and please cinematography does not mean shooting landscapes which are pretty in the first place you have to be a rotten shooter to screw up making the desert pretty at least this didn't win the oscar they got that right at least would have been a travesty
<START> house of dracula is a good sequel to house of frankenstein there isn't as much action but the acting is just as good onslow stevens is the benevolent doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from dracula via a transfusion dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his affliction but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then his blood into the doctor it turns out that dracula really didn't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse dracula is destroyed and the wolf man is next in line for a cure which is successful in the meantime frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death don't worry the same trio came back in abbott and costello meet frankenstein john carradine again plays a sinister dracula baron is his alias at the start of the film and in house of frankenstein lon chaney is the sympathetic wolf man and glenn strange returns as the frankenstein monster lionel atwill again plays an inspector which he often does in the universal studios monster films a keeper for your collection
<START> this movie over does it on the cgi i mean sci fi really they over did it the original '' is better it does not use cgi like the sequel in this movie its the simple people running from mutated killer bats and really bats in afghanistan the plot involves u s army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by bats and dying but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers the acting is bad and this doesn't even look like a horror movie in all this movie is a fairly good tv movie for sci fi channel but if like sci fi's movies you'll like this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie don't be surprised oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead
<START> i must admit i wasn't expecting much on this movie i was surprised i truly enjoyed it as much as i did the script wasn't oscar material but it wasn't horrible either the acting was great by mark wahlberg jennifer aniston had a great supporting role and looked lovely as ever what made this movie for me was the music if you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands then you probably wont like this movie its all about being a rockstar some cliche's were present but didn't bring down the movie at all i would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to stand up and shout 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music br br jason
<START> great music great dancing a sexy star swayze and actual sexual desire shown by a female character a very unusual event you rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change i also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager coping with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality of course it is sappy at moments it is after all a movie musical but all in all it is a real pleasure a fun romance and also politically enlightened this movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines i carried the watermelon
<START> thunderbolt is probably jackie chan's worst movie since the protector in 1985 yes i know that nobody watches his movies for their stories but the plotting of this one is unusually lame even by his standards and while the fight choreography is up to his standards the fight scenes the whole two of them are ruined as others have mentioned by the frenetic distracting camerawork even the most serious jackie chan fans shouldn't really bother with this offensively haphazard stunt and plug filled garbage anita yuen's cute and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues for a good serious jackie movie i recommend crime story 1 2
<START> this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner something which sets it apart from most films with this plot mr lam jacky cheung has a relationship with choy lam who was also so good in koma in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation he is married for 20 years to ching the great anita in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us and it appears to be a loving relationship when ching offers to care for hers and mr lam's former teacher choy and mr lam have the opportunity to be together what makes the film so good is director ann pacing it takes a while to uncover the secrets of the and it all makes sense the movie is very dramatic and touching you don't feel any repulsion about the teacher student situation something that elevates this film above many with the same plot it is slow moving but stay with it also revel in ms wonderful unglamorous but beautiful performance she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her
<START> br br spoilers br br i'm going to be as kind as i can about this film some people including directors can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind so br br there is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and that's it everything else bites the big one all the acting is appalling the script is embarrassing the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers all in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendencies br br as a horror film it's not very scary and if it supposed to a thinking man's horror film well it succeeded on some level i kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away it may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and i'm missing the point but i somehow doubt it br br this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly await the resurrection of british horror br br if you don't agree with this review that fine it's just my own opinion and i'm sure someone out there will love it the director's mum for instance
