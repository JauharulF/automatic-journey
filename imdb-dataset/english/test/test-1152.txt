<START> this is one of those films with a great potential brilliant actors a debut from a very interesting director and a haunting survivor ish plot br br but it does not work at all br br to start with the good thing the cinematography is stunning the beauty of the desert shows itself as a merciless surrounding also in the pictures and then there is the acting quite allright jennifer jason leigh has never been better bruce davison also seems to have developed his character from altman's short cuts br br then the disappointments janet mcteer and the plot why on earth does pick lear for their play the whole idea of letting shakespeare articulate their despair and inner longings does not work it seems like a facade and it is clear that the tragedies takes place because of the choice of lear they just needs to fit in in the script by and academy award winner anders thomas jensen br br and the sex it takes about three days then more or less all of the characters are sexually frustrated sex is always the easy way out when you are in need of a crisis in a plot janet mcteer's part totally falls apart mainly because of that ridiculous idea the sex makes the plot fall promptly to the ground instead they could have focused on the dialogue there must have been conversation between all of the characters but we mainly see them talking in smaller groups their talking though is as dead as lear and the rest of the film br br the king is alive still is not the worst danish dogme '95 movie yet but comparing it to the most recent of the homegrown dogme '95 films for by lone this one fails badly it is not a good film it is a bad one but it is beautiful
<START> man are you serious did you read the book or watch this movie well if you did let me warn you it is bogus mark has been seeking a job since losing his job with the lapd you remember him don't you he was the guy that lied on the stand and gave the oj simpson defense a foothold they were looking for well he has written three books since then i have read all three of them no i am not a fan they were given to me however i will tell you one similarity in all three they grossly distort the importance of mark he shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three in murder in spokane he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer when he had nothing to do with it in all books he takes great delight in running down local law enforcement efforts kind of like his efforts were run down in the oj trial in this movie there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at and lusting after him many other shots have him at the center of attention when in reality i am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was hey isn't that the racist that caused oj to get off this was an interesting real life story but not a good movie over it
<START> if you like movies that will make you think this is absolutely one of the good ones i always liked david lynch and cronenberg they have always made high quality movies br br has directed k pax brilliantly the movie tears in feelings and philosophy of the mind and world kevin spacey and jeff bridges both delivers superb acting skills it caught me i did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie on the other hand if you are hoping for a special effect sci fi movie this is not for you the story is being dragged a bit which can be a bit boring but also works as a way of building up the theme of the movie br br enjoy this film i did
<START> the film is visually stunning from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove through the street and the run down garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film it also has a wonderful sense of time both 1950's the film's opening and 1960's all of the performances are top class especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son what a pity then that the story is so ridiculous for a start in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel and his family it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community in the church we see five or six of the main characters at the front and another two or three at the back but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins they show no sign of hearing him heeding him or dissenting from him at the cockfight nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains secondly which isn't actually a town but a tiny village seems to lack some essential services such as police and fire service murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema for that matter everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat fields and most puzzling of all for a 'typical' north of ireland setting there is only one christian community not even a couple of to season the mix even if you're willing to suspend disbelief the story itself is pretty threadbare a pale imitation of an a j melodrama and the music well it's beautiful for the first two minutes but when the same four chords are repeated non stop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating my advice watch this with the sound off
<START> one of the worst movies i've seen this year everything about the film screams amateur for a movie set in the 1800's everybody speaks like it's the 1990's the acting particularly the people playing the white slave masters is horrible after about an hour into this movie i walked out what a waste of time and effort for a much better film on this subject see steven spielberg's far superior amistad
<START> this movie is amazing you will never laugh harder it's a target no i think it's yes it's a boob this movie gets funnier by the second like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene this movie is like congrats if you buy or rent this you'll never return it in my opinion i didn't and i haven't found it in a store since i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung fu action flicks if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value good or even mediocre acting and good special effects this is not that movie if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go with friends popcorn and drinks it's the perfect evening
<START> the essential message one which miller would have surely intended after seeing vichy war crimes trials is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life meat loaf's character fred has known lawrence for many years and yet when the time comes at the bidding of his fanatical supporters he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their target group for me this is the crucial message it doesn't matter what lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards they are marked and have chance to save themselves by using reason animal aggression and anger have blinded fred's union thugs to reality br br a friend of mine suggested i should see the wave to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it i once conducted an experiment in a role playing game and was shocked to see how normal and level headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state which would ultimate threaten them all because it crept in in stages br br fred is the start his la friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong br br the relationship between lawrence and the jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one because lawrence misses the point almost until the end if the bigots force out where is he to go if his family have fled the nazis what an irony to be tormented again in the land of freedom br br that big poster it's a fairly famous propaganda piece about american families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail when you see this film watch for the grafitti on the subway train and all the little posters the message lurks there too br br this movie should be on the curriculum of every school especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by reasonable people who are just extremists in thin disguises
<START> police squad 1982 was a funny show that ended too soon but i guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many american television shows the geniuses behind this funny show were the team of zucker abrahams and zucker every since his straight act in the comedy hit airplane leslie nielsen has found a new career as a comedian in this short lived t v series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more the bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending but lt leslie nielsen got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believed br br tooo bad they never released this on d v d if a show needed to be re released it would have to be this one a whole new generation is waiting to see this show br br highly recommended
<START> the stunts sequences as well as the special effects are brilliant in this movie michael must be one of best stunt co of all time the explosion in the cafÃ© is a wonderful combination of stunts special effects and visual effects the director had an idea that the crew managed to create on film br br besides that donald sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film
<START> this came as a huge surprise for me i had never heard of this movie when i first saw it and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terrorist hostage situation at a high school toy soldiers has the best from it's time period of the early 90's where action movies were light hearted and very enjoyable the action is good the plot is interesting and way over the top the bad guy is a one dimensional hateful douchebag which is great louis gossett jr is in it it's simply a feel good movie which i thoroughly enjoyed br br you can't go wrong with this one if you like action i give it a solid rating of 8 10
<START> this movie is truly unbelievable in every sense of the word i couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing and i didn't believe it anyhow hepburn is probably my favorite actress but this was ridiculous being a hillbilly myself i know what it should sound like and it's not kate's back bay accent the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times sydney toler was cast as another one of the hillbillies with accent to match maybe this was a practical joke come to think of it i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting well maybe this i noticed that natalie schaefer lovey howell on gilligan's island appeared in this play on broadway can you imagine what part she might have played
<START> x m should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons br br 1 it is one the first and the few movies not to have a happy ending doubtless the effect was more profound in post world war ii america than it would be today but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message br br 2 it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion using space as a valid setting for drama the lack of scientific background notwithstanding the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare it's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space br br 3 the anti nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers men or animal the effect of martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending br br sterno says take a ride on x m
<START> this film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt a triumph in the post war period it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema recently it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even handed representation of soldiers' integration into post war life ever made and that most definitely includes films such as the deer hunter i like it but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes br br the tale is a simple one three very different servicemen who have mustered out after world war ii the big one fly home to their midwest town and try to resume or create civilian lives one has a disability one has a cushy job waiting for him and the other has nothing to go on but determination br br there are some good but unfortunately uneven performances march won the best actor oscar for playing an old sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank personally i think jimmy stewart deserved it for it's a wonderful life which also deserved the best picture award but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post war audience as i said it was fashionable march has one fantastic scene a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real wwii hero pappy and otherwise is solid but unspectacular br br i am going against the grain here but i thought that myrna loy who played march's wife was justly ignored by the academy i detected barely a hint of warmth from her in fact i kept thinking she was going to slap frederic march for annoying her she practically every time they were together something was definitely missing there in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than i think all this nonsense about her being the perfect wife is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal you may disagree with that but the academy voters apparently did not she is a major problem with this film terribly miscast br br dana andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero then winds up behind the counter again is amazing he is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons and his future looks bleak but then he chances upon march's daughter peggy teresa wright in a fantastic turn and fireworks explode both are great but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film some moments of pure soap opera intrude punctuated by the all time classic line i'm going to bust that marriage up the romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return br br speaking of uplifting now we come to harold russell he has a naturalistic quality to his acting or is it non acting that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then taking a no nonsense approach to his situation he is an inspiration his best scene one of the best in all cinema is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition i'm lucky i still have my elbows unlike some of the boys truly great stuff br br the film has some moments that soar it also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points
<START> this movie was a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale i'm a huge burt reynolds fan but even he was horrible in this film the only redeeming quality of this film was the chick that smoked all the time she was kind of attractive to look at otherwise what a waste of time and energy
<START> if you want a film with the full range of emotion look no further dramatic and funny and scenes of wrenching emotion i can safely guarantee very few will be able to view this warm and very human film without shedding a tear now and then the acting by the two leads is hard to believe you would swear the two young men really do suffer from muscular dystrophy rory and cerebral palsy michael quite simply two of the finest performances i have ever seen these are two very believable characters as well and you never have the feeling things have just been tossed in for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy in the dvd release as extras they have deleted scenes including an alternate ending and an extended party sequence why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in no way superfluous but without reservation i can heartily recommend this film to anyone one of the very best i have ever seen
