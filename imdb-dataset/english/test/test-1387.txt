<START> awful star wars knock off with a slightly more comic tinge robert urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery he hooks up with mary crosby daughter around 25 and a total cutie a princess looking for her missing father also in the cast are an embarrassed looking anjelica huston in some hilarious sci fi get ups and a pudgy short ish ron perlman whom i thought was seven feet tall from his other roles and john carradine who looks days from death and hollywood squares relative term bruce if you ever wanted to see bruce get decapitated here's your film but then again even that's not worth seeing as it doesn't shut him up at all think he might have been a robot but i nodded off a couple of times
<START> forget samara and jason br br horror has a new name granny the plot is simple but efficient the actors are good two thumbs up for michelle and the killer and the dialogs are even quite clever from the beginning to the end the action will leave you breathless you just can't escape it there is blood awful murders funny moments and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule deja vu surely not granny is not another slash movie it's truly a classic of its own it deserves the success it had and there's even more success to come with its re release congrats
<START> everyone is entitled to an opinion the only critic who counts is yourself i think this is a great movie much better than the original br br in caddyshack rodney dangerfield is funny but obnoxious he was asked to do the sequel but things got in the way jackie mason shows the saying that less is more he is funny but a man with real family issues a more rounded person it's no drama but a movie that makes you feel actually in some points you feel sorry for jackie mason especially when his daughter walks out on him br br it has a good soundtrack and overall a good sorry a good end to the series br br in the tv show alf alf says that he cried in terms of endearment the wife kate tanner played by anne also says he cried at caddyshack 2
<START> it is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change as an added bonus it is nice to see some local home boys from massachusetts making good in l a i hope this show will be a keeper
<START> this had the promise of being an interesting film the subject matter was certainly a promising one the excesses of the catholic church during the counter however not only was this not developed other than a two paragraph introduction many things were not explained i e the gypsies the the and their relationship to the one true church nor were the politics of the time explained i e the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor though these may have been apparent to an austrian audience the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americans br br but perhaps it's a good thing that they didn't emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway instruments of torture bloody executions witch and heretic burnings big shiny swords and pretty golden are the stars of the film it could have just as easily been one of those conan type sword and sorcery movies only with period costumes
<START> the premise of the story is common enough average family wants out of the rat race wants to find the simple life so they move from sherman oaks california to lake kids in tow br br the lake is beautiful they have leased an old house but wait there may be something in the lake people are being murdered and no one knows how never mind why gerald mcraney is excellent a familiar face for lifetime viewers valerie harper is also good since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel br br you will also enjoy barry corbin as the town eccentric and darryl anderson as a bruce dern lookalike crazed military man br br while the story plot is a bit over the top if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from psycho deliverance as well as other horror stories of that genre several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu br br sit back and enjoy if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining and better than for example the more recent movie br br i know what you did last summer it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's
<START> christopher nolan had his goals set on following in a very narrow direction and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'poverty row' movies the likes of directed back in the 40s only this time he's able to implement touches of homage things like black and white photography a given due to the shoe string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit and casting of the actors the john doe lead the slick male counterpart and the beautiful in a gritty way femme fatale while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible that and as well in the film noir mood nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot maybe even more so than memento where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch here the non linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like bill can go through as dark a path as cobb only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games cobb is br br of course the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story and going into it i wasn't even sure where it would lead if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala slacker where nolan would lead his character along to one urban british person to another but the establishment of the ties of bill to cobb are done in a quick and excellent way as we see right when cobb approaches bill at the cafÃ© to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both that and the first robbery he brings him along for what seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set up by cobb and his lady just called 'the maybe a too obvious homage to noir but why but this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how the density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters with alex haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary and with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this russell almost makes it too easy even with a face that would send ana savage shaking her head br br meanwhile nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense with the fade in fade outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression but enough to add to the 'this could lead logic of the script he follows it in hand held form as if he knows where his limitations lie and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials close ups when need be one i loved is russell's face in a small mirror and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts sometimes as mentioned the line between seeing something in day' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low level criminals with mind games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way simply put this is one of the great calling cards i've seen from a filmmaker in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid editing and big gun firing dogs of the mainstream even in independent films it's a bright little 71 minutes
<START> i happened to see a promo for this movie on spike channel last night it was grouped with a patrick rerun of another movie he made and thought was in this sequel boy was i wrong i see the screen writer also starred in it and i'm thinking the budget was a bit tight i am surprised to see will patton in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a c movie like this jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his father one of the best bad guy actors ever that failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie was the chicks good looking and with lots of t a just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
<START> lackawanna blues is and excellent movie the casting was perfect every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played their chemistry together was amazing the acting was superb i felt as if i knew the characters i could almost 'feel' them they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's oh the memories my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see i have watched this movie so many times that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them i can't even list my favorite part because i have so many favorite parts thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age and that is black people loving each other looking out for each other respecting each other caring about each other and doing all we can to help each other gotta go now i have to go watch it again
<START> 22 joe drama 1970 joe peter boyle is a racist factory worker who's known to hate hippies and ni ers he meets bill a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addict young daughter jill susan sarandon jill runs away and joins a hippie commune at the outskirts of town bill turns to joe for help their search leads them through the seediest parts of town where both men's inner hatred and loath is furthered tested br br critique this was director john g first sleeper turned smash hit an amazing run which included 'the karate kid' 'split 'weekend at bernie's' film is interesting enough in that it served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s vietnam war black power women's lib etc it also has a good performance from peter boyle as joe one of the cinema's first antiheroes he's always been good at playing creepy bossy heavies whose abstract ideas are enforced by his intimidating presence he would play the frankenstein monster in mel brook's spoof young frankenstein he reminds me of a little kid trapped in a big dumb awkward body film has a weak script the meeting of joe and bill for instance is a bit coincidental but it has a particularly gruesome post taxi driver ending br br quote title song i saw a fella selling junk to children he gets nervous every time i pass cause he knows that if i catch him i'm gonna kick his head and kick his fat a
<START> the first robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a sick sense of violence it was a fine line to walk but paul verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well they made a sequel how awful possible spoilers ahead though anything that could spoil this is beyond me br br irvin kershner is not the director for this type of film he clearly did not understand the wit of the original and as a result the massive over the top senseless violence looks really bad and worse is very distasteful even worse is the musical score leonard rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic light music does not match the images on the screen at all what was he scoring the great american hero worst of all he completely eliminated theme from the first film which was so memorable and perfect can you imagine a superman film without john williams' fanfare or indiana jones etc how could he do that br br the plot is just a collection of ideas that don't gel in beginning we see robo stalking his old wife fine good idea but they completely drop it after that then there is this a stupid idea of the company robo to be nice that's thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped or the silly idea that the repulsive 10 year old drug lord reminds robo of his son once again a weak motif that is shown briefly twice and dropped this may work in a comic book but not on film and frank miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink it doesn't work as a whole br br some people here seem to be praising the corporate bashing in this film and the privatization of the police that is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first however in the original the old man was a tough business man out for a profit but ultimately fair in the end in this film he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power you can't just change characters like that for no reason and nancy allen's character is useless in this film whereas in the first she was essential to search for himself she is as gratuitous as the violence in this film br br and the violence yes the violence i enjoy many violent bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story irvin kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits shot to pieces children lusting for death and torture and peoples' desire for drugs he doesn't know when to stop do we really need to see every last innocent bystander even people trying to help others get shot up it is inferred when we see the bad robocop shooting repeatedly instead mr kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film br br no this film isn't meant to be message y and i certainly don't watch robocop movies or alien or predator movies for that reason however when you go too far and cross the line much of what you do must be put into question and as for this film in the words of the evil kid drug dealer's last words as he dies it still sucks
<START> man stop making sequels to great movies the original was a great movie that was over the top with fights sex and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 90's the story is believable as if your been to bars in the outs of the south you would know but here comes this piece of junk roadhouse 2 last call lets just hope they are serious with the title and never make another roadhouse ever again it doesn't have the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really believable the story is more of a steven segal type action that even though roadhouse 2 is a b movie it still doesn't click as some b movie action still sales the movie no matter how cheesy it is the only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out the one question is left from the original roadhouse patrick swayze's character dalton is dalton his first name or last name well i'll save you the 4 00 rental fee dalton is his first name as in dalton tanner never make another roadhouse
<START> for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film like why does he show spaceships docking for like 15 minutes here's a word you might want to think about br br beauty br br beauty is an under rated concept sure you'll often see nice photography and so on in films but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it there is a weird belief among that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed this is depressing hogwash there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot a director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so br br requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films it requires you to relax it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization don't get me wrong plots and characters are good but they're not the be all and end all of everything there are different kinds of film and to enjoy you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty pure beauty unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films br br all art is quite useless oscar wilde
<START> this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell and did so really awful jumble of unlikely unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line all without character or clear motivation br br we get clichÃ© snapshots instead of characters one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss who projects an overdone tough guy persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase as in the smallest from a complete american set in a bright sky blue without explanation or apology otherwise it's standard visually one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in ct
<START> there are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in paris his ex hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy he falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently when wendy's brother wendy is one of the room mates comes from england the film starts to become a lot funnier well anyway xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and will change his life forever overall a very nice nostalgic film which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast i thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun i gave it a 9 out of 10 because i left the theatre with a smile on my face and thinking about things i haven't done yet while i'm still in college and would want to do before it's too late
