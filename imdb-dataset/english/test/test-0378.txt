<START> the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the is identical to carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult the similarities to the carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep then the plot went down hill from there would have been nice if a different plot had been devised rather then cloning the earlier movies the raptor movie should have taken lesson from park series in various plots the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex the repeated scenes as if taken from the carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies
<START> ken harrison a young sculptor in his early thirties is seriously injured in a road accident end of story br br end of story that is in the sense of end of any physical action not in the sense of end of the film ken's life is saved but he is paralysed from the neck down when he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive the rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die br br ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor michael emerson although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms here it is presented in purely secular ones if dr emerson has any deep religious convictions these are never expressed in the film he believes passionately however that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty ken therefore finds himself in a catch 22 situation he must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life emerson however considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital br br richard dreyfuss as ken and john cassavetes as dr emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity but this cannot hide the fact that whose life is it anyway simply does not work as a film at one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media when plays were filmed therefore the general tendency was to open them up by filming on location as well as on studio sets by taking liberties with the playwright's text often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters br br i have never seen brian clarke's play but i suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema there is very little physical action most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed such a plot does not lend itself to the opening up device at all and the resulting film is very static dominated by talk at the expense of action although it is well written and there is some good acting i am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject 4 10
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot revolves around a man named luther who wears metal dentures bites people on the neck and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms he also thinks he's a chicken br br sounds bizarre right well to me the more bizarre and weird the person is the better the more gore the better and so on br br the movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution they mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck he also like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken br br if i had a patient like this there is no way i would release him br br first luther heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away then he sneaks in the back seat of a woman's car and she drives all the way to her home br br while at the house luther ties up the woman to the bed when the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home luther hides br br later through the film a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother you can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay she replies that everything is fine the officer finally gets in his car and leaves if i saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared i would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a little br br the ending is stupid as well while the woman in in the barn she starts clucking and gets luther excited so he starts walking around flapping his arms and clucking like a maniac she finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally clucking some more br br then the credits roll br br this is one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen nothing happens at the woman's house nothing br br i sometimes like campy films but this one really bored me br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 good idea bad direction
<START> the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments i was disappointed the desert sands were interesting but this film along at a snails pace it started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings as they found dead bodies or should i say skeletons with some flesh on them they began a search for the reason why at times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert some type of black ooze or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans as the flesh was munched upon a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining humans the reason for this black ooze as we find out was pretty bad ants unbelieveable then the ending made no sense i guess the motto of this film will be when you have an itch and see an ant quickly kill it before the friends smell your flesh
<START> purported documentary that tries to examine sci fi films of the 1950s and how they affected and reflected america steven spielberg george lucas ridley scott and james cameron are interviewed and mark hamill narrates br br pretty terrible the insights that are given are nothing new for instance the cold war and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children well duh they try to cover all of the different sub genres of sci fi films of the 1950s the big bug movies invaders from space movies etc etc that's good but they choose the most obvious films and they've been over analyzed to death already it was cool seeing clips from x m destination moon forbidden planet the thing and the day the earth stood still but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that it's insulting even though it's under an hour i was thoroughly bored 30 minutes in this gets a 2 for some of the clips but nothing else
<START> no i'm not a radical bashing the hentai and yaoi genre i just find it really boring and pointless my god i was made to watch this for initiation from some stupid punk and my my even an mst3k movie has a storyline not to mention that this hentai crap is what's giving anime a bad name world wide watch out sailor moon sadly people don't realize that not all anime or any other asian style is sleazy porn death to the stereotype br br starts casting
<START> with so many horrible spoof movies this is sadly a breath of fresh air to the genre compared to classics like airplane or the naked gun this is awful but compared to recent spoof movies like meet the spartans and disaster movie this is very clever and original don't get me wrong though this was not a good movie in any way i laughed a few times and there are a few inspired gags but any pop culture reference falls flat on it's face as does most jokes in the movie br br fields david koechner was a bad coach in the past but now he's brought back to teach college football and this time he'll do a good job his wife melora hardin is feeling distant from him and his daughter is dating a football big shot to spite her father spoofs of various recent movies come into play as do a lot of sight gags and nonstop stupidity br br the best parts of the movie are the gags not relying on reference to recent movies spoofs of radio rocky dodgeball friday night lights invincible and many other sports movies are not funny in the least it's mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs like a bizarre crotch scratching scene or a chewing tobacco spitting joke these little throwaway giggles cannot carry the movie and by the end it's hard to watch the last 20 minutes are grueling to sit through br br the characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie however i'm sure the characters were built on clichÃ©s from the genre nonetheless they're not too bad david koechner can pull lead actor in a movie off too bad they gave him so much crummy material to work with matthew has fine comedic timing in a not always so comedic role as a ballet dancing football player with a cross dressing father carl rounds off the cast once again playing in a sub par sports movie not the rocky movies happy gilmore overall this is a goofy comedy at times it's funny but more often than not it's just very annoying and predictable br br my rating 1 2 out of 90 mins pg 13 for language sexual humor and drug humor
<START> being a fan of saint etienne and the city of london i was very excited to see this movie on the list of the vancouver international film festival this movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well london br br the movie is held completely in 'dark' colours which i personally don't like too much furthermore the narration was a little too british and the comments sometimes got a little flat other than that there are some great comments by londoners and excellent shots doesn't glorify london by showing all the great attractions of the city but rather gives deep insights in what london is really like from the east end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the 'special little for londoners br br all in all br br great soundtrack nice shots great insights br br narration to watch at times very dark picture br br worth watching i give it a 7 10
<START> i'm not the biggest fan of westerns my two personal favorites though are unforgiven and tombstone this movie though i loved it was great the plot was well done and it was a fun movie everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent i even think it beat out both movies in someway well not really unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run i do think it beat out tombstone though both had there strong points for instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming but posse beat out tombstone in four ways in my opinion first the characters were more unique in posse the music was better in posse the idea was original in posse unlike wyatt earp and the biggest difference the action sequences oh my gosh posse was a western with really good action sequences i mean really good the action was fast paced like modern day based shoot'em up movies the action had big budget explosions too the fistfights were pretty good also mario van pebbles was great in this movie i suggest buying this excellent movie
<START> perhaps i missed something but i found ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama as to the story it was trying to tell i found that a confusing mish mash that went off in all directions and perhaps it should have been made by a spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented english i can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar artist's model's tragic fate plot line as girl with a pearl earring was the movie a commentary on the religious injustices of the inquisition false piety torture then and now or what i never seemed to be able to figure that one out natalie portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical and ultimately the movie was crowned with the concluding melodrama of a disheveled head and body hanging on the edge of cart heading off into the and goya following along milos forman do better than that
<START> this was a strange film a bit horror and certainly film noir some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously start dying off with a japanese dagger in their hands after monsieur colomb bela lugosi shows up br br soon the lone ranger arrives in the person of fbi agent richard martin clayton moore martin is ineffective in finding the killer as he is more interested in the niece joan barclay of a missing doctor who is part of the gang br br after the last man dies and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum the true story of the group comes out and that is where it gets interesting and weird i won't spill it br br lugosi was marvelous as the skulking killer
<START> this is a film that revolves around two mysteries which i have now br br first did the film makers understand the concept of before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock comment on or pay homage through self depreciating humour to the original work in other words there should be reasons to parody such work and they should definitely be clever i didn't see any of those in the film i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery bryan probably went to eric roberts and said hey i was drunk last night watching survivors and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release i want you on board without reading the script because i plan to direct this film without one br br and herein lies the second mystery eric robert's career i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky now i realize it's because he is stupid and therefore deserves the career that he had after watching this movie it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films which has higher budgets more intense scenes and roles better acting and direction more elaborate and compelling plot lines and a much wider audience than this b movie reject c movie
<START> this movie was so weak that it couldn't even come up with good cliches to rip off i love horror movies and will see practically anything but if i had it to do over again i would have skipped this one entirely you may think that i'm exaggerating but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage not scary not funny not curious not worth it
<START> help once again paul schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull pedantic storytelling i rearranged a vacation so that i could see this world premiere what a mistake why did schrader even want to make an exorcist film lofty intentions are fine but if i wanted 2 hours of theological babble i would visit my nephew's sunday school father struggle with his faith as presented in his younger days is a potentially interesting subject but an exorcist movie needs more the relentlessly draggy presentation along with ridiculous special effects makes for a strange production who is this movie for i didn't bother seeing the harlin version but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills br br the exorcist series has been quite strange the first film was excellent but every sequel has been unloved and pointless why do they keep making them i suppose schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money but why should we go
<START> good film br br i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale Â£2 99 seems like a good deal and it is thing is the film is named to kill for it took a little detective work to find out it's original name br br in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ability to sell having seen final destination 3 last night it in my view should have been a 18 br br maybe the fact the delightful traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18 such a shame br br traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions she ability to turn what is branded a b movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing br br long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress
