<START> matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his single status and the footloose and available nurses on the staff whilst colleague and friend richard benjamin looks on with amusement and amazement their boss is hard of hearing going on senile chief of staff art carney who is up for re election to that post br br matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother glenda jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life at the same time he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential in a malpractice suit and to support the shambolic and incompetent carney in his attempt to be re elected chief of staff br br this is a superior old fashioned romantic comedy graced by four grade a actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first rate dry caustic and sarcastic script carney steals every scene he's in and in the parlance of imdb has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen we are otherwise entertained by the on off relationship of the two leads and various sub plots br br lacks the ambition to be a great film but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re watchable for its comedic value alone deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the dvd or video cassette
<START> it seems that hack has been described as un realistic but that's what tv is tv is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and i feel hack does a great job in that regard add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaging interesting plots you just can't seem to get enough plus with such great actors as david morse andre braugher and even little mathew what more can you ask for so if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters i suggest giving hack a chance especially now that it's finally getting off its feet
<START> i grew up in baltimore so i was exposed to the films of john waters since i was way too young to watch them and if you're knowledge of john waters is limited to hairspray or cry baby or other family friendly movies then you must prepare yourself for pink flamingos br br explicit sex acts incest an old lady who eats nothing but eggs and acts with chickens are just a mere portion of some of the depravity in this movie the film ends with divine waters' 300 lbs cross dressing star eating dog excrement br br the premise is about two families one a pair of inbred trailer trash which includes divine and edith massey as the egg lady and the other is a rich swinging couple both families are competing for the title of filthiest person alive enjoy john waters' finest movie but only see it if you're an open minded individual with a strong stomach because some scenes in this movie will gross you out
<START> there's nothing much to the story a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she works decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend julie and encounters an odd couple on the highway if you remember the elderly couple from rosemary's baby you have some idea of what these two are like bill has a comical face and is retired from the army sandra is an ex stripper now become a whore although we don't find this out at once they're affectionate helpful and full of common sense br br they more or less adopt the girl alice and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate rv although they are not driving directly to florida br br this is where the film could have gone one hundred percent wrong all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil they would take the virginal alice handcuffed to the bed or whatever and sell her body to any driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex alice would have had a heck of a time escaping with lots of aborted attempts before the final shootout but no the couple really is pretty nice and alice is far from virginal alice overhears sandra with a customer asks about the business and tries to turn a trick on her own bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all they don't talk her into it they guide her br br alice makes several hundred dollars which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it alice misunderstands she doesn't find whoring very pleasant work and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off sandra responds with what not here honey not in the middle of nowhere however after she is talked into handing her gun over to sandra the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to florida br br you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film it had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami julie is after all a legitimate student but when alice calls her friend from someplace in alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late julie hesitates and says well my mother doesn't think you should room with us and to tell you the truth my roommate isn't cool on it either i invited you down sure but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something go back to milford alice there is a long silence before alice hangs up br br only one shot is fired a few white frames of film and no one is hit tears appear only once nobody slugs anybody else no car explodes in a fireball no cop chases them down the interstate br br the direction is occasionally clumsy too much cross cutting between sandra trying to disarm alice and alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol there is hardly any musical score there is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward as it's probably supposed to be alice isn't unattractive but she is not either she sports asiatic eyes a kind of robust version of molly parker the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out the direction is a straightforward narrative with a few illuminating flashbacks nothing is wasted and it was all evidently shot around connecticut the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles br br i don't know exactly what alice found i dread even thinking that the answer to the riddle is that she found herself the acting isn't bad at all judith is better than that it's definitely worth seeing a quiet orderly film that treats the audience like adults
<START> infamous for being brought to you by the digital effects team behind independence day is even more of a spectacular failure just from being juxtaposed with this ridiculous mess of a film starts off with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there a wealthy soon to be married couple in beverly hills are the subjects of this idiotic story claire's fiancÃ©e has taken off on a business trip right around christmas so she decides to spontaneously fly to switzerland so they can spend the holiday together i especially love that her initial reason for wanting to go was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need she grabbed them up and yelled after him while he drove away concluding that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than call his cell phone i refuse to believe that a couple living in such a cavernous mansion as theirs were unaware of the existence of mobile phones br br so up until this point the movie is unbelievably bad but check this out this is where it starts to get bad she gets to switzerland and when she can't find her husband she gets some cake and calls her friend to whine about how unfair it all is this woman is not an action hero and she is definitely not a german indiana jones for crying out loud she is an overgrown cheerleader a pampered sorority girl whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels out of the ground when she gets tipsy enough to wander onto the lawn during a wine and cheese party out on the bluffs br br she gets a tip that her fiancÃ©e is in south america so she like totally flies there to get him once there this moron thinks she's going to go into the jungle by herself sniff out the enemy base and rescue her poor helpless boyfriend she laughs off a comment about the danger of going in there then freaks out later because she finds out that there are battles going on you never said anything about battle br br there is one point where claire and some journalist that she met up with drive this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across and suspended by two by fours literally there are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with twine and these morons decide to drive over it not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck but claire manages to fall off of it falling hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below later she recalls the event laughing it off like oh maybe it was only a hundred at least she wasn't twirling gum on her fingers br br what is truly sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to coax a terribly performance out of the tremendously talented john rhys davies a real indiana jones veteran there is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the film where we meet an extremist rebel leader who when we first meet him has such a thick accent that he rolls his r's like he thinks he's in a commercial then later he talks like some guy they pulled off the streets of venice beach unbelievable br br the special effects are negligible the team that brought you independence day by the very fact that they were involved with was simply going through the motions throwing together some matted and blue screen shots i have to believe because they just had nothing better to do the story is astonishingly bad and kristin dattilo who many other imdb users cite as the only reason to see the film doesn't put the slightest effort into her performance maybe she thought the digital effects team behind independence day could superimpose some meaning into this mess br br and given how far they've fallen maybe they thought they could too br br they could at least have tried
<START> without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the movie would be worth a seven br br one wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else
<START> if christopher nolan had made memento before following then all of the flaws in following would have been corrected in memento nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly we were able to tell when it was the past when it's current etc however nolan experimented with it a little and it just doesn't work although he had a small budget and couldn't use color which is one way memento worked it was just too hard to distinguish between time on the dvd is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order i intended to write my review after watching it so hopefully it would make more sense but of course it wasn't working br br you can't blame nolan for not coming up with original ideas a young man bill jeremy is bored so he decides to follow random people on the street he finds one cobb alex haw that particularly interests him soon bill becomes friends with cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them then a saucy young blond lucy russell enters and the movie becomes even weirder from there br br the ending of following is one of the most shocking endings i've seen sure fight club had an amazing ending but the way that ending played out was amazing i felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion nolan has a thing for making good endings well maybe not i could guess from a mile away and can really construct a great story following may not be the easiest to follow or look at but it's such a finely crafted original story with a shocker ending that you'll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again br br my rating 7 10 br br rated r for language and some violence
<START> unfortunately house of d is just awful with a ridiculous plot terrible writing some mediocre acting and in fact just about everything else about it is sub par br br tom flees nyc to somehow survive as a lone child in paris and manages to convince the beautiful parisian girl he eventually marries that he's french despite a poor grasp of her language she's shocked when years later he reveals his secret to her riiiight br br he then gifts his tale of woe to his own son and who we are expected to believe thinks that's just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give his 13 year old boy if only such things were so easy david duchovny his own wife tea leoni in the role of his mother and strikes out yet again leoni makes me laugh as a comic but she's just plain wrong for this role br br one of the problems with that is none of the characters are sympathetic i just didn't give a damn what happened to any of them i did rather hope that robin williams and his trademark child in a grown up's body schtick would fall into a village pothole but alas it was not to be and we had to endure his simpering performance all the way br br anton yelchin and william's daughter zelda were not bad but i suspect the rave reviews others are giving them is simply because they weren't anywhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie they weren't great let me put it that way br br there are so many silly and contrived aspects to this film the bicycle the catholic school and it's staff of morons the conveniently stupid characters etc that this review would go on for ever so i'll just finish up by saying that house of d is a very poor movie and i'm almost embarrassed for duchovny br br the thing that really annoys me is how i was so strongly encouraged by online friends to see this that i traveled a long way to do so br br i would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if i'd just wasted a couple of hours down at the local movie theater but instead i lost a whole day and discovered that my so called friends are either stupid or dishonest because this is an awful movie
<START> the merchant of four seasons was rainer werner fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance in a turbulent career of just fifteen years he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater both as a performer and a creative producer actor and director although this movie might not appeal to many viewers the film has much to offer the storyline is fairly straightforward a man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems and proves unable to control his downward spiral the merchant of four seasons is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and constructed every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama several times during the film i froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition i streamed this film and the print was nearly flawless and second to none fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement anti style he does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner and this creates a rather stilted effect however by doing so he injects an almost reality' to the narrative rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and tribulations you are constantly on the outside looking in this will be a disconcerting experience for many but i found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure
<START> i just saw this movie tonight 5th nov 2005 for the first time i wanted to watch it cause i saw the basketball diaries leonardo di caprio and loved that but this was far more heavy going i think it had a good depiction of drugs to an extent i empathize mostly with nick character probably because if i someone i was crazy about was on that stuff i'd want to help them get off it a promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studying well it's understandable that he'd want to try teenage life the crazy side of it and in his efforts as what begins is helping his friend he ends up addicted because he wanted to see what it is all about and because of his horrendous family situation which results in his most tragic death a truly sad film but one flaw i noticed is that you don't get a good enough insight into the damage it does to families but apart from that excellent performances on a truly heartbreaking movie
<START> spoiler this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending i hated this film mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons politically this film glorified war and military technology blowing things up real good we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the to bits and no u s soldiers put their lives on the line so it's a fun war aesthetically there isn't a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences and speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to i had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 9 11 with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong but that wouldn't leave the audience feeling good this is a feel good movie about killing and it made me sick
<START> this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life rod steiger who stars as the ornery grandfather charlie is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is the better his performance cue buzzer sound rod steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film although end of days is the 2nd worst film i've ever seen is really heartbreaking from the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction it becomes clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producer's last name ended in the only good thing about this film is that it is so bad it's truly hysterical look for the flashback scene where rod where's a jor el wig from superman and a big black porno mustache one only hopes that his follow up film i believe in america from uber producer kevin will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouths
<START> with the fairly recent release of carlos saura's in the united states albiet a limited art house only release it's high time for a re release of this fine documentary on rodrigues this film is a treasure chest of vintage film clips of on american television as well as various other film clips including one of her her mother that could easily reduce the most macho man to tears i first saw this fine documentary a few years back when it received the unjustified art house release it deserved far better fortunately various recordings exist of best recordings on various budget line recordings which are generally available in places such as k mart or best buy or if you do a little searching one can fine some of the original releases either on e bay or one of those distribution services that specializes in pricey european imported cd's there are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation the original version with no english subtitles and the u s version in with english subtitles except the european version cannot be played on most u s dvd players due to the pal colour line system not rated by the mpaa but contains nothing to offend
<START> as other reviews have stated there are a few missing videos from this collection but what is on this disc is overwhelming there are two separate soundtracks an original recording and a completely redone new performance version any new music from the residents is welcome and i suppose for a first time listener the new version may be more ear friendly but i prefer the original recordings probably simply because they are the originals production of this dvd is amazing new and old videos are all interesting with live performance videos probably the least interesting of what is offered although the snippets of live recordings hidden as easter eggs are extremely welcome this is not a renter this is a must own collection enjoy
<START> the production company for this film calls itself entertainment' and that is a surprisingly apt name this very is very entertaining from start to finish which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting every time a low budget zombie movie is released it will tend to be for the fans by the fans i do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies but too many more like this one and i'll be re evaluating my opinion the film seems to be a rip off of the half decent aussie zombie flick expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat everyone is wearing one but this doesn't make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times the credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that we're going to be in for an atmospheric film but when the movie starts properly it soon becomes apparent what we're actually in for naturally there's a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done though the good things i have to say about the film pretty much end there there's a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was overall this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies i don't recommend it
