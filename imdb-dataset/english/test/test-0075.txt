<START> even a awful 1 is to much for this film everything form start to finish made you cringe i don't think it would be possible to cram more overly clichÃ©d moments into one piece of mind numbingly numbingly waste of film br br prisoner cell block h meets thunderbirds hell even expressions were more life like than his son br br i haven't even finished watching this and i'm on here now oh no the cheesy clapping of 3 actors and a backdrop done by a child with adobe premiere this truly is the end of my i've started so i'll finish watching it phase br br oh joy the credits have come to rescue me and relax
<START> despite john travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role of his career be cool proves to be a disappointing sequel to 1995's witty and clever get shorty br br travolta delivers a pleasant enough performance in this mildly entertaining film but ultimately the movie falls flat due to an underdeveloped plot unlikeable characters and a surprising lack of chemistry between leads travolta and uma thurman although there are some laughs this unfunny dialog example which appeared frequently in the trailers kind of says it all thurman do you dance travolta hey i'm from brooklyn br br the film suggests that everyone in the entertainment business is a gangster or aspires to be one likening it to organized crime in get shorty the premise of a gangster going legitimate by getting into movies was a clever fish out of water idea but in be cool it seems the biz has entirely gone crooked since then br br the film is interestingly casted and the absolute highlight is a delivered by the rock whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a goon where he a scene between gabrielle union and kirsten dunst from bring it on vince character thinks he's black and he's often seen dressed as a pimp this was quite funny in the first scene that introduces him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterward br br overall be cool may be worth a rental for john travolta die hards of which i am one but you may want to keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through it without feeling that you wasted too much time fans of get shorty may actually wish to avoid this as the sequel is devoid of most things that made that one a winner i rate this movie an admittedly harsh 4 10
<START> this is a really really bad movie however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and special effects the plot centers around an eu space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth they send a mission they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet is anybody stupid enough to fall for this to the planet and can you believe it it's the mirror image of the planet they came from most everything is predictable from that point honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything the only surprising thing here is a space program run by there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness
<START> oh f cking hell where should i start first of all this show is just another stupid american non funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor the american way of laughing track business makes the whole thing even worse how come i can hear laughter yet there's nothing funny happening pretty stupid eh this show is only for those american people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier better and wittier comedies not only in great but also in america the simpsons for example i simply can't understand what is so good about reba that it has lasted for long a while in television it has nothing new to offer it underestimates the possible viewers in so many ways and it simply isn't funny at all i could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as reba but why the hell they had to run it here in finland if i see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me take my word and believe me this show sucks ass even more than these kind of american comedies usually does this is simply horrible do yourself a favor don't ever watch this peace of sh t br br well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better thanks for your possible interest
<START> i caught this show a few times when i was young and it was playing tilt my parents loved it and now in syndication i feel what they feel this show did what the original limits and twilight zone new and old couldn't do this show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas br br i still cannot believe jonathan and brad wright did this those guys were producers on stargate sg 1 the show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere this is what was not there in the new twilight zone rod serling coming in added to the scariness forest coming in lightened the mood br br the ending whether good or bad made for a scary time you could never predict what was going to happen i am still trying to find the seasons on dvd
<START> this turned out to be more of a women's romance soap suspense film than what i hoped it was simply a tense thriller yes the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious br br hauer was a little too subdued not playing his normal intense character natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing br br the story is so so it's not as bad as i'm making out but it sure isn't anything i'd watch again and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading
<START> ali g earned his fame on the small screen though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either ali g is a hilarious laugh a second fun fest just like on the small screen he has lost none of his character or stupidity at all and behind all that none of the film is brainless fluff either a human side to ali is revealed during the film the idea of ali g running for pm is a brilliant fresh and funny one and the incessant stupidity of gangster man is mixed well with the stern harsh world that is politics the film is also full of brilliant new characters and instead of just interview after interview we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring so why didn't i give it ten stars well the ending was funny but also botched and failed none of it made sense and in parts the film became offensive in trying to be funny but that's ali g for you if it isn't offensive it isn't itself and it is totally and utterly ruined ali g's big screen debut was a success in my belief and should have got into the 6 7 average rating range on imdb but it could have got worse as well and people are bound to have mixed opinions especially on a film such as this br br on the whole ali g is hilarious british comedy at its best and funniest and most clever a great job 9 10
<START> this is probably one of those films too many commented but undiscovered this is probably one masterpiece of spanish cinema like some masters piece 15 days with you could be the better now and them re from others films of long time ago could be midnight cowboy but could be also les amants du pont or a realistic and non spot look but most realistic trainspotting this hard story has place to humour love and obviously dramatic sense in the new social spanish cinema this little diamond could be the resurrection of the italian neo realism mixed whit the best ken loach films br br probably the better film i discover in the last 10 years
<START> it seems to me that a lot of people don't know that blade is actually a superhero movie on par with x men daredevil punisher and the likes what all these heroes and in the case of x men hero group have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of marvel blade was originally a normal person in a blue outfit who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring so boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the marvel universe at least until he was reinvented br br david did a stroke of genius when he took the character of blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight he can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to stephen as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character the blade character wesley snipes is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with batman like darkness snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character he is however a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels kris kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of whistler to life with energy and sense of timing wright however is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless donal is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character german udo kier should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race probably born of his experiences from playing dracula stephen dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as deacon frost stands as one of the best screen villains i have perhaps ever seen br br the story is good and i feel renews the vampire genre something that hasn't been done since robert from dusk till dawn by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel by saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic far from it a lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible including the effects which are pretty good for their time i found the vampire to be a very nice touch in stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies chose to let the vampires spontaneously com bust which looks great the fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face br br as previously stated has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following blade movies del toro is nearly as skilled but i prefer style his style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere a very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie br br all in all blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie suffice to say many of them are located near the ending of the film does that the film must settle with a high 7 br br 7 10
<START> i've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it br br the story begins with a duel between a righteous shaolin priest and our villain abbot white needless to say abbot white kicks buddhist ass and wages his campaign against shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring a black clad one who fights with a spear and my favourite one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet the rest of the story concerns the training of the disciples of the shaolin monks killed by abbot white one of whom is alexander lo rei whilst we are treated to the punishing training sequences the two young avengers must go through to learn the shaolin finger jab technique needed to defeat abbot white's invincible armour technique we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shape mostly using taoist magic to extract the blood from naked ladies we all know how this is going to end but it's the psychedelic trip in between that we're here for in conclusion this is a good example of what taiwan was doing when hong kong was getting sick of martial arts movies and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies this movie is very well choreographed has some nudity some gore and enough balls to the wall to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained visit your local today br br
<START> well dude where's my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written cast filmed edited in less than a day i honestly can't believe this got made or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be dumb funny and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it oddly enough unlike most mindless slapstick comedies this movie actually has too much plot every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot of course they were obviously going for moronic but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed from the old show salute your shorts has a very small role this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though you just watch
<START> i found the episodes to be fascinating and well written as a tv show it was entertaining which is what i expect from fictional entertainment i like the relationship between the professor and his female security guard although sometimes her scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying i was hoping that there would be more than just four episodes i recognize that one commenter reviewer of this series had comments relating to his opinion as a physician i understand this gentleman's comments however this is a fictional television series which is meant to entertain not present precise facts like a documentary patrick stewart performs well and makes his character believable if you want to watch a documentary then this is not the series for you but if you want to watch unique scientific based theories in an entertainment based medium then you will enjoy the four episodes
<START> highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies great acting perfectly surreal awkward humor requisite prison sh t accurate depiction of the male condition music is also spot on i think the artist is dip but not sure the short loop of the title credit song on the dvd menu is well timed and sounds like one thing to know is that imdb maintains a ridiculous policy of a minimum comment length based on not characters not words but rather lines measuring post quality and quantity based on lines in the bold era of and flexible web based typography is like smoking poles your comment does not contain enough lines the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text please see the guidelines attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions
<START> margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley as the title character and the ever bland timothy dalton as rhett even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is astoundingly cliched and predictable add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer scarlett is just amazingly lousy and i can't imagine how it ever got made much less made it to video
<START> i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie i agree the director it's not the actors are not oscar winners but it has something everyone could relate to i don't want to spoil but telling more then the plot the finishing of school and the trip to a big party or if you like to see beyond the metaphor is choosing the way trough life remember that days of youth the days when you or our friend acted like the characters or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didn't if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of this questions maybe the movie wasn't so bad
