<START> this is the episode that probably most closely relates to it's partner law thou shalt not kill in that it directly brings up the ever controversial issue why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong this issue is presented in two parts within the episode before the killing when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic up and coming lawyer and the street thug so caught up in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what he's supposed to do followed by the period after the trial and before the execution when both are made to suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and thus share br br one of the great things about the way these episodes work are in the both small and big ways the story is fully developed so that we understand both the motivations and histories of characters we're only able to spend slightly less than an hour with for all his criminal intentions and mockery the killer is still very sympathetic revolving the most important part of his actions around a history of accidental death his way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy similarly the lawyer's idealistic naivety shows one unwilling to allow death to happen in a world where he can't control it their meeting is indeed important they both have to give in to it while not propagating it br br as an aside it's interesting how much this episode affects viewing of rouge kieslowski's later completion of the trois colours trilogy one of kieslowski's biggest influences seems to be the idea of justice and considering that the decalogue is a meditation on something that represents divine justice this one seems almost the most self conscious br br polarisdib
<START> this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first wireless lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons so it's up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day br br this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8 it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film after all he knew nothing about westerns his forte was drama and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts just set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job br br as for the rest of the film it's exceptional with vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decision he was supposed to be a harvard educated when i saw barton was also in the film i pretty much assumed he'd be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton was a lot better than i'd hoped making this movie ending on a very high note
<START> nothing great here but a nicely acted story about an abused deaf wife fonda of a small time crook bochner who gets involved with one of her husband's plans and his mistress sutherland and weber are cops drawn into what turns out to be a unmysterious murder investigation and the story just flows along
<START> br br as a harold lloyd fan i agree with the other reviewer's comments except that i feel that movie crazy was his best sound film cat's paw is a close second but this is just my opinion br br this film is a hoot from beginning to end and in many scenes george the crook that gets him elected mayor almost steals the show especially at the end of the film br br one wishes that una character would be a bit more sympathetic to harold especially as the film progresses only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him and even then there is no romance kissing etc br br this is a must see film
<START> my friends and i saw the movie last night in austin at a showing for a film festival this movie was one of the best i've seen this year it was a great comedy very original and heartfelt and funny as hell everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie texas is a big state with lots of small towns and of course plenty of teenagers who grew up as fat girls i know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level ashley fink and robin de jesus were awesome they were so great in these rolls it was like the script was written with them in mind and speaking of the script it was very well written very believable and ash is a great actor his facial expressions alone made me giggle it is an independent film but don't let that fool you it's a good one seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring

<START> contains spoilers br br russia in the 13th century the opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion moldering uniforms human skulls and a horse's skeleton prince alexander nevsky nikolai chased the swedish army away and impressed the mongol ruler to such a degree that he proposes to promote him to the rank of captain but nevsky replies die in your homeland but don't leave it he intents to fish build ships and trade but he warns of a more dangerous enemy nearer meaner and no possibility to buy oneself out germany their objective is they have already reached mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons the marauding occupation forces distribute the rich merchants want to purchase their liberty always a place for some anti capitalist p r but the common people are ready to fight they want alexander as their leader is burned to the ground the teutonic knights feel invincible and have just a smug smile for the russian women who witness helplessly how their fathers and sons are butchered babies are thrown in the fire while high dignitaries of the church look on and remain idle in olga has two admirers rich and staid and tall and jolly she promises to marry the most valiant calls on alexander nevsky in the prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike at once even women put on a chain armor the invaders want to bait the russian bear but stratagem stands the test lake is his war zone his men know the territory but the germans who are heavier will break through the ice br br open your eyes and watch the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed it's not just the multitude of extras who were i think pressed in this patriotic exercise but eisenstein's masterful management of such a large number of individuals he divisions like pieces on a chess board and nearly every shot resembles the composition of a painting by rembrandt or rubens including horses in outfits russia in winter looks intimidating in itself but eisenstein's visual imagination is heaps of corpses are plunged in cosmic light under an endless horizon at nightfall olga and other women search with torches for survivors a devoted falcon sits on his master's dead body while a crow waits for the right moment to pick out the eyes of the deceased eisenstein's direction and score make alexander nevsky the rolls royce among propaganda films nevsky is of course alter ego and the russians are tall good looking heroic and they have a perfect hairdo the germans are bearded savages and look like members of the ku klux klan the actor who plays gives a one man four characters performance first wavering then heroic youthful lover and comic relief main duty is to look heroic at the end nevsky stalin displays his generosity he pardons the little soldiers and barters the knights for soap only a bearded killer and a traitorous cleric are turned over to the mob he does not forget a final warning who comes with the sword will die by the sword he kept his promise 10 10
<START> what can i say about this such a big prestige production but in the end wasted time wasted money br br this work a disaster is historically seen only some examples br br augustus often is named his first name but the old romans don't used this name correct would be the surname gentile and or the br br livia was shown as wife but this historically wrong br br was shown as nice young woman but she wasn't one adultery and maybe prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her banishing br br she wasn't at the dying bed of her father she never was allowed to leave her banishing and she was at this time around 50 years old not as young as she was shown in the same year augustus died she committed suicide because stopped giving her a pension br br augustus was much more then in this movie shown but author and director seems to believe own br br what remains historically extremely doubtful bad acting bad built and equipment 2 points out of 10 one for peter o'toole
<START> where to begin i like the scary snow monster named jack frost the whole concept works well for me we thought he'd be back and he was changing the local to a tropical resort works seeing old friends and meeting new characters scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance yup jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first i do have one complaint the little jacks or the as i call them they looked like hand puppets i think they could have done a better job with the the mouth could have opened wider but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again if you liked jack frost then you will like this sequel no questions or debate 9 big stars
<START> well what do you know i was painting my house today and an elton john song came on the radio which immediately took me back to this movie which i saw in 1971 so long ago and so far away ten years later i hitched through the country side of france and i sure would have been keen to see michelle the film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards more's the pity but it seemed rather racy back then a few years later a sequel was made with michelle living in a high rise in paris and paul coming back to meet her just like life they had moved on the film was very downbeat still the original was fab and if you can get a copy go rent it just remember to give it its' due and treat it gently i note americans can be rather prudish so take note contains scenes and themes possibly upsetting to middle america
<START> you have to see this i could not stop laughing about the stupidities i saw in this movie even late after the event there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie the acting is bad the story is so predictable and flat the effects are like 50 years old the supposed thriller is nowhere you will not enjoy the movie but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it we had a great time after the movie truly me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen
<START> br br the play has been heavily edited and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed up the acting is appalling especially by helena bonham carter and the cinematography poor br br the result is a slow confused boring film which will put those new to shakespeare off shakespeare instantly br br if you can't see a stage play then at least see the olivier version 1948 instead of this drivel
<START> a very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation which is all to rare these days i would compare this film to the day of the another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal the acting across the board is superlative aidan quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist carlos and as the navy man who impersonates him donald sutherland plays the amoral cia agent who hires him ben kingsley plays the israeli officer who assists in the plan this is a very tense and effective film and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it the first half of the film is all set up as the navy man prepares to impersonate carlos the second half is a breathless actioner the action coming out of the characters and their situations thus making it all the more gripping a really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked
<START> this horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where i thought to myself this is going to be really good however it gets rather boring rather quick at the end the acting is fairly good as is the location and the story starts out rather well too the problem not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running i wanted to see more especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where i thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner unfortunately after that the movie showed the monster very little and the back of the dvd lied as it told me that the desert beneath the people literally came alive and was capable of devouring their flesh now that would have been some movie a nearly inescapable situation granted that would have made viewers uncomfortable and it might of ramped up the tension but that is what horror movies are supposed to do instead we have very few shots of the creature or creatures as it were and when we do see it it is mainly on the defensive still it wasn't all bad it just needed more horror less hunting and more chomping
<START> this is a pretty simplistic romance girl finds boy girl loves boy girl loses boy girl finds boy colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic romantic performance well deserving of an oscar nom equally fine are the aerial combat special effects br br moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi she is the daughter of the regiment loved as a little sister into this mix comes a fill in for a downed flyer gary cooper at first they hate each other then they love each other then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him moore searches for him is told at a hospital he is dead then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited br br it's a nice little romance but hardly more than that recommended for fans of ms moore and mr cooper
