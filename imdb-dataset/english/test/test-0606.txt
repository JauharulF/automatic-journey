<START> very rarely it happens that i sit down to write a comment for a movie but this movie oh my holy god never ever was there a hindi movie better than this and never ever there came a movie better than this it's the king of all comedies br br aamir khan is arguably the best comic actor in indian film industry though its funny to say that because he is a class act not a comedian but what he has done in this film is perhaps the most hilarious performance by any indian actor in an out and out comedy br br salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes but this movie got the best out of him he was innocently comic if ever there was a term like it just what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the movie was concerned br br rajkumar santoshi i don't know why never tried his hand at comedy again he directed great ventures like the legend of bhagat singh and khakee but could not recreate the magic of br br i don't care why this film bombed at the box office though i feel sad that a film like hum aapke hain kaun was the reason for it's failure as of now i hope the rumors become true there'll be 2 they say we as the audience can only say amen
<START> good to see i'm not the only person who remembers this great film i have very fond memories of this movie seem to vaguely remember back to when i was about 8 and i'd watch the kids tv shows after school broom cupboard anyone this was the first and last film to scare me and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever like most films of this era it has a happy ending aimed at children but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention the lovely cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated and the ghostly scenes are simple but very very effective i'd love to try and find this movie again see if it still hits home
<START> oh how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their paul schrader author of taxi driver when this movie came out i never saw the qualities they were detecting when i watched this movie back in the day so i re viewed it to see if i got it wrong mishima is extremely uninteresting this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living working in a chilly culture the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to about purity the admiration of swords etc br br it must be a triumph when you learn you've landed philip glass but then you have to get something out of him glasses score offers not a whit of distinction from his other work nor does it provide the film any perceptible value in 2010 it should be clear to anyone that schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance cat people autofocus light sleeper patty hearst american gigolo he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films
<START> the cinematography is the film's shining feature park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own i hope there's a blu ray release of this film because it will look fantastic it's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for his vision sang has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight he doesn't however have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror br br although i've never seen the film i couldn't help but feel like this was chan wook park's version of twilight the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sang and tae love for one another it felt like the adult version of twilight really there's a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure maybe it's the chan wook park fanboy in me but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two the psychological aspect that i love about park's previous films is in thirst as well that's a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite the soundtracks to park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove thirst is no exception while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly br br the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film it's weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it's hard to imagine thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut nevertheless it is my one nitpick of the film br br chan wook park bites into the vampire mythology with thirst and puts his own dark psychological twist on it park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist that'll mess with your head and a memorable ending thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd and eventually blu ray hopefully
<START> i think together all the reviewers have captured this film really well i have seen it many many times but i still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as i did the first time my emotional response to this film never seems to fade the final scene certainly brings me to tears but so does the scene between perks and the children on his birthday and as for the kindly gentleman something else is going on with that character the generous provider and solver of problems he knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere a perfect father to run to and make us feel safe i do not know how the film does it but it touches something very english deep inside which has long gone from our daily experience but yet we all instantly recognise and yearn for again
<START> this is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre it makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc br br the topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite the play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand it's somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing if this was intended then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement specially for such an young director br br it's actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself
<START> i got a few laughs out of this one more than a lot of other so called comedies the big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of it's scenery was fun as was getting to see some of dyan cannon's curves this wasn't the height of lemmon's and career but it wasn't a total dog as some suggest
<START> after putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat scan a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure thus freeing the spirit or phantom if you will of the mummy belphegor due to convenient circumstances lisa who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit soon enough she's stealing the museum's egyptian treasures out from under their nose detective comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief br br this is a serviceable enough if you haven't seen any other incarnations of before if you have i recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery it plays out like a slightly higher budgeted sci fi original film and i don't really mean that as a compliment br br eye candy sophie shows ass side boob br br my grade c br br dvd extras none
<START> out to sea is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of jack lemmon and walter matthau this film is not quite as funny as their grumpy old men comedies which it strongly resembles but there are many laughs throughout lemmon and matthau play a couple of in laws who take a cruise together once they get on the boat the thing lemmon doesn't know is that matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise this infuriates lemmon who's in no mood to dance what's worse matthau doesn't even know how to dance nevertheless they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members here are the crew members there's the cruise director gil played to the hilt by star trek the next generation veteran brent spiner who acts like an evil dictator there's two fellow dance hosts played by barney miller star hal linden and veteran movie musical star donald o'connor there's the ship's owner mrs carruthers played by golden girl rue as for the passengers there's vivian a widow played by gloria de haven who falls in love with lemmon there's liz played by one of my all time favorite actresses dyan cannon who falls in love with matthau there's mavis liz's mother played by veteran stage actress elaine and they meet others as well all these actors are a pleasure to watch as lemmon and matthau play off of them it's great to see cannon here see's beautiful as ever is a hoot spiner is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight de haven is wonderful linden o'connor and have a good moment or two and finally the two main stars lemmon and matthau are fine as usual a nice little gem of a comedy br br out of four
<START> remarkably well done but under recognized because of limited distribution has big studio feel understands the horror genre speeds along with clever plot twists and never stumbles could have been a college cult classic if it had ever gotten the opportunity
<START> really don't care that no one on here likes this movie i do and that's what this review is about lou diamond phillips is great in this comedic role that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic the cg is great yeah train looks a little fake but the aliens wow do they ever rock todd bridges where's arnold and mr drummond wow he's been out of the loop guess that's what jail does to you a bullet train is on it's way to las vegas with the senator for him to deliver a big speech a meteor has just hit and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train and our hero cop has to save the day to make matters worse his ex wife is on board arguing with him i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action
<START> i have one word focus br br well br br imdb wants me to use at least ten lines of text okay let's discuss the fine points of focus i don't know about the rest of you but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap like all be famous avant garde filmmakers but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called focusing the lens it was amazing you give a little twist and wham everything is clear as a bell the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus lighting too this movie is not only completely out of focus it's also lit like the corner of someone's basement br br don't even get me started on pacing or plot they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot br br but who cares about that anyhow there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film's best friends focus and lighting br br words to the wise
<START> spreading panic from broadway to bombay 1957's the giant claw boasts perhaps the ultimate flying monster in movie history described by one terrified quebecois witness as la Â she's de devil in de storm with de face of de wolf and de body of de woman with wings bigger than i can tell it doesn't say much for canadian women since when we finally see it in focus it's a cross between an overgrown buzzard a and gonzo the great but this isn't just any old giant turkey Â impervious to rockets invisible to radar and with a taste for swallowing parachutists whole and pecking away at the united nations building it's an extraterrestrial giant turkey from an anti matter galaxy millions of miles from earth that's come here to build a nest no other explanation is possible luckily for humanity jeff morrow test pilot and chief cook and bottle washer in a one man society invents a weapon to disable its impenetrable shield so they can hit it with everything but the kitchen sink Â but don't worry morris general assures him we've got kitchen sinks to spare son Â just in time for a last minute clinch with co star mara some of the dialogue has dated rather unfortunately Â i admire your spunk and you keep climbing on our backs whenever we've messed up Â and strangely enough it's nowhere near as much fun as a film with a giant flying turkey should be but the beast itself is such a truly memorable creation for all the wrong reasons that it's hard to dislike even if you are liking it for all the wrong reasons and full marks to the cast for delivering gem after gem of with a straight face honest to pete i'll never call my mother in law an old crow again the only trouble is that the last time i talked to a chaplain there wasn't any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help we need and the immortal there it is now attacking the united nations building
<START> a very un tom and jerry short jerry narrates this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival butch tom is best friends with jerry here which irked me a bit the cartoon is also presented in cinemascope overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing the should have just put puss gets the boot on the dvd instead and i would've been happy this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brother's 2 dvd spotlight collection set it's the last one on the set and i'm hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soon br br my grade c
<START> this existential thriller in portuguese with english subtitles is a modern version of the american filmes of the 40s complete with a surprise twist at the end it is riveting from beginning to end my only criticism is its poor production values the film looks cheaply made and it probably was so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of godard in vivre sa vie to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier most maddening of all the subtitles are often hard to read when will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background i'd give this an 8 overall although with better production values it could have been higher
