<START> the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog eat dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability i've got no problem with the human side of being portrayed but bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft comical men the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who though exciting was extremely dangerous and fearsome br br the acting's all good and the direction very solid the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting did bugsy really want to kill
<START> mishima a life in four chapters is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima who committed suicide in the 1970s it is not really a biopic at least not one in the traditional sense but an exploration of iconoclastic oeuvre the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an totally engaging manner paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work it doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it an added bonus as we see fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema john bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good the of composer philip glass' work is perfectly suited for the project mishima is the best film i've seen this year so far
<START> a beautiful film one that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed made me think about death but not fear it think about life but not hide from it a movie that gave both love for all i stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell a movie that made me think of love and all that i have lost but no sadness graced my eyes for some strange reason relief a child of two worlds god and theater and a good bit of wine and irony i most highly recommend br br when the s hits the fan get a tent oh and we should all go camping every day
<START> let's get one thing straight this was bad so putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories br br the ever repeating storyline who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances a typical storyline goes as follows sue the mother opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful as if that doesn't get old har de bloody har some australian quasi nationalist look it up appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode a small mercy br br the rest of the plot revolves around the father gary getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out br br the phrase words fail me is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say it is so incredibly bad so horrible that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on br br it saddens me though to see someone as good as sally good actress i like her make a prat out of herself o hanlon my hero aside has the ability to be pretty funny but not here and ben elton distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this thing then comedy is in very serious trouble
<START> ingrid bergman cleo has never been so beautiful gary cooper as so perfectly cast as a laconic texan who knows this gal is up to no good when the two lock eyes at the french market we know this match will be full of sparks when they stroll in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics br br the costumes are lovely the set decoration makes you wish the quarter was just that way and that saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old gossiping br br from edna novel the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry br br in the saratoga scenes florence bates as a grand dame steals every scene br br but it is the scene of cleo taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment after cleo has bested him in the negotiations he looks at her with longing and says may i say you are very beautiful and cleo with a happy wicked smile says yes isn't it lucky you want to shout yes br br one of my all time favorite romantic films
<START> with knightly and o'tool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or not the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low cost heartstring elements
<START> beautiful film set in 1962 hong kong about a man mr chow and woman mrs chan who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair stylistically the film is also beautiful wong kar wai uses a lot of slow motion and close ups on parts of the body feet hands waist the film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period it's sexy without showing everything wong kar wai also doesn't allow the audience to see what the spouses look like suggesting that mr chow and mrs chan should be together smoking is even made to look elegant with close ups of the curls of smoke a really lovely film just prepare yourself for the ending br br
<START> who can ask for more taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk i admit but well worth it they were enthralled from credit to credit with their parents beside them br br i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results too scary too boring too sophisticated whatever with this film however i was glad to see a smart film with wit style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen any film that takes 5 years of production to make good or bad deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this br br o k i'm gushing a little then again why wouldn't i get excited looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed at least for the moment regardless w g is a film well made perhaps the originality wasn't the most inspired nevertheless well told and well paced br br too much adult humour too many sex references maybe though my kids didn't quite catch them too young so in my case i didn't really notice br br well needless to say i liked it
<START> the only thing more full of holes than this movie's premise is its script is the ideal showcase for joel schumacher's glorious flamboyant brazen lack of talent the plot is totally illogical but super fake ponderous and everything is art directed within an inch of its life in the most clichÃ©d overheated way i love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum low lit in red with huge rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls i love how keifer sutherland drives a canvas backed army jeep no one in joel schumacher's movies lives in an un eccentric manner it's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip but hip strictly and obsessively according to an out of touch middle aged billionaire man child's idea of hip and holy crap the part where baldwin brother 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he's slept with who i'll call you and i just need some space is the funniest friggin' thing in the whole universe what kind of a world do we live in where joel schumacher gets to keep having people throw money at him made me want to review the man's entire oeuvre solely for the kind of high quality yuks contained therein
<START> i enjoyed stefan Â a cool and fast story which didn't get bogged down in detail those two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time the high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot br br stefan show that the german film industry is capable of transferring successful hollywood concepts with local into our cinemas
<START> not well done at all the whole movie was just the grudge going around and killing random people out of nowhere random people that have nothing to do with the story get killed like the 3 school girls for example br br the family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story either i believe them to be a random family that never went in the house and never had anything to do with the killings of the grudge br br did not impress me at all i was not scared i didn't jump at any parts and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of makes the 1 look like crap also which was actually an alright movie br br i believe that the grudge 2 is like a leading movie to the grudge 3 if they ever make one they shouldn't have even called this the grudge 2 they should of called it the prologue to the grudge 2 and you will see if you watched it because i am not going to spoil anything not that it would have mattered anyway br br 1 10 not scary bad story and is just completely random
<START> this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it such a smart comedy very precise yet easy the casting can not be any better all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly the greatest of all is when the village people's ymca is cued in it brings out the importance of the statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies i give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated
<START> i first heard about the melancholy of from a reviewer on youtube he literally slapped the show with a big bad rant condemning it rubbish and confusing curious i decided to watch the show once i got the order of the episodes right thanks to those who made the lists and i found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious a unique and not over blowing plot that makes sense now that i've watched the show and two of the best anime moments in history in my opinion plus the opening and ending themes are great br br the anime based on a collection of successful manga novels follows a simple plot once you understand it while the show's focus is on the main character the point of view is from her friend is a regular high school student who doesn't really believe in supernatural stuff e g santa clause aliens time travellers ghosts but he soon ends up talking to who is the most oddest girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien considering all men worthless she even joined every club in the school to find something interesting but quit as quickly as she joined upon advice from decides to form her own club with club setting up in the literary club room forms the sos brigade its mission to investigate supernatural cases think scooby doo minus the dog the masked man and the mystery machine br br recruits three extra members the first is yuki a bookworm of sorts who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting the second is a shy girl who is forced into the club by who thinks they need a cute mascot to get some things done she is often forced into costumes by to further her cuteness the third is a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling while thinks her group is filled with normal people she couldn't be more wrong while is as normal as you can get the other three on the other hand are rather unique yuki is an alien is a time traveller from the future and is an a person who has esp all three have come to watch over who may just have the powers of a god and if she becomes bored she may be able to discover her powers and create a whole new world and is involved somehow br br the show is worth watching with great characters music and some hilarious and wonderful moments however for parents there is some sexual references including cleavage being exposed or touched several times and several swear words used as well apart from that the show is one of the greats
<START> i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight midnight cowboy coming home has ever done but a real tribute to teachers br br despite incredible odds pat conroy voight managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like mr hume cronyn but teachers like conroy will always be winners br br voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him he didn't overplay the role and i found him to be totally believable voight is br br besides a love of teaching we also see another important point in this film no matter how good you are at your job if you rock the boat the bureaucrats will get you
<START> i just saw this film at the sidewalk film festival in birmingham al which was actually a really fun festival and was blown away by it it was the best movie i saw all day by a long shot a school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together it's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality story stems from real life occurrences ripped straight from the headlines raw blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end the film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity definitely not suitable for kids too depressing for some people's tastes definitely worth checking out in my opinion though
