<START> i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say i was not impressed not at all i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances but some good performances do not make a good movie br br on the discussion board i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points it says is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes the brilliant acting of barbara and andrÃ© schneider the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work steffen ritter make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips especially in sound however the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains unfortunately this is true i wasn't intrigued by the story at all the protagonists are cold ambition less people they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of incestuous sex so what for many times the direction seemed to be virtually non existent not to mention the technical aspect the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing br br what's the point of the movie what's the message behind it all the anonymous reviewer said somehow failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid air without a message thus the boredom i blame on the movie the movie is reserved and emotionless cold almost neutral and it doesn't take long to see the flaws for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation the character of the mute brother is not developed very well some moments are very promising though in the scene where the call boy is skinned the one and only true love scene an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away again i must agree i did like the final scene especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni and andrÃ© schneider but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes the sex scenes though were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited br br all in all deed poll was not my cup of tea a good controversial idea wasted but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director this would have become a better movie
<START> i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time br br i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious br br the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen br br well done
<START> i'm not really much of an abbott costello fan although i do enjoy who's on first and to be honest there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work it wasn't really bad it had some mildly amusing scenes and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy baer but somehow given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which they're generally held i have to say i was expecting more as the story goes the pair stumble into a babysitting job and during the reading of jack the as a bedtime story with the kid reading it to costello jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story there's a wizard of oz kind of feel to the story in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of real life acquaintances of jack and the movie opens in black white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly dorothy ford are among the amusing parts of the movie polly of course also leads to one of the questions of the movie what happened to her jack and gang apparently left her behind in the castle i know it was just a dream so who cares still i wondered there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines my 4 year old giggled a bit during this so she was able to appreciate some of the humour i found it to be an acceptable but certainly not anything that would convince you of abbott and costello as comic geniuses 4 10
<START> two days ago i got a chance to watch this movie on cable tv asia i have been very disturbed since then the movie baghban has been very successful in portraying only one side of the real life it is highly partial towards parents have you ever thought of other side kids there are few parents in this world who just give birth to their kids but don't give right parental care i am a victim of that why do you parents want to have 5 kids in your life if you are merely making only rs 2000 per month i was made to work on streets along with my siblings i have no idea how i managed to reach from there it has been a long time since then but still i don't believe now i am a research scientist here in usa i have provided all the necessities to my parents along with care by my two brothers who stay along with them they could not provide basic things to us when we were kids i find this movie very resentful its very partial it has hurt my sentiments very deeply i strongly urge the producer director of this movie to look at the indian society in other point of view also and make another movie i can be reached at john yahoo com
<START> in a small picturesque sicilian village someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys the local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects including voyeuristic village retard giuseppe vito and an elusive grungy voodoo doll poking backwoods witch named florinda bolkan there's also don alberto marc a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school andrea tomas a journalist helping to aid the police and the beautiful patrizia barbara bouchet a gorgeous but seriously screwed up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very i mean very young boys as typical with the giallo subgenre the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames but if you can hang in there long enough this film pays off the script written by fulci gianfranco and roberto keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work cinematography by sergio and musical score by riz ortolani the acting particularly bolkan is also very good fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s like the beyond and zombie will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery bizarrely yet effectively set to singer ornella ballad a te and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film the psychic 1977 scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen except for a brief strangulation but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses the film was not released theatrically in america and presumably because of some anti catholic elements in the storyline received only a limited theatrical release in europe
<START> i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it in the 1970's there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise it's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to excellent comedic performance which still stands as one of his greatest this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time while this film is hilarious and meatballs 2 is so bad that it's fun meatballs 3 and meatballs 4 are absolutely dreadful recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters
<START> i liked this movie for the most part but have to say had there been anyone else besides bill murray in the lead role it would not have been as good he brings an energy to the role that steps this film up a notch than it would have been otherwise i mainly enjoyed the pranks pulled on the one counselor and there are other humorous things in this movie too such as the hot dog eating contest this movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end nearly every camp movie has either this or the unruly or troubled kids plot or a combination of both this series also would take a rather strange shift in tone as this one and two are both family friendly movies while part three and four are more adult oriented more like the old teen sex comedies of the time it kind of did the opposite of the police academy movies that went from r to pg 13 to pg movies this series goes from the opposite to r still this first one and only good one is worth some chuckles largely due to bill murray
<START> this film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny it's just that there is nothing of interest in this film there are no real jokes that make you amused you just watch for 80 minutes then turn it off i bought this on very budget dvd and i'm glad because it's not worth much this isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk high and have a good giggle i didn't hate it like i hate some films but it is rather boring and not worth investing any time in br br the only people who voted 10 on the votes for this film must have been connected to it somehow because i cannot imagine anyone actually liking this film other than small children passing time
<START> i read the recent comments and couldn't wait to see the movie however after sitting through 80 minutes of predictable suprises that didn't even make me jump and unrealistic villain i was left hugely disappointed i thought cartoons were the only movies that were still only 80 minutes long i thought this might be because of the edits to make it 'r' rated but the original only contained ten more minutes of kill bill type blood when blood sprays out like hoses reality loses appeal add in the killer who's supposed to be a ghost but can rip someones head off from the jaw ala king kong with the t rex lives through everything and has an ending similar to that of the sopranos finale and you quite possibly have the most over hyped movie in the last year after watching the movie i felt like i had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and also felt largely unsatisfied i dunno what everyone else saw in it but if you want a good horror movie this weekend see halloween it's definitely worth the 10 when it comes to hatchet let's hope the next one is based on the book
<START> first things first i am by no means a picky movie watcher i'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize i like most other people watch to be entertained i'll basically watch any type of movie of no matter how bad anyone says it is sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of with all that aside lil pimp was simply pathetic i saw it on tv and just didn't know what i was watching it was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie and had way too much sex innuendo and swearing to be a kid's movie in fact i doubt even kids would be amused by it the humor pretty generous even calling it that was so pretentious and campy i couldn't see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny the only thing that made me laugh was how people like bernie mac and ludicrous could put their name and time onto into something so hurting character was such a cheap ploy for laughs which fell extremely short of its goal the plot didn't make any sense whatsoever the storyline has got to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on screen i could keep going on but i want to see what people think of my reaction before i start discussing specific instances of pathetic scenes all i have to say is it really has to make ya wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees trying ta get it made br br j
<START> i am a huge horror fan particularly spanish horror this film had so many possibilities to be good it's a marvelous idea a vigilante ghost nun as most of what has come out of mind both visual and sound effects were also pretty good but everything was shamefully spoiled by bad direction awful casting and a painfully bad exposition exposition script too bad maybe should write and direct himself a remake br br moreover i don't really understand why this had to be spoken in english by actors who can't really speak english and when they do they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake if you look at contemporary spanish horror films like el or rec the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story and that is being realistic being believable as someone like ourselves like real people because that is the only way horror achieves it's goal unfortunately everything failed in la
<START> gave it two stars because the dvd cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure i paid a dollar for it at the local dvd exchange and i want my money back i have a couple of good movies at least i think they're good that have never seen the inside of a video store after seeing this i'm really insulted by that light years worse than anything i've ever seen i can't even recommend this as a campy joke movie it is so bad instead of making you laugh it makes you angry how did this awful film find any kind of i can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish dvd authoring would suggest to the producers of this movie get out of the business it's obvious you have no talent for it
<START> i'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with but how did this seem like a good idea just because you have a camera some big ugly friends for actors and delusions of talent does not mean that you should go out and make a film this should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower i e it should never have seen the light of day however somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle it goes from bad to worse talk about low budget one torture scene consists of a guy getting a mug of coffee thrown over him while he's tied to a chair evidently this is very painful because the big baby proceeds to scream in agony maybe he ordered decaf the acting is worse than wooden i could possibly watch a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored if you can look at this rubbish for that long you're a better man than i and the fight scenes would be at home on a kindergarten play yard do not touch this movie unless you enjoy pain in which case you should try spilling lukewarm coffee over yourself i'd like to say it's so bad it's good but really this is just awful
<START> i have never ever seen such a bad movie before the scene where they shoot some guy the pistol don t even shoot damn that is baad the scene with the boy is even not that good no script not any good sound not anything good to say about this movie
<START> watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film thankfully the movie was entertaining suspenseful and realistic there never is the perfect crime and armored showed why the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals the last hour of the film is very entertaining matt dillon is still a very good actor hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age i would buy this movie i give armored eight out of ten not a christmas movie did i write ten lines yet nope anyways there is not to many action films armored has a lot of excitement in it which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy
