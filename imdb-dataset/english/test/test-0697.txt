<START> black friday did this plot so much better which is why it is remembered and the man with two lives is just a forgotten potboiler shed no tears was it's working title and it would have been a better one as he was a thoroughly evil character for most of the film br br philip bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in a traffic accident dr clark edward keene has been involved in some experimental operations on animals bringing them back from the dead his colleagues urge him to try his operation on phillip who has died as he is operating a dangerous criminal wolf is going to the electric chair and trans migration of the soul occurs when phillip awakes from the operation he has the soul of he is a changed person he is rude to his family and starts to hang around old haunts he takes over wolf's old gang going by the name of philip bennett he also romance's wolf's former girlfriend who smells a rat bennett as wolf is determined to even up scores and starts to eliminate his enemies bodies pile up including the girlfriend and a policeman then his own family begins to fall victim br br but i hate those bad dream movies you always feel let down this film would have been better if he had stayed in character as and had a final shoot out eleanor his fiancÃ©e would have ended up sadder but wiser with his brother br br edward norris the star had a big career mostly in b movies br br not really recommended
<START> or any stories reminiscent of the leopold and loeb case you may find this movie entertaining the cast includes robert culp with stephen and garrison as the college students br br peter falk is his usual self pretending to be tricked by the precocious students longtime companion buried alive is excellent and should do more of these menacing roles basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents who expect nothing less than academic perfection attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they conform there is an excellent scene wherein culp rakes over the coals after he gets a low grade threatens to cut off his trust funds and later says to his friend i hate him i want him dead br br all is not well in beverly hills this is always an excellent theme i believe this film came out in 1990 right after the menendez killings if you watch a killing in beverly hills and then compare it to this film you may find some interesting parallels
<START> this movie is just plain dumb don't bother watching it believe me you're better off br br long and short of the plot a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children in defending him she comes across a wooden doll of pinnochio she takes the doll home pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people br br this movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending the plot is very bad and the dennis michael musical score is pitiful the story written by kevin s tenney is just pointless and evokes no horror or fear this is a far cry from his work on night of the demons and witchboard which are decent outings but nothing to write home about his directing is ok but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good br br in conclusion 2 out of 10 perhaps the blandest most boring movie i've seen all year
<START> i remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way chinese people were making films at the time they were admittedly inferior question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure the kung fu craze had begun and bruce lee and ''the chinese would soon follow either that or ''the chinese with jimmy wang yu in any case this film was chosen to lead the way
<START> a multi millionaire marries a female doctor he hasn't worked in a day and she is devoted to her profession he sees her off each day something has got to give br br our hero henry fonda finally decides to do something with his life he becomes a salesman in a department store but is soon fired as poorer people need the job in the meantime dr helen hunt barbara stanwyck has given up her practice what's there to do br br kirk fonda buys a bankrupt hospital and the two shall now be happy aiding others while they eke out an existence br br what's with the writing here when annoyed with her husband dr hunt says you've been acting like gestapo this is supposed to be a comedy hogwash br br a very boring tedious film very little going on here
<START> i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out br br while i won't go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an 8 10 for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews br br what i will say is this br br the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible it's as close to a textbook audience grabber as i've ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes br br everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end
<START> the spoof genre which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent no point no fun no originality just a few cheap bucks for the film makers br br it takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double meaning names to be satire to make people laugh any can pick up a cam corder and have some bad acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to get you to laugh hysterically it doesn't work br br that's not comedy however the same old worn out sophomoric jokes ripped off from a middle school washroom done even more blandly than usual are all here if that's not enough there's a running gag of a bus running somebody over so funny right also one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than michael bay again with the same unfunny results a musical bit flops miserably pity carl once apollo creed in the rocky series now stuck with roles in swill like this br br lousy beyond words watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is probably a lot funnier too
<START> a stupid teen supposed comedy that revolves a serious of misunderstanding including but not limited to a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student girlfriend beating a girl loving a gay guy and the straight guy that loves her and bitchy none of the following is funny or even amusing nation lampoon's use to be hilarious back in the day now the name is sadly synonymous with crap and this one is no exception i use to think was kinda cute when she was on boy meets world but it seems she let herself go and yes i know she has a name but into she does anything else worthwhile she'll stay as br br my grade d br br eye candy kati gets topless bliss relies on a body double
<START> this is one of the worst pieces of cinema i have seen in some time this is also my first review so you can tell i must hate this film at lot br br don't get me wrong i like my serious films i don't like hollywood too much i tend to like french italian offbeat us or anything that tries to communicate something sensible br br but this was awful why 1 the plot such as it was was entirely unbelievable even though the director seems to be everything on a feeling of realism br br 2 the main character has nothing to recommend him does he smoke for coolness or to show us his angst for goodness sake this guy is meant to be an ex dodgy mafia lawyer are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet and he smokes so he must have deep personal issues pop psychology at it's best in the final moments i almost cheered as he gets buried in the cement best place for him and i thought that was about the only good scene or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits br br 3 the entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl she was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old old men with a deep and meaningful personality as demonstrated by smoking happens all the time in really bad films that is br br 4 the pace was so leaden i like slow i like careful but this was just deathly br br 5 50 a bunch of other stuff that i really can't be bothered to write br br awful
<START> hood rat is absolutely terrible this is a urban version of willard i just can't believe this movie got made let alone distributed someone in universal studios thought that people would watch and like this movie the only good thing in this is ice t as the landlord he was funny br br the one thing i hate in movies is sped up action once or twice is bad enough but the whole movie is like that every scene transition is some fast motion special effect the director should be banned from making movies forever br br trust me never see this movie
<START> all those that identify this as a simple rip off of 'elephant' are there no other comments that you can make towards the movie on its own merits as an individual film regardless of its apparent similarities to other movies br br all those that question the validity of the movie in terms of its stereotypical characters the obligatory gay the jock the disabled kid etc i'm not sure how long it has been since you were at school but regardless of how amateurish the acting may be the happenings that go one are surprisingly close to what may actually happen br br and all those that disregard the film as being so simple just six teenagers with the regular teenage angst that pushes one over the edge did anyone stop to think and take notice that the girl who took her life wasn't actually one of those six as one comment points out she had screen time of maybe max excluding the final scenes i think the point of the film is not only to make an issue of teenage angst and how far it can take someone but also that it is no apparently obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act suicide
<START> one dark night is a staple in the 1980's low budget horror genre filled with retro puns clothing and scenery transports the viewer to a simpler time when horror films were just that horror br br nothing so intense that you can't understand whats going on the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead well acted by it's stable of scream queens and a fine directorial job by tom whom revels in the time and makes you believe what he's presenting there is no who done it and certainly no big twist at the end it is straight forward and in your face horror from beginning to end with a lot of 80's humor thrown in for added spice i give it 8 simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film but at least there is no cgi perfect film for new fans to the 1980's horror genre or anyone looking to re live a fun night of classic horror bliss
<START> the star is one of about 152 000 000 westerns that john wayne acted in during the 1930s well the number is a bit exaggerated but it seemed almost like this many this is because these b movies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second or lesser feature in a theater most bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep down costs and the star is no exception to save on costs incidental music is not used running times were kept to under an hour the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talents and wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time some of these wayne features are pretty good while others like this one are watchable but also rather silly and inconsequential i enjoyed this film and most of the others but it's probably because i cut bs a lot of slack br br wayne stars as john travers a us marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage this is odd as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it as they used telephones and modern machine guns things you just wouldn't expect to find in the old west such anachronisms are actually pretty common in b westerns as gene autry films for example abound with them wayne's sidekick is yak played by stuntman and real life friend of wayne yakima canutt br br the bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as the shadow and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face this sounds exactly like a character from a movie serial the sort of baddie that kids loved but grownups groaned at because they were so silly and at bit like or dr evil the problem is if you listen to his voice and pay any attention at all it becomes obvious early in the film that this shadow is george hayes now speaking of hayes this is the same guy who later in films was known as gabby hayes but here and in several other of wayne's early films he looks and acts nothing like gabby in the star he was well dressed articulate and clean shaven imagine that in real life apparently this was more the real george hayes though i doubt that he was evil now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film you are left with acting passable and nothing more and stunts which were actually pretty amazing again and again one amazing stunt after another occurred such as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenes all done by the way by canutt and his friends canutt was often john wayne's double in films and this went on for decades the problem with some of the stunts however is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great stumbling horses bits seen later in the film up until about 1940 film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop in the process the horses' legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized one of the worst examples of this was the film jesse james where several horses were brutally killed leading to the american humane association insisting that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to that animals are not hurt in the production so since about 1940 films bear this little disclaimer the star was made well before the disclaimer and i can't see how the horses did these tricks without being killed br br overall this is at best a time passer due to a poor plot occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses i am no bleeding heart but just can't understand this disregard for a poor old animal
<START> thinly cloaked retelling of the garden of eden story nothing new nothing shocking although i feel that that is what the filmmakers were going for the idea is trite strong performance from daisy that's about it i believed she was 13 and i was interested in her character the rest left me cold
<START> this movie is such a total waste of time i can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash oh i would have loved it when i was seven years old i think a seven year old child may have written and directed it br br there's no script no acting just rubbish the best acting is that by the fighting i think i could whip these ninjas and i am not someone you'd consider tough totally unconvincing and did not spark the least bit of interest i was yawning and laughing by the end of the first ten minutes of the film this is one that would turn people away from martial art movies great comedy bad action flick
