<START> i decided to watch this show and give it a go but i found it to be boring and more importantly dull dull br br there is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all dull there is far too much talking and the character just keeps talking on and on and on during a second glance felt like suffocating the characters the banter doesn't work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what is already a crap show i can't believe this show survived past the pilot this seems to be a show which forces the to your parents' line no actual drama exists br br should have stayed a pilot and a pilot alone
<START> i think this show is awesome i love it and i love fabian not in a romantic kind of way but if i was there i would totally support fabian like haley did and the other girls yeah i mean if they're why don't you want to fight them back fabian is the only who have guts to confront people and say what he thinks not just stay and suck it fabian 100 i love haley too because shes like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere and sleep in a warm bed with servants i mean if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do that and fabian too fabian brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thanks i mean he spend money
<START> this movie was advertised as a comedy but was far more serious than the trailers made it out to be don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but was expecting more laughs great performances from robin williams and laura linney worth seeing but don't go expecting to be rolling on the floor the movie left me wondering what it would be like if robin williams character was a real person that was running for president would we elect a comedian i doubt it unfortunately that kind of stark honesty is something greatly lacking today this is a movie that i will be adding to my dvd library as soon as it comes out on dvd the movie has heart
<START> this is an unusual film because although it was made by twentieth century fox because it's one of the few pairings of barbara stanwyck and her future husband robert taylor barbara stanwyck had been making films for many different studios rko paramount and selznick at about the time she made this is my affair but taylor was an mgm contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to fox something studios occasionally did during this era br br the film is interesting because many real life people have roles in the film though the piece is otherwise pure fiction you'll see actors playing william mckinley teddy roosevelt and admiral dewey i can't recall any film with mckinley or dewey in it as a character though i do remember roosevelt from the wind and the lion and a couple other films three cheers for seeing a lesser president in a film as a major character br br the film begins with mckinley taking a young lieutenant robert taylor aside and asking him to be a special agent for him and telling no one not even the secret service that's because the president fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberies all based on inside information so it's up to taylor who is not known for his manly roles especially at this stage of his career to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man br br however there are two serious complications first while he is able to find the gang members one of the gang member's step sister is stanwyck taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities second because mckinley is the only other person who knows the truth serious problems develop when mckinley is assassinated and taylor is on death row for the crimes br br the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context while today most people don't remember mckinley nor remember that he was assassinated the film is set in this interesting time period the acting is pretty decent as the stars are supported by victor mclaglen and brian donlevy though i must admit that role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles overall it's very interesting well written and not too sappy in the romance department a good outing for all
<START> jean claude van damme's movie career seems to have gone to hell in a so how ironic to see him playing a character who meets the same fate in a literal manner at the very start of the movie it's also interesting to note how very very similar the plots of his movies play out regardless of who the producer director or screenwriter are van damme usually plays a character who is living in france then due to a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and it's up to van damme to get revenge helped by a character he's just met look at awol or or many other films that feature the headline starring jean claude van damme and they all feature nearly the same type of story structure this doesn't mean they're identical of course just very similar and if you've seen one van damme movie you've basically seen them all it's the same with maximum risk
<START> bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film the kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are everywhere so much so that you really aren't supposed to see them as human the yawns between the lines from wayans and sandler are extensive indeed they try hard but alas and persona itself does not a good film make jimmy caan plays a nifty villain but he's always had that redneck edge at the ready my favorite's scene is the repeated clips of a tv ad in which caan reveals the virtues of america can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage aside from that it's a buddy movie with guns for brains pass on this one
<START> of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste br br take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle
<START> i haven't read the source richard brooks' novel the brick foxhole which i hope is not as as its title but i understand the original villain was a not an anti semite and to be honest sam levene is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier but okay you have to go with the flow consider 1947 not even anti semitism has been treated on screen yet many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves jews but anti semitism had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant so we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual now that's really unpleasant and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for robert ryan to get away with it we are by no means free of prejudice but we've still come a long way since 1947 br br watching this again for the first time in years i was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie the many shots of two people talking the shadows the time that passes between the question and the answer the uninspired editing but i could live with that because of the film's subject matter and because of a few other things br br one of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is robert ryan's performance the guy does a splendid job at times he can seem thoughtful cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police any way i can help yes sir then alone or with another soldier the simmering hatred rises to the top not so much through what he says but the way he looks that scowl that penetrating stare those dark eyes glittering wow br br the film has taken a lot of heat because of robert young's preachy speech about his grandfather's murder that doesn't bother me at all although i guess didn't have to have young shove his face into the camera while talking about and still taking the context into account it's one of the more shocking moments of the film part of its impact is due to young's almost casual delivery of the message and part of it is due to the not having been heard on screen before br br another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the paul kelly character and his relationship to the whore gloria grahame holy guacamole what elliptical conversation kelly is given to you know what i told you all those things i just told you they're all lies his character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness it's impossible to know what to make of him he adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presence br br it's a moody murky film its people live in the dark and there is murder afoot practically no one screams or shouts the horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems just beneath the surface br br see it if you have a chance
<START> my age 13 br br keats played by damon wayans and archie moses played by adam sandler are the best of friends and have been for a year what moses doesn't know is that keats is really jack carter an undercover cop who is waiting for the right time to bust moses and frank colton a major criminal who moses is involved with when colton and moses find out that keats is a cop colton wants to kill moses but he gets away after shooting carter in the head which does not kill carter moses is found by the cops and is taken for proof of colton's wrongdoing but when the cops including carter are about to escort him across the country on a plane all the other cops are killed and moses and carter are alone in the desert carter has to stay alive as well as take moses in br br a fairly average action comedy bulletproof has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid for a comedy i found most of the jokes entirely unfunny but as an action movie it has a few fairly good action scenes not being a good fan of either adam sandler or damon wayans i found the acting and therefore the characters well below par the climax isn't really great and the film is so unrealistic it is not entirely bad but also not too good and it is far too short running below 85 minutes i though there was another 15 minutes left before it ended but there wasn't and the film felt too short overall not a complete waste of time but i still wouldn't recommend bulletproof br br australian classification ma 15 medium level violence sexual references medium level coarse language br br rating 56 out of 100
<START> the magnitude of the stalingrad tragedy is concisely presented in the end note of the movie in the battle of stalingrad more than one million people were killed in action froze to death or died of starvation russians romanians italians hungarians germans austrians of the 260 000 surrounded men of the sixth army 91 were taken prisoners of whom only 6 000 returned to their homeland years later br br what the story does not tell was that who surrendered did not share all the hardship of the captivity of his men he had a special treatment as the highest ranking taken by the soviet army when during his presence at the nuremberg trials he was asked about the fate of the 91 000 prisoners he declared that they were fine he was freed after the war and died in the east germany br br the film only presents the first part of the tragedy the actual battle of stalingrad however for an entire picture the fate of the 91 000 should also not be forgotten
<START> this is a multi faceted insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient their and our perception and realities although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman the story delightfully flirts with physics medicine religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real konkona sensharma beautifully conveys that the world is living in is as real to her as ours is to us within that world she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world br br here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie don't worry these are not spoilers i absolutely loved the way sen wove these commentaries into the story br br the references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witch doctor in hindi performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the ghosts sitting in brain br br the doctor shock treatment as a solution that is believed to work br br windows of perception the scene about the review of book br br the allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for maya br br news footage of george bush telling the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there are wmd in iraq now that is not as much about bush's perception who i suspect knew the truth as the gullible public's perception about wmd in iraq br br one of the best scenes in the movie is where tells anu charu sent this man to beat me and anu dismisses it as a matter of course konkona did a fantastic job bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash br br sen was bold but not bold enough to pose one big question is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in god she could have inserted some scenes about normal healthy people praying to and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history the ritual exorcism scene doesn't go far enough that would be the ultimate question what is normal who's reality is right the or the br br imho this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than a beautiful mind it looks at the minds of not just the sick person but also the healthy and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world if the former got 4 oscars this deserves more at least one each for story screenplay direction konkona and shabana azmi it was truly a treat to watch this movie and i'm glad i bought the dvd for my collection br br this was a story very well told indeed
<START> this film is about the complicated friendship romance and deceit between two men and two women during the world war ii br br a lot of effort has been put to make the edge of love look the right period however i find this effort too excessive particularly in terms of the tone of the colours most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone it's hard to make out who's who in this tone br br another detrimental point is the fancy use of image splitting lens there are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing such as three keira knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace that simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow instead of being artistic br br as for the plot it is plain boring the way the story unfolds is not engaging at all sienna miller's unstable character is annoying in fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable keira knightley's accent is impossible to understand making it a further impediment to understanding the plot br br i strongly advise avoiding the edge of love unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes nice sets and lighting
<START> i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie to me this storyline is about a man with growth hormonal disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for trying his very best to fit into the society who doesn't seemed to accept him br br he then met someone who treats him with best friend's love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant which is family and spouse love br br and the comedy it's just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows br br and i must admit it made me tear a little
<START> the storyline of the is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong now 50 years old yuko tanaka lives alone and works two jobs Â one as a checkout clerk in a supermarket the other as a doing her daily round on the hills of nagasaki one of her stops is at the house of a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife yoko and used to see each other as school children but after the death of mother and father who it seems were having an affair together their own relationship was destroyed lying in her sick bed yoko knows however that her husband's feelings for the aren't completely gone and for the sake of after she has died she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together br br while the story might be simple the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie the film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of dementia in the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life how they interact with each other on a daily basis how relationships form and how past and present can collide the director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style it's only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written it's all validated by the emotional depths the film touches represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of yuko tanaka
<START> formulaic to the max neither title reflects the serial's actual content fighting nazis in morocco actually the ranch the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights the packaging claims over 40 in 15 chapters that's at least three a chapter aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman watching how much furniture is overturned smashed thrown burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about when the protagonists start fighting you can bet that everything in the room will be in it too so kudos to the fight choreographer who is the real star of this serial br br two positive notes the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights and best of all we have the girl side kick often a journalist as she is here actually participating in the mayhem mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in manhunt of mystery island 1945 on the negative side there are just too many jump out of the way escapes before the slab falls before the car goes over the cliff before the speedboat explodes before the building explodes before the truck hits you etc etc br br it is claimed that this serial partially george lucas to make the first indiana jones film but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development br br rod cameron as a moving rock a role he played in all his films other than watching all the furniture getting smashed there's nothing really going on here compared to other serials that have fewer fights more story better actors and more developed characters br br i give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing
