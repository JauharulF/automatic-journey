<START> well i have been to a british university in fact i went to the one in this very film and it was nothing like that this is a horrible badly made and acted film worst thing is it could have been really good if they bothered to spend more that on it in fact if it really wanted to represent true british students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan it says nothing about uni life where was the bush diving the tea drinking till 4am the endless chats about group dynamics where was the diversity and fun maybe i'm just being romantic but i don't remember week being that awful and i'm and in the end the question still remains a bed or a wardrobe
<START> unlike most reviewers here i hated this movie simply because the writer director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic too many film fans equate self to 'film genius ' but i don't buy into that cult of personality a film should be about its subject not its director unless it's a woody allen film of course spoiler which is just as well save your time there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot long porn star's you know what in the last frame that's actually called a tacky maneuver that screams film school br br the flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience Â which first and foremost is the writer director but the rest of the audience should look down on the surly brutal nature of the porn biz too the flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry looking down on each and every player it could bash no matter just love your writer director love those four minute steadicam segments which are supposed to show the energy of the moment but somehow had all the verve of an off switch love the story no matter how dull it is about the gee whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star but look down on it too of course while the subject has the potential to be fascinating Â innocence money degradation beauty your worshipful writer director somehow managed to make it all look again dull partly because of its run time here is something your auteur hero didn't try giving the characters dimension or soul anything at all to give a hoot about aside from genius that paul is of course but i'm not buying i don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype br br another overlong auteurist hack piece with fifty times more hype than quality i know some of you agree the rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again not my problem
<START> as a rule there are few things more dispiriting than hollywood's attempts to be courageous mixing caution with heavy handedness message movies pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems crossfire is not entirely free from this taint it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious assuming a level of naivity in its audience that's depressing to contemplate as late as 1947 it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti semitism existed and that it was bad it was unthinkable of course for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was victim was a homosexual nevertheless thanks to good writing and excellent acting crossfire remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime br br postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir and crossfire addresses it directly the film is set in washington d c among soldiers still in uniform but idle spending their days playing poker and bar crawling joseph sam levene an intelligent and kindly jew explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive mitchell who is close to a nervous breakdown the weak willed floyd bowers and montgomery a tall overbearing bully who belittles a young soldier from tennessee as a stupid hillbilly the three soldiers wind up at apartment where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive calling his host jew boy is beaten to death and mitchell disappears making himself the prime suspect for the killing br br unraveling the crime are detective finlay robert young dry and by the book and sergeant robert mitchum a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder among the pieces of the puzzle are ginny gloria grahame a nightclub hostess who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key and floyd steve brodie who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house while there is no real whodunit suspense the story remains gripping and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever br br the strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious the cinematography is a striking shadow play with and harsh lights rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke world weariness is as pervasive as noir lighting nothing interests me finlay says quietly to nothing is toast in the nightclub gloria grahame the paragon of noir femininity nearly steals the movie with her two scenes platinum blonde jaded and caustic she's the quintessential b girl poisoned by the stinking gin mill where she works for laughs she says bitterly her sweet face curdling when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted courtyard then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment when he goes there he meets a weasely crumple faced man paul kelly who seems to sponge off ginny and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions gloria blows mitchell's good girl wife off the screen in a scene where she's asked to give mitchell an alibi slim and frail in her with her girlish lisp she lets us see just how often ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp br br robert young is a nondescript actor and he stands no chance against mitchum's charisma but he does a good job of keeping his pipe smoking character saddled with delivering the movie's earnest message this side of mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when he's doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can't take your eyes off him the third robert ryan creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable bigot we see his phony geniality his bullying his resentment of anyone with advantages his am i right or am i right smugness how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them br br message seems cautious and dated now though not nearly so much as the same year's a gentleman's agreement finlay's speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white reminding us that irish catholics were once persecuted next it could be people from tennessee he says or men who wear striped neckties or maybe blacks or japanese or homosexuals or communists the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems it its message by making the jewish victim saintly as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to exonerate the military having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like montgomery and stressing that served honorably in the war still it did take some guts to depict immediately after world war ii an american who might have been happier in the nazi army and the movie's basic premise is still valid if monty were alive today he would have gone out on september 12 2001 and beat up a sikh
<START> i gave soul plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would actually be something of comedic value in it im not black but that does not mean i cant appreciate black comedy i know that because i happen to enjoy watching the wayans bros good times and other series br br i've seen crap movies and im not easily repulsed as for soul plane i didn't even bother finishing it don't know if they managed to land the plane and i couldn't care less it would be unfair to say i didn't find some parts funny as i did laugh but i also laugh at youtube videos of falling on their nuts so that doesn't say much the men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas in mating season looking to get some whenever and where ever possible and we wonder why all those stereotypes don't seem to disappear to summarize soul plane makes the harold and kumar series look like the godfather
<START> when i first saw this on tape about 10 years after it had been released i thought it was one of the better james bond movies however after seeing it again around the turn of the century i was disappointed br br i think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see sean connery end his 12 year hiatus from playing bond that they didn't dare criticize the film i guess what disappointed me was the ending after investing two hours into the film you expect a less hokey more satisfying ending and it may be nitpicking but i was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as miss moneypenny q felix etc br br on the positive side there was plenty of unique action scenes particularly early on and the two villains were interesting i thought klaus maria brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low key and looked the nice guy next door he wasn't your normal bond villain br br this had plenty of skin for a pg movie especially with kim basinger starring never being an actress known for hiding her figure the language was very tame but most bond movies are pretty good in that department br br all in all it's a fair bond and nothing else just because connery is in it it doesn't mean it's automatically good roger moore and pierce brosnan have proved they could play the role well too
<START> br br the last is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of jed victor mature gus james whitmore and pat hogan and their relationships with the army particularly captain guy madison colonel robert preston and corrina colonel's wife anne bancroft hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the indians jed gus and mungo adjust to living the life within a fort on the edge of the last frontier ' jed who has been raised by gus both inspires and looks up to the gus and mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with civilization ' his real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife corrina colonel a reckless man who every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and jed for what he is caught in the middle is captain a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness br br what makes this movie so interesting as well as entertaining is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of the last are exactly the same elements forget the insipid title and dated music br br first the screenplay almost all of the subplots particularly the reckless colonel have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity just when you think you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a different direction possible spoiler the last being a production code' movie back in the day the word virgin' was taboo it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner i expected either jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin i was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending br br second the casting mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of jed the wild eyed innocent raised in the woods' james whitmore who plays gus the man who raised is actually five years younger than mature nevertheless mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time most notably burt lancaster and kirk douglas none could have played jed better preston also mature's junior plays colonel missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man however preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as corrina bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for winona ryder edward scissorhands' and christina ricci sleepy hollow' that is i felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why i believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades further bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though this enables the 24 year old bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the 37 year old preston yep she could be a colonel's wife madison walks a careful balancing act as riordan handling a complex role and sometimes dialogue playing a role similar to that of john wayne in fort madison does a more skillful job at it br br this movie has a type camaraderie that alone makes it worth seeing it also has memorable performances beautiful and great action and direction i just hope a letterbox version is available many have been lost because this movie takes full advantage of that format
<START> man alive is this game bad or what the graphics are way below par even if it were on a playstation 1 never mind a gamecube the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements what a worthless game br br i totally love warner's batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way batman vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to and graphics the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever i really must stress how bad the graphics are don't let the color schemes fool you i've seen better stuff on a commodore 64
<START> okay if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema it wouldn't be particularly worthwhile however in 1898 films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tell instead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities if seen today almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very very short often less than one minute long and so in light of this this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh two guys a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each other falling and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle that's all the film is over before you know it
<START> this movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin and reject the advance of a amoral suitor who brings trouble on the family after seeing the 1999 version and reading the book i decided to watch the older version i found it did stay true to fanny character in the book but it was also boring character fanny character played by le was lackluster she often appeared to be about to faint i also did not like robert who played henry crawford i could not imagine him being interested in fanny or her cousin maria jackie smith wood who played mary crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly i lost interested in her acting and i kept staring at her wig i kept expecting it would drop off her head i could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig
<START> possible spoilers below br br what a long and mostly uninteresting movie who were these characters why didn't i care about them if i'm going to watch a movie for two hours i'd like to care about somebody or something br br we know that salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world beyond that though we learned little about most of his family's hopes fears etc as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown br br and why was lucy even in this movie she said little we knew little about her or what she was doing was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship or what her plans were upon reaching new york to those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman however cultured could not get into this country alone i say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time that point could have been made in five minutes with lucy as a momentary character br br more questions why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family we heard about the brother and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness also how long was the journey from italy to new york given the conditions on the ship it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days someone said something about seeing land a week at one point but i think that was when they were already en route i needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through br br the only scene i really liked was when the boat filled with passengers left the dock br br if you choose to rent this movie do so with remote in hand you may want the fast forward button handy br br finally may i suggest that with the right voice over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside people walking etc this movie might have made an interesting public tv documentary
<START> the plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway how can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of india a story like this writes itself i'll watch most anything but this was unwatchable the sad thing is the white folks are the most colorful in the film vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor and jack was great eye candy but everyone else was so boring jeffrey who was exceptional in my beautiful did what he could but the story was so boring the saving grace was really the background music which made it ok to laugh at the film instead of with the film or not at all there are many other better gay movies ethnic movies just plain movies i give a lot of low budget movies a pass but this shouldn't have been made or should have been made by someone else
<START> du rififi chez les rififi 1955 can on the surface be described as a french variation on john huston's seminal heist film asphalt jungle 1950 the difference between the two films is rififi 1955 pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence also the police aren't involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle in the end rififi 1955 is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle 1950 remarkable noir picture that defines 1950s french cinema br br spartacus 1960 may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist but in my opinion rififi 1955 was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s he got some sort of retribution when rififi 1955 became a success around france and europe thus defying the hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same rififi 1955 is the most important film of dassin's career because it not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance at making films br br jules dassin gave the and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir rififi 1955 marked the end of dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir pictures br br rififi 1955 is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director jules dassin a masterpiece in acting cinematography directing editing and writing not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film masterpieces such as rififi 1955 are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history br br the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the minute duration the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre productions production and post production of a film shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi 1955 is in committing and why very few would do something like it the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture br br lack of unnatural sound in the landmark minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism any dialogue or and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream patience sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down br br maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that's rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films jean and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing the robbery sequence of rififi 1955 reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tension br br many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les 1955 have been influenced if not inspired by it one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melville original choice for director of rififi who used variations of the heist sequence in le 1961 and le rouge 1970 another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing 1956 also quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs 1992 was inspired by this film other film directors influenced are john woo michael mann paul schrader ringo lam etc br br du rififi chez les 1955 is comparable to bob le 1955 in many ways one jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi 1955 and bob le 1955 two each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist three bob le and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion four each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats br br part of charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le jo le mario and cesar le most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal the main characters led by tony le abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is of sam peckinpah and john woo jean becomes the role of tony le with his cynical outlook and tired looks du rififi chez les rififi 1955 became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end
<START> somewhere in usa the young clair manipulates her friends mic billy and john showing a letter that would be sent by bob to her and the group cowardly beats bob and mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest mic feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did but john and billy threaten him with tragic consequences br br i believe the wind is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the awful screenplay is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary since there is no story or plot only sequences of disconnected scenes the amateurish direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible it is unbelievable how producers invest money in such garbage distributors release this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this dvd i waited until the very last scene because i was curious to see how bad this film could be and i was impressed since it is worse than i could imagine in my lowest expectations in the end i question why imdb does not offer zero in the vote system since the garbage really deserves this vote my vote is one br br title brazil invisible force
<START> do you liked dead man don't wear plaid what about top secret and a chorus line well is a fantastic melange of all three of them as unlikely it may seem very funny tongue in cheek movie noir hommage with stunning songs and great dancing you have to have a little odd humor for this movie but it is very well worth seeing it i've voted it a nine if the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten thats how good that movie is
<START> it's along the line of comedy of errors mistaken affection transferring from one to another blossoms and passes cat and mouse flares of passion sparks of fire fanned and put maybe she loves he loves or they circle of emotions evolving yet not to let him know wanting to let her know let them knowÂ good ensemble cast in spite of the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved br br it's a refreshing charmer casual free and easy and rather down to earth not hollywood glamorous like notting hill but lots of human feelings frailty vulnerability a flowing yes all revolving around an accidentally lost found love letter kate capshaw as the owner of the town's bookstore with a variety of characters portrayed by ellen degeneres tom selleck blythe danner tom everett scott gloria stuart alice drummond and geraldine mcewan as the seemingly unaffected mrs romance is in the air love lurking everywhere you get to appreciate the talented kate capshaw the alarmist is another quirky little movie which is fun to watch capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with david arquette and arquette with stanley tucci br br notting hill is satisfying in its story revolving around the glittering pairing of julia roberts and hugh grant and the wonderful support of his circle of london friends love letters is delightful in its quirky small town ness and its story involving kate capshaw's ripple effects on her friends and neighbors both maybe fantasies somehow the latter felt more attainable if it should happen to you and if you appreciate words or poetic lines it could be the movie for you
