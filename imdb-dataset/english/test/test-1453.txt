<START> romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for bellow from average movies and source of frustration for viewers this one is a perfect example of this and got a place in my top ten worst movies br br history is far from creative and jokes are weak i found no reason for a single laugh during all the movie characters are plain and the performance of the actors and just good history develops slowly it's tedious and foreseeable ending is also foreseeable and sugar coated br br this is one that movies you watch in a rainy saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to watch in my humble opinion
<START> the film is very fast moving bizarre and colorful it's like mad max on speed whit tons of and make up also very cartoonish as that said cartoon sequence pops up here and there the plot is also very saucy but i'll believe it's meant too be the thing that really drives me crazy in this movie is the characters they are painfully irritating especially rebecca played by lori petty she's really annoying i'll believe she is the most annoying creature i've ever seen the editing is also annoying very mtv stylized another thing that's missing from tank girl is an exciting adventure the humor isn't much funny either it has some nice visuals though br br however a lot of people love this film most of them are women and that's not weird at all because this movie is all about girl power tank girl this is a real chick flick and the best example of an hate love film
<START> oh man this movie is amazing it's very good it's a story about a man who isn't so accepting of black people he sits at a bar drinks on his night out and he rants about hippies who are anti war and how blacks and hippies don't deserve to get any welfare checks this movie is very realistic because it portrays a guy joe who represented a lot of guys back then and now too the story goes like this joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend and this rich goes to the bar to rethink what he just did and while he's doing that joe is in the bar ranting about hippies and people who are against the war the rich guy accidentally tells joe that he killed a hippie and obviously joe applauds the rich guy cause joe hates hippies amazing movie watch it to see what happens next i liked this movie because it was reminiscent of those days in the early 70's i liked the way movies were shot back then in those days very good stuff it's not like today's movies basically the movie gives you an inner look into the mind of the lead character joe i like the theme of the movie about the working man who's busting his ass trying to make a living
<START> this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market br br you have a young couple in love but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence when the boyfriend goes to jail the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are everyone in this movie except for the cops first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money she becomes brown's property then she's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for br br as if this isn't enough reason to see this movie you also have anthony playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor but he's really a major crack dealer in a sleazy yet hilarious scene he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a hot shower because she stinks are hysterical lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film tarantino bring her back br br it's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this it has just the right blend of comedy action sex romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs jim brown's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's b villain wings hauser in vice squad sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged in the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor
<START> there's no other word for it fox dumped this out with no marketing of any kind nobody in the country other than those who have been looking forward to this film know anything about it all the red flags have flown it has to be a mess it can't be anywhere near as good as office space right wrong though office space it ain't this film definitely has satirical bite and wit it's a misfire on certain levels but who's to blame is left to mystery br br based on what is currently showing in theatres i can say idiocracy is a good movie it's funny sometimes laugh out loud funny it's effective sometimes ingenious what it isn't as far as i can tell is finished we will see something come of this film again whether it's an extended cut or reshoots alone it can be hilarious it's ballsy at times br br leaving the theatre looking around at the mall i was surrounded by advertisements and billboards commercialism and stupidity it's not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984 but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture and there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it anyway go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried
<START> this program is a favorite of our family and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons the title of promised land is very apt as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her it's a god bless america type of program with inspiring stories old fashioned values down to earth characters truthful and encouraging messages beautiful scenery and well written humor and drama it's a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from without worrying about bad language adult themes crudeness violence etc we always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and can't wait to see each one all over again when they're finally released on dvd
<START> i have seen this film on a sunday evening and i must say there is no better way to end the weekend i am totally pleased with the humor and the warm charm this film offers it simply leaves me in beautiful mood watching this film means having a great time and keep a warm feeling br br the film offers sharp black british humor and feels very fresh to me you really enjoy the story and the characters brenda blethyn is so great i don't know exactly why she's too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother but i really feel comfortable when she shows up in the movie br br some may say the story was thin and predictable but who cares there simply has to be a happy end dancing in the sunshine are the characters stereotypes or cut outs i don't know better i don't care i just loved them and enjoyed watching them br br furthermore i must say that i usually don't like romantic comedies but this one is outstanding a black comedy with a heart of gold
<START> the only redeeming scene in this movie is when the robots are sent out to fight style' there was one good spinning side kick and that is the best 3 seconds of the movie unfortunately the rest of the movie has very little to recommend it there are better spoofs out there
<START> i saw bits and pieces of this on tv once and when a friend recommended it i began looking for it even though it seemed no place nearby had it i finally got a hold of it in an antique store and couldn't wait to watch it oh that i had seen it a couple years earlier and could've really enjoyed it i was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long and i think this is what made the plot and story so lacking the plot really does sound like a good one both on the trailer and the movie comments a teenager angus jesse bradford and his newfound stray lab yellow are marooned on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father bruce davison together they manage to survive the wilderness and wait to be found and rescued still what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very rushed there is a possible love interest between angus and sara but they're never shown together for more than a moment yellow is a mischievous dog the parents are reluctant to keep but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip the scene of the mother mimi rogers mentioning vaguely what death is like to the younger boy joel palmer doesn't go anywhere in no time we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island then suddenly it's 14 then 19 of all the animals a castaway could be exposed to in the wild only 1 kind a wolf attacks them why couldn't something else have been a problem instead of having the same type of animal maybe even the same one strike twice there are few views of how angus prepares food except when he discovers fruit and roots and when he a trapped rat if he knows so much about survival skills why weren't more scenes with it shown the one thing that made me blank was why the dog didn't have much part alone when he is rescued and the dog is left behind on the island there is no scene showing how he survives without a human's help i wished i was more open to this when watching it but i did enjoy some of this the acting was good and the score was enjoyable though i found myself wondering why the father looked so much older than his family and why he and the main search and rescue conductor share names this is a good movie for kids but though the protagonist is 14 nobody over 10 would be interested with this
<START> wow i've never seen nor heard of this film it just came on tv 2 00 am and i am in complete awe setup a bunch of rich fat cats are out golfing one knocks a ball into the rough it lands by a ninja a tuxedoed man walks over to pick the ball up the ninja grabs it crushes it in his hand man pulls gun ninja pulls ninja blows dart into gun barrel gun explodes this is just the beginning of the greatness people everyone must see this movie 10 big ol fat stars from trusty
<START> even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings i might of had for the character of max i just can't bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it br br gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world and more crucially gone is director george miller's passion for the franchise the dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third and thankfully last instalment sure the stunts are spot on to be expected by now and of course miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since the road warrior's crowning glory of the petrol tanker pursuit is replicated here only he uses a train instead br br it's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s but when viewing the three films together now thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action and the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly in the context of this series anyway i give the film 3 10 purely for one real good thunderdome fight sequence while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least but this is the third time i have tried to like this film and as glutton for punishment as i undoubtedly am i wont be trying again ever
<START> in a minute to pray a second to die clay mccord alex cord is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy br br realizing his days as an outlaw are numbered he wants desperately though somewhat reluctantly to take advantage of an amnesty being granted by rough and tumble territorial governor robert ryan excellent performance who badly wants mccord to renounce his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others while in the bandit hub of outlaw mario plans to kill mccord to stop that from happening br br also starring arthur kennedy aldo and a slew of other familiar european faces this is co written and produced by american spaghetti western pioneer albert band also responsible for the pre leone film gunfight at red sands br br though the solution to the main character's epilepsy is lifted straight out of howard hawks' el dorado the script is solid pretty fresh and unpretentious this has a great balance of action and story and alex cord is great in it he really should have been a bigger star br br in defense of the shorter well dubbed english version personally i'm past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where mccord is ironically gunned down by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon is needlessly nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message about hope and redemption br br call me old fashioned but i rooted for mccord and felt he earned that happy ending
<START> if i was still 5 i might find it scary it is i guess a low budget film the acting is not good but could be worse the filming and special effect is awful the story line is thin and not worth to dwell on too much time is used on boring shouting scenes the chases or fight with aliens remind me of kids fighting with scary masks on some gore with blood and body parts would scare a 5 year old kid i guess apparently scare the crap out of some of the persons in the film br br it is far from reaching anything like the film tremors br br this turns out to be an incident and we see alien ships nearby earth it make you wonder if any will make a sequel
<START> and totally non scary film the characters doesn't interest at all and most of the time is spent in a car the dog is at best ugly never really scary to interest a more threatening menace would have been needed at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you and not the least something interesting must happen something unexpected as it is this film just drags on and on in what seems like forever maybe a saint bernhard was not that smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and society br br in most scary movies thrillers mystery just whatever genre there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens here you really don't care you just wait for it all to stop and wondering if it wouldn't be better to see something else one of the weakest king adaptations
<START> the trouble with this sort of lyrical film making is that you either make a masterpiece or a lemon there's little middle ground putting it gently this is not berlin symphony of a city or man with a movie camera unfortunately it's not much to look at either br br the problem with this one is that it's glib and half baked as if michael moore had come on board it doesn't really have anything to say or rather to show us with pictures and sounds uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis this is just a patchwork in search of a point though quite inadvertently the movie tells us more about the mind of uncle sam than it intends there is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti technology anti civilisation anti media movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology 'do as i say and not as i do' you just gotta love the yanks eh tonally there's something sour and misanthropic about this episode both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration this time the tone is consistently glum it simply doesn't work over this duration as gustav will tell you br br stylistically naqoyqatsi is a mess the digital stuff is particularly misguided it gives the whole thing a totally fussy look and it also undermines the 'realist' nature of the footage' i mean i pity the guys part of the joy of was that it was a homage to the use of optical film but now optical film's an historical artifact they have to 'take on the digital domain but i don't think they bring it off the digital stuff often looks like video links from cnn or bbc world and with the found footage well the digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just silly and the false colour and solarisation kept me thinking of br br ahem br br james bond title sequences br br ahem odd as it may seem there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by yo yo performance it's about as unobtrusive as a lawrence olivier voice over the images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma br br philip glass himself is on odd form never expected him to knock off the verdi requiem made me laugh which of course is not the desired response to any part of this movie there's even one piece of music that sounds like perhaps they've changed his pills br br from our department is geoffrey actually a hopi indian at all or did he just do a in hollywood hills oh and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier 'episodes' in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies too are part of the global media slushy
