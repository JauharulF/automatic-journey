<START> wow just wow there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing whoo boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems here br br 1 why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive the film acts as though you just can't be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they ever so briefly touch on this in the film i e the bible doesn't say there is aliens well the bible doesn't say there isn't but the actual rebuttal is never answered the bible really doesn't say there isn't so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them br br 2 how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences what if it's something else entirely too bad the film makers already have their minds made up br br 3 the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult that's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present i'm not necessarily arguing that they don't but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up br br 4 why does the other reporter not the greasy haired blonde guy the other one always have his hands in his pockets it's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool br br i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their faith message to care much about make a thought provoking movie as a christian myself this saddens me
<START> i am appalled and dismayed that the network has canceled talk show with spike br br what is wrong with the fox television network canceling talk show with spike and replacing it with wanda sikes for those at the network with a short attention span wanda at large was canceled because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience cringe and wanda sykes spewing out her very own brand of vindictive mud slinging jokes is not humor it is nasty and repulsive br br apparently the fox television network has rewarded wanda sikes because she has garnered a self important appearance front of president obama there is no doubt that wanda's recent ill tempered in front of the president of the united states are not funny and the audience laughter was only to patronize and please obama br br talk show with spike has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer spike's well rounded personality always gleefully poked fun of life and himself and his filed pieces during the first two seasons with aftra actress mary mae atwill as the mae west of the 21st century were absolutely hysterical with spike skits judge joe brown trading spouses and last season's james lee episode where spike chats with erica via the internet on the show br br despite the network's budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and the second season's wga strike spike did not his sense of humor or show integrity talk show with spike always had up in coming new talent and his comedy for stoners spoofs of nanny 911 and idiot paparazzi were considered cutting edge and had excellent production value br br on a professional level spike was the best executive producers and set producer brett webster along with his fabulous production crew were one of the best production teams that i have worked for in my aftra career it would really be very foolish and sad shame to cancel talk show with spike br br unfortunately its success could conceivably be taken to comedy central or another network and financially speaking that would become a valuable revenue loss for fox television br br on behalf of the late night saturday fox television audience supporters of talk show with spike including all cast and crew we beseech the network to retain the talk show with spike franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful fox show
<START> co scripted by william h macy from arguably donald e westlake's best and hardest to find novel a travesty very faithful to the story the movie stars macy as a hapless man who gets in way too far over his head after attempting to cover up an accidental death costars adam arkin and james cromwell in good supporting roles the strength of the movie is in the intricate twist after twist storyline and in the acting particularly by macy who routinely and delightfully breaks through the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time a good storyline with much dark humor this one engaged me enough that i've watched it three times in the week since it came out prepare to your critical faculties and emit a loud
<START> i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you you are alone is that movie for me the film is constantly in my head and in my heart i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if i am seeing it for the first time br br there is nothing i did not like about the movie amazing soundtrack the ending was perfect very emotionally stirring it was compelling and riveting br br i adored jessica and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed i admired strength what a strong woman br br the tag line is when your darkest moments come to life we never know what we are capable of doing everyone says oh i would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part br br thank you for a perfect piece of art
<START> this the the final feature film that michelangelo antonioni directed with the help of wim wenders and adapts from his short story collection that bowling alley on the beyond the clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be accustomed to from his earlier works and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via wenders' directed scenes involving john the director character however most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an antonioni movie while narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place br br nonetheless all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight perhaps due to the lack of time since they're short stories anyway to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship br br the first story story of a love affair that never existed tells the romance between silvano kim rossi stuart and carmen who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel and later meet at a cafe it's as if fate is playing games on them when they meet but part and meet again much later but like the games people play it's almost like a l'avventura or a la notte with the lack of communication and of the expectations from the man br br john director character takes central role in the next short who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop played by sophie she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him and in what i thought was to scare him off tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics br br the next short don't look for me is the longest of the lot with peter weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress chiara caselli or his wife played by fanny ardant perhaps the more star studded of the lot with jean reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists but unfortunately reno's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic there was a key element adapted from l'eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting if there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon it'll be the duplicity of man br br in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la notte marcello mastroianni and jeanne moreau where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert finally we have the final shot this body of dirt with vincent perez as a young man going after a girl irene jacob whom he just met and falling in love with her only to realize that it is a love that is too late it's a relatively talkie piece just like the first story with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in which sort of brings to mind richard linklater's before sunrise br br while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the excuse to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film
<START> the crew of an american submarine discover it's hell below while fighting in the adriatic in 1918 br br although nearly forgotten this excellent war film still delivers solid entertainment thanks to a literate script superior performances and highly believable action scenes br br robert montgomery walter huston play submarine officers under the stress of war who quickly are at odds with each other with dramatic and tragic results since montgomery is in love with huston's daughter madge evans in a well played role the situation becomes even more complicated both on shore and beneath the waves the viewer is torn between the two strong characters one of whom is governed by his heart and the other by the rules br br robert young makes an effective appearance as montgomery's buddy sterling holloway creates a brief vivid portrait of a doomed seaman br br eugene pallette as the torpedo master jimmy durante as the cook make for a very funny comedy team and provide the story with plenty of laughs durante's nose comes in for lots of ribbing and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with british br br movie mavens will recognize babe london as an obese italian miss maude eburne as the wife of a british admiral paul porcasi as an italian admiral all uncredited br br mgm has given the film absolutely first class production values with the undersea sequences especially well produced both the claustrophobic of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately portrayed other moments of unexpected drama montgomery miss evans caught on top of a stalled ferris wheel during an air raid and hilarity durante boxing a kangaroo are expertly threaded into the fabric of the movie to provide a totally satisfying viewing experience
<START> i am seldom motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie in the case of comanche moon i was so uninspired i felt the need to warn others how bad this tv mini series is here are a few thoughts br br the indians they came across like they were in a saturday night live skit making fun of how indians talk when writes dialogue in his novels it reads so interesting i am not sure how they ended up with what they got br br gus looks like from the old gunsmoke series acting is ok and the mannerisms from robert duvall's are right on but the look is pure comedy cowboy br br clara maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat on her next time ever been in austin in the summer before air conditioning i promise you women did not look like that do you think they never saw any episodes of br br gov elisha again whenever they are in the governor's office it feels like a saturday night live skit and the skit is bombing br br woodrow call call is the most reasonable character of course he talks so little how can you screw up that but hey what about that hat br br blue duck see above and include the fact that he isn't even a tiny bit scary they should have gotten javier bardem to play the part br br the rangers right out of o brother where art thou i expected george to come riding up and them to break into a song br br perhaps i am premature because the miniseries isn't completed but i doubt i will watch any more of it any way br br i would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate the enthralling feel of lonesome dove but i watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all
<START> after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down however after i got my region 1 dvd the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas i was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get bogged down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater i recommend this movie to one and all br br
<START> a moderately interesting start some pretty scenes in sixteenth century japan and a promising idea but the execution the comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death really a specialist in oriental history who doesn't speak any japanese walks on without removing her shoes and is generally dumb as celery please this looks like a student film the sets are risible the acting except perhaps for the title character close to wooden the plot utterly arbitrary at least cannibal women was funny this is best watched with someone who knows something about japan just to watch disbelief repeatedly crawl across their face
<START> years ago i caught a fairly well made tv movie entitled linda it was made in 1973 and starred stella stevens in the femme fatale title roll imagine my surprise when over ten years later i once again saw the same story unfold on late night tv however it was this 1993 version starring virginia madsen don't get me wrong i can handle remakes even obscure ones but this badly written and poorly filmed retread made me feel sorry for both madsen and co star richard thomas unlike the original the dialogue here is cliched making me wonder why did they bother to re write it second the camera work is very heavy handed and the the film stock is poor at times i felt reminded of the student film competition at the beginning of christopher guest's the big picture finally the cast looks either bored madsen or suffering thomas in fact the only one who seems like he's really enjoying the work is ted mcginley of course with his perfectly hair and capped teeth he's really stretching himself from his previous work on the love boat bottom line to borrow a critique from opus the penguin in bloom county br br this movie does for film what jonestown did for kool aid br br
<START> i'm really disappointed by this piece of work it is quiet shallow keeps repeating itself is mostly not exact and sometimes on the verge of being wrong i think it's made for elementary school especially because it keeps repeating itself over and over again while leaving large gaps a young kid might actually enjoy it and learn from it but a better way to make a kid appreciate theoretical physics are books like a short history of time or the tao of physics if you are familiar with the topic on a very basic level you won't gain any new information or views from this series don't waste your time with it nice eye candy though
<START> the commenter before me stated this movie is the worst that was ever forced upon him her as a child i have to say though that i loved this movie when was little and i still love it today the movie has the best running theme of all family togetherness considering the time period the movie was released i thought the movie was acted out well i only wish i could still find a copy of it somewhere of all the 1980's films i watched as a kid this was on of my favorites i know i probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and my mom i would definitely recommend it to anyone i know or don't know so if you do find a copy of it i suggest watching it it's wonderful and heartwarming
<START> well what can be said about a horror comedy that features neither horror nor comedy there are no characters in the film but much too many plot lines all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous br br the computer generated creatures look bad a bit like disney versions of oversized rats without a tail the walking dead are the biggest rip off apart from the title the shall look like the dead in movie but are far removed they just look like bad actors with of plastic and bull's blood added br br two plot lines really showed some promise the love story and the company story but failed as miserably as the director the writers the sfx department the production and the actors
<START> i'll start by confessing that i tend to really enjoy action movies military or other i'm a guy but this dreck was awful i saw it for free showtime or hbo and still feel i paid too much it was a prolonged episode of general hospital br br i gave it a 1 only because 0 or 0 1 was not possible how or why 59 others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 boggles my mind unless they are all family of the cast or crew br br it might be this movie was so bad many bailed out and as such were too to bother br br i'm sorry for repeating but the 10 line minimum seems silly for what essentially boils down to a warning in hopes of saving others the 2 hr black hole this movie represents trust me stare at a blank wall they'll be more action
<START> a recommendation gloria grahame runs the kind of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call that the orphanage is strapped for cash we know because gloria puts all the orphans to work and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go round especially for the older nubile female orphans age range appears to be 12 30 ish the new arrival however turns out to be more than a match for gloria and has indeed just taken out her own mother mother's lover in a witty claw hammer and arson opening scene predictably gloria ends up on a meat hook herself this one was made for about but was is a huge huge huge hit on the grindhouse circuit my dvd cover promised disturbing and politically incorrect scenes and it sure wasn't lying i believe it is regarded as the citizen kane of orphanage set torture porn movies 4 10
