<START> firstly the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie it started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him even his attempt to tell the police failed which just added to the annoyance value there were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile the plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure the ending was nothing short of hey we've run out of budget let's stop it here now if i'd written a novel that ended this way i'd top myself trash trash trash
<START> i of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other lion's gate extravaganza so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing and it is to a point a young college student sarah is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game now that's fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer like myself will most likely become frustrated characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why sarah knows them or is hanging out with them all of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's all part of the design in reality it's all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance 4 out of 10
<START> that was a waste of 9 dollars the movie was terrible all the scary parts were pointless and sadly repetitive seemingly all of the tense parts could be completely predicted and did not seem to hold any bit of the audiences attention also the plot line didn't advance at all during the entire movie and it was all just a big setup for the grudge 3 when it seemed like the movie was about to make a big plot advancement it turned out just to be a pointless scene these directors need to follow hitchcock's example every scene has a point 90 of the scenes in this movie could have been left out with no change of the plot final opinion don't waste your time energy or money
<START> everything this film tried to do is done better and superbly in run lola run the red haired hip cutie the critical deadline s the lover in jeopardy and the crime pays sometimes message but unlike lola it just isn't believable or well put together it is a labored knock off that might have worked for me if i had seen it before lola but it pales in comparison yes the falling beetle was nice but that was about the only surprise in the film do yourself a favor and see the real mccoy and the real hip red head in run lola run
<START> the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep or not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears the dialog is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio if you're thinking about purchasing this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in 1973 also the vhs copy of this film under the title of when taekwondo strikes looks better than the dvd but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing where is the original camera negative
<START> crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman's agreement which it beat to theatres by a few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying it's because i'm jewish isn't it it's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the brief featurette on the warners' dvd doesn't mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti semitic one but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish there's little doubt in sam levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay Â not a mincing caricature but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper's confused soldier there's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy br br there's an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere is pure rko noir set over one long sweltering night the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laid back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert young's like detective gloria grahame's tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties but the lasting impression is of robert ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row a big surprise hit in 1946 as a reward and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac which itself had a notable tendency to target jews so much for
<START> i love comedies and i love independent films but this was much too slow and the humor was extremely regional i guess it would have been better if the main characters were likeable but they were just typical gen x slacker types just like the people that have been causing trouble in high schools for forty years i can understand high praise for a young indie film maker when it is deserving but this is an extremely average film
<START> the beginning might be a spoiler br br the eye 2 is the sequel to the eye it's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her br br the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled br br the eye has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas the eye 2 is a forgettable horror cum drama film omit watching this watching the eye is good enough
<START> i generally loved the carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful there are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced there is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others june whitfield kenneth williams jaques and peter butterworth are fine but barbara windsor looks tired and sid james is just tacky joan sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful charles hawtrey its just plain sad when you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch the homophobia of the movie is nasty and its a very unpleasant experience the set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in england the sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here it looks like a cheap production you will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series
<START> in the sweltering summer of 1958 the deuces a gang of brooklyn toughs find their turf threatened when the leader of a rival gang the vipers is released from prison leon stephen dorff the leader tries to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep the vipers out but when his brother brad falls into a sultry and dangerous relationship with annie fairuza balk the sister of a viper and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked leon and his gang are plunged into an all out war to save his brother his girl and his neighborhood according to the dvd sleeve description this is definitely no basketball diaries br br think of it as west side story getting hit over the head with baseball bats and steel pipes having left brooklyn with the dodgers deuces wild has some cool hollywood sets 1950s cars and soundtrack songs and much of it is nicely photographed by john a alonzo the story and direction never get beyond these strengths which enables the film to peak during its opening minutes and proceed downhill the cast looks good when you read the credits but translates into an ageing flabby mess of phony blood and and one fright wig a sense of sadness and regret permeates the production br br deuces wild 5 3 02 scott stephen dorff brad fairuza balk frankie
<START> the first feature length adventure of jim henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as kermit the frog leaves his carefree swampy surroundings for the bright lights egged on by stranded hollywood agent dom deluise who overheard him singing on the way he meets fozzie bear a pitiful stand up comedian at james coburn's el cafÃ© who has telly savalas for a bouncer and madeline kahn a patron the piano playing dog rowlf bestial drummer animal and his laid back funky band egomaniacal beauty queen miss piggy in a ceremony presided over by elliott gould and edgar bergen etc all the while kermit et al are pursued by burger magnate charles durning and reluctant acolyte austin pendleton sold cars ice cream and balloons to by respectively milton berle bob hope and richard pryor served food by insolent waiter steve martin nearly brainwashed by mad german scientist mel brooks and finally land an audition in the offices of movie mogul orson welles who has cloris leachman for a secretary the pleasant song score comes courtesy of paul williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at el for the record i have recently acquired four of the subsequent muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due
<START> this is not direct cinÃ©ma as a matter of fact it is its opposite second installment of filmmaker gypsy trilogy this french work produced by michÃ¨le ray gavras is a film masterpiece not pure documentary no fiction by any means instead has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain wherever the rom people have a strong presence and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the gypsies live sing dance struggle and have survived the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the rom tribe is of indian origin mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the hebrews so in a way it comes as no surprise that they were also persecuted by the nazis but above any anthropological argument this is a work of great beauty strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing
<START> it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened br br the is peopled by such a miserable untrustworthy amoral spiteful unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined everyone is stabbing someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being stabbed cuckolded or swindled nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day it's hell with cockney accents br br i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse they might be living in br br apart from the above as a representation of london's east end it is pure hokum the programme makers have evidently never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque and this pretty well defines the racial majority of the population white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more ten healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation eight of them are dark skinned br br what's more i used to work with a bunch of anglo saxon dare i say cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i've never had each day was like an oswald moseley rally they couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene and were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated upon sex organs and their application alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison br br any programme that purported to represent london's native east end caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast even after the 9 o clock watershed imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful br br i don't know how such a soap opera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic with cockney accents what's the point of that br br dull dreary unrelentingly and ethnically preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation br br avoid it like the plague
<START> having seen other bollywood flicks with salman khan in them i can say this is my favorite of the more recent ones the songs are all quite fun especially 'o priya o which seems to have a nice mix of beatles indian music and dare i say this a bit of prince the love stories are a bit more believable than say chal mere bhai the occasional focus on use of alcohol is at times troubling as it doesn't really seem to make sense to me but it's played well by khan although his voice does become squeaky when he's portraying drunkenness
<START> i never thought i would absolutly hate an arnold schwartzeneggar film but this is is dreadful from the get go there isnt one redeemable scene in the entire 123 long minutes an absolute waste of time br br thank yu br br jay harris
