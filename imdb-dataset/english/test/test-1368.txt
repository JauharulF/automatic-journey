<START> well the movie is basically about the last days of a specific russian regiment stationed in before the main troop withdrawal in 1985 the movie accurately portrays the grim realities of russian army that have made it infamous officers and ncos physically harassing beating and humiliating younger recruits mixed character of war you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next life of women at the front lines documentary footages of helicopter assaults and coffins being and sent home in heave c 130 hercules class russian cargo planes with to jam stinger missiles fatigue boredom anti war sentiment emotional side simply put the there's some action scenes but they are poorly done and often are illogical like major suicidal walk and turning of his back to 10 year old kid armed with ak 47 who's father he just killed also the fact that in the middle of firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out of nowhere and any half bright person knows that it's virtually impossible to hump 40 50 launcher on the march anyone but at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair where murder is sometimes condoned wanton destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during war some food for thought as to why afghan war as lost not the best war movie made but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching
<START> i can't really criticize this film it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals fortunately seeing it again years later it held up fairly well rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths no one believes him including his best friend played by cesar romero whose brother was among those killed and rod cameron was the only survivor the film was shot in india and has some good scenery the acting is on a high level i don't believe rod cameron cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance the mammoths when they finally arrive are fairly effective the ending also has an unusual twist particularly for a 1950's science fiction film definitely worth seeing
<START> this a haunting piece of work its only ten minutes long but i would sooner pay ten bucks into the cinema to see this than to see any full lenght movie currently doing the rounds it is a simple piece of a man's reflection he arrived a young man in this place and was mesmerised by a room and the music coming from it and now here he sits dying in old age in this place he so fondly connects to his youth the music in it is brilliant the guitars have that jazz room twang like neil young's music in dead man if you get the chance watch this film its worth it if rutger hauer made more films like this i think he would get more respect than he gets at the moment you hear him put under phrases like everybody's favourite psycho im sure that is not what rutger would want to be as an actor for he also directed this film so in this shows that he a very artistic actor director a change from the b grade movies he has been doing since the early 90's i hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is one of my favourite actors
<START> another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is i especially remember the scene when brian says he's to quit touring and the other boys calls him traitor i didn't happen like that and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over reacted a movie about the beach boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway the sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group hard core fans like myself knew that this isn't the entire true story and that's why i gave it a low rating 3 however it is the best movie about the beach boys i've seen so far that says quite a bit about the other movies if you want the truth i recommend the documentary endless harmony
<START> if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time in places sure of course it is and proud of it it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that br br big production values simple telling with creative shots it is not complex is a very nice and remarkably sweet film it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton and i bet his son gets that br br the build up is slow enough to be enjoyed the conflicts feisty and the british vs americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore i have minor gripes the score wants to be james horner but is too overblown and there are too many close ups and panning shots for 2005 but if you want a straightforward decent and good looking sports film then this is it br br so here's the thing and i feel like i know my film but i actually liked it more than which is a better film but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable thanks bill
<START> i don't want to seem too much of a nitpicky but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler caused such an enormous change in the timeline how could that be since the butterfly would have been incinerated by the blast of the erupting volcano anyway and how could time travelers keep going back to the same moments and not keep meeting up with their prior and later selves who were also at those same few minutes in the timeline it seems there would have been quite a large crowd standing in front of that dinosaur charging br br while i can accept the idea of a time wave i seriously doubt the wave would have caused only a few changes as the wave passed all changes that would have happened would have happened at once during the passage of that wave so scratch the idea of the city starting to become overgrown with jungle and why jungle at all the location of the city would have still been at the latitude and it was before and would have had vegetation appropriate to its geographic place on earth br br and an endless list of other illogical inanities br br this flick is a weird combination of some fairly decent production values and totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors br br too bad a terrific story idea that was botched up with silly science br br sigh why why why why why spend all that money on production and not even bother to proofread the screenplay to see if it made some sort of actual sense
<START> this film isn't supposed to be funny but it made me laugh br br it isn't designed to be sad but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes br br it isn't written as action adventure but my pulse raced more than once br br just like life this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel it simply is and you react br br if you don't find it funny or sad or moving i suspect that says more about you than the film br br it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human and embrace that we are all trapped here doing this life thing over and over for as long as we must br br tomorrow is another day
<START> i think one true thing is one of meryl finest movies to date her depiction of a dying woman is perfect i have recently lived this movie and it touched me on more levels than i could have imagined meryl is truely the greatest actress to have ever walked the earth
<START> a sincere tribute to suzy parker who's just passed away not only is one of the cheesiest movies ever made but miss parker's performance is in this cheesy movie lover's opinion among the worst performances of all time her last scene is especially overplayed i loved it
<START> though i saw this movie about 4 years ago long before i started commenting on imdb i decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now i often reviewed something just after seeing it what can i say well the best performance is that of the late peter boyle as the title character who after finding out about a man's killing the drug dealing boyfriend of his daughter wants to bond with him even though he's a madison avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower class conservative joe in fact there are plenty of funny scenes of joe at this guy's party making smart alecky remarks there oh and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after on some drugs is none other than susan sarandon making her film debut this was a pretty hard hitting movie for the time it was made late '60s early '70s and was compelling work from scripter norman wexler later of saturday night fever and director john g later to do save the tiger rocky and the karate kid certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time p s among the cultural artifacts seen here are a raggedy ann doll a box of ritz crackers a bottle of heinz ketchup and unique for the era a nixon poster asking would you buy a used car from this man
<START> i find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating it is arguably one of the best comedies ever made and surely the best bollywood comedy of the 90s the film did not do too well on the box office and people had diametrically opposite reactions after seeing it my guess is most people didn't expect it to be an all out comedy and were expecting a regular movie if you love comedies this is a must see and aamir khan is outstanding
<START> this movie sucks the acting is worse than in the films we made when we were 10 years old with a camcorder the effects look like some 80's computer game and the plot is worse than terrible even the worst van damme movies make this look crappy the accent and speech rhythm of the 'bad guys' is so bad it's funny br br i wouldn't recommend watching this unless you are a big time fan one of the actors 1 out of 10
<START> i get the feeling that lisa krueger is easy to overlook i personally found her first film 1996's manny and lo to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful with special credit to mary kay place the film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished one or two critics really liked it but many viewed it as slight krueger's second film committed was released this year 2000 after nearly two years of delays and it similarly vanished and once again critics dismissed the film as slight and pushed the film aside at most praising heather graham's screen presence but rarely her acting ability and once again for me committed is a solid success i feel as if krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldn't be so easily ignored simply because she works on a very restrained br br the title has several meanings but mostly it refers to graham 's refusal to let her husband carl luke wilson flake out and leave her she follows him from new york to el paso and becomes one of the most appealing stalkers in recent cinematic history her respect for her marriage vows leads her to mexican mysticism and self discovery and yep the plot is just that simple and thus just that easy to ignore br br of course is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate nearing fifty percent and for me her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deceit is fairly intelligent and powerful confident in the belief that people just don't have enough faith in each other inevitably has to discover that her beliefs aren't in with those of society at large several comments her have referred to her character as one dimensional and i'm afraid that that's a simplistic reading of the film or perhaps even a misreading if were just an innocent she wouldn't be interesting at all it's the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the normals that makes her so interesting sociologically she's a complete deviant br br krueger sometimes falls into moments of cutesy dialogue and her direction of this film has a rather odd over reliance on shots of clouds moving across the el paso skyline however her mistakes are fairly rare and in this film as in manny and lo it's the performances that carry the day graham has never been better because she's never had a character as perfectly tailored to her as for the first time in her career graham seems comfortable playing an adult even one in slightly arrested development she carries the film perfectly luke wilson and casey affleck as brother both have a number of fine moments as do alfonso as a mexican mystic and mark ruffalo and t bo the slightly psychotic truck driver as in manny and lo the characters are part of their environments well detailed totally organic creations these characters may sometimes seem pointlessly quirky but they make sense in their context even goran visnjic as an artist turned on by devotion fits in in some strange way even though his character's is never discussed br br for me this is a movie that gains depth looking back another commenter here spoke of the stereotypical mexican portrayals and again i'm tempted to call that a misreading is looking for self justification she knows that her commitment is out of control but she's looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make sense of herself character understands that most people don't believe in him and he plays up his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him br br i guess i can understand how this movie could be viewed as underwhelming i'd simply disagree it's consistently funny frequently hilarious and all of the characters exude a warmth which is quite wonderful br br i'm giving this one a 7 5 10 and when i log in the vote here that'll go up to an 8
<START> i believe that this is a heart tugging film richard donner directed the top grossing film superman had done a great job directing this film some of the were good and several were horrible because bobby was by the king baldwin and especially their dog shane attacked the king which meant that he paid for what he had done to bobby br br elijah wood portrayed a good role in this film the memorable scene in this he dreamt that he took the advice about bobby being battered lorraine bracco pre soprano had portrayed an impressing role br br i give this film out of four
<START> greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes is based on the classic book tarzan of the apes by edgar rice burroughs and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book the film has some great scenery like the jungles of south africa to the greystoke mansion the acting is also great lambert did a great performance as tarzan it was also his first english speaking role the film has some funny moments sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic br br the film sees a boat crashing in the jungles of south africa and some time later they have a son named john the apes go into the hut and one of them kills the father the apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own as the years go by john grows up and learns to be more like the apes in his teens his foster mom gets attacked by native hunters and soon killed by them years later a group of people are going to africa on a expedition after setting up camp they're soon attacked by the natives most escape but capitaine phillippe is left behind injured by some of the arrows after hiding he meets john now an adult who takes him to his home and takes care of his wounds after a while phillippe starts to teach john how to speak english and teach him that he's not one of the apes but a person when phillippe goes to leave john goes with him after sometime they arrive at greystoke manor where the sixth earl of greystoke is shown his long lost grandson john is shown his bedroom and picture of his true mom and dad john also meets jane porter and slowly as they get to know each other he begins to have feelings for her when it's christmas the sixth earl of greystoke slides down the stairs killing himself john then starts to miss the jungle and wants to return but phillipe tells him to stay since everything they had done would be for nothing john is then torn between his life as a greystoke and the lord of the apes br br greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes is a great classic that should be seen 10 10
