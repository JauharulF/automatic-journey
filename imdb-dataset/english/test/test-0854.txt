<START> this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever we taped it off the t v years ago and i've watched it about 30 times over the years i hadn't seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie i'm not lying i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie truly tears your heart out even if you don't have children
<START> or backtrack as it is sometimes called is not very good that is it's bad jodie foster had already won an oscar at this point why did she agree to do this i don't know br br the hostage kidnapper relationship is not believable even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life br br worst of all this film features a scene where hopper and foster ride a boat under the bridge a bridge in seattle which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open i've had to wait for that bridge to go down many times almost all of them on the bus it's not a pleasant wait this film caused unnecessary bridge waiting and the world is a worse place for it

<START> i am a glutton for b movies i love the old drive in fare like this movie this film made for very little money it seems does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail it is cheezy it is gory it has no real plot but it entertained me for an hour and a half i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth and one gross out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out but there is also loads of zombies and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre and a demon possessed scarecrow i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people it has great camera work and some cool editing tricks this one is more original than the first bloodbath and the undead look better but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high don't expect romero just second rate fulci i would say that horror fans will like it and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through b movie land
<START> i saw on broadway and liked it a great deal i don't know what happened with the film version because it was dreadful perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen anyway i couldn't wait for this film to be over the acting is universally over the top only kevin spacey has it together and he seems like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out
<START> featuring some amazing and wonderful characters a new mythology superbly designed and executed sets is a great film br br sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity br br perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film br br none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre br br a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting br br another idea would be the foundation of the new perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus
<START> up front if you're tired the first hour could be slow the set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace unhurried giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline the turn of events will keep you hooked how will things turn out what will happen to our precious portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran czech actor how will his wife wonderfully played by stella treat him what happens to dear friend ed played by stanislav a matching sidekick to and the son with selfish hidden agenda blind to the kindness of his parents sigh br br vladimÃ­r sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor preserving the insightful script by jirÃ­ thanks to clear subtitling i was able to notice for every phrase wife utters there's a hint of showing buried in between the lines and so did the judicious lady judge observed is '76 going on 80' and the affection of their enduring endearing marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments his playfulness can be infectious br br this is 'growing old together 101' for at least the beyond fifties and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted one may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the is a means to an end so to speak the film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can hint there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll br br we're fortunate to be able to see an occasional czech film the kolya father son's 2001 dark blue world was revealing with pathos it's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem its subtitles scenery melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances autumn spring aka is available on dvd enjoy
<START> in the middle of the hole i e mailed a friend of mine to summarize it not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures i felt a little un easy recommending it but then i saw the ending it's perfect i've been living in korea for 6 months and this film could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any asian metropolis as it takes on here it uses the myth of hong kong musicals the same way godard or hartley use western musicals but takes it to an extreme it's gritty world and occasionally kafka esquire logic make it all the better i really feel like the closest comparison is hal hartley's surviving desire but have a kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely metaphorical films anyway this is what i wrote to esther hope you like the hole too br br hey br br watching a move called the hole taiwanese i think seems a bit to weird for china unless it's hong kong it's worth seeing so far it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex the guy's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure and pain of a rather intense crush there's also a kinda zombie virus sub plot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doo sequences worth a look
<START> it is an interesting fact that metaphysics by and formal logic and abstract form about those sciences that most people are not interested in but then around one thousand years after the computer began to usurp the human thinking and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological physical and chemical ones suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring over night r w fassbinder's welt am together with tarkovsky's solaris and godard's alphaville is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases fassbinder was a master to sell highly contents to his public by theoretical knowledge into practical appetizing forms the basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality but on the other side a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry however logically spoken the only reason why we have just one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values right and false now take a logic with just one more value i e with three then as you can easily see you have already three identities what happens now when let us say dr stiller gets killed then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death another question is if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once the idea however to display such sets of identities in a up down or down up way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel is misleading since identities and hence realities are not structured in hierarchical but in a way strictly speaking there is no artificial identity either since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another therefore the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two valued logic either a second identity would imply that a person at the same time exists and not exists but now look around and see that one and the same object which is by definition self identical is perceived by every subject in its own way if therefore every subject sees an object differently why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two valued individuality corset with the effect that different persons can exchange their different fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece despair a trip into the light
<START> asia argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn't a bad thing in it's self but when her character talks about all the guys she serviced and to see her with michael madsen and an asian guy in the present tense of the movie it made me feel like i needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie like a disease was going to rub off on me or something br br the movie felt like it was going for a love triangle drama action plot it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time the acting was great the plot not so great the director needs to at least pick a genre and practice practice practice before trying to do something as complicated as this again because they are not very good at it obviously
<START> this is a great tv miniseries of a classic novel janet mcteer and john bowe in the lead roles are exceptional this is one of the best adaptations from a book that i have seen i would love to get a copy of this let me know if you know how i might get one thanks
<START> let me begin by saying that i had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile after finally getting the chance to see it last night i'm sorry to say that i was incredibly disappointed it's hard to imagine a film that could make last exorcist the beginning look good but dominion does just that no wait it makes it look like a great film br br perhaps i got myself too excited about this movie and that contributed to the let down after all the idea that warner bros was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction plus i'm a huge fan of stellan and in true fashion he gives a great performance despite the often ridiculous content of the film on the other hand the supporting cast in this film is abysmal clara seems to be capable of only one expression blank stare and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone while gabrielle mann's father frances is just ridiculous the effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously this movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either i could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers but frankly i'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things i'd love to say br br the saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past had huge potential especially with as leading man unfortunately for us that potential was wasted go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the harlin version but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life otherwise be content with the version first released and move on
<START> it is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of acting adult is not engaging in sensuality instead these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema the production values are good especially sweeping shots of montana and florida the soundtrack by jimmy buffet is a perfect fit the young actors are spirited and refreshing br br the plot about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing owls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder will engage kids so many films make children appear powerless it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference and even though parents are absent or temporarily distracted it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices br br if you are tired of all of the self indulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema give hoot a shot then take some time to talk to your kids about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world they live in a positive message from a positive film
<START> i caught this on cinemax very late at night nothing else was on so i pretty much had no choice bottom line terrible plot slow waste of good film and actors' time to make it short don't even bother with this one it's too bad we can't give as a rating this one really is not worth even a consideration
<START> to anyone who likes the tv series forget the movie the jokes are bad and some topics are much too sensitive to laugh about it br br we have seen much better acting by r in 8
