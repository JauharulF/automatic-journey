<START> this is a stupid movie like a lot of these karate movies it is badly written awkward and sometimes just stupid the action really isn't all there and the movie overall leaves much to be desired everyone here is talking jive doing bad karate and doing a very bad job of acting br br watch for scatman crothers in a small role he is too good for this movie overall jim kelly is good at karate but he is a terrible actor gloria hendry is real bad all of them are there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense the supposed love running away scene with hendry and kelly what the hell was that they destroyed that man's guitar for no reason br br and then there was the mandatory girls on now what was that they were in the movie for five seconds then you never heard from them again then there is the whole racially charged element of the movie which is cool and all but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere like i said this is good for a laugh one time but don't watch it again
<START> i can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clichÃ©s br br where the two unarmed leads have to get down the college steps into the van he surrounds them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten he can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads shove their way down the steps br br sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombies br br with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better
<START> i absolutely hated this movie even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message it was done in such a clichÃ© ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera br br also the acting was terrible especially and her son that's one of the problems with dominican movies they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses br br i'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality
<START> writer director brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies and he seems to think that he's discovered the formula for success plenty of location shots in new york preferably in the winter allusions to old hollywood films especially musicals enjoyable musical soundtrack alas all of this is mere compensation for burns' lack of talent as a writer the great mystery of many writer directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios but how they get any backing at all for their films br br normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters but the couple in this film simply has no appeal this is not the fault of either david or milla their characters are just poorly written what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters' personalities lacking the ability to create individuals burns gives us an after school special inspired by men are from mars women are from venus br br how anyone can see burns as the successor to woody allen is beyond me i did not laugh once during this film and the screen play is full of echo chamber dialog i want to paint the town red you want to paint the town red which is the most tell tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living in one of the early scenes we see actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom it's the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right maybe that indicates what burns talents are really suited for
<START> great another foreign film that thinks it's fellini on top of that we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people br br i see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercials br br i found nothing redeeming about this film what can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on in spite of some adversity it does not take courage to commit suicide that is the action of a coward sharing this wish with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has if this had been a film about a man's courage to go on in spite of his problems similar to the jill kinmont story that would have made it a great film br br if you're interested in seeing true courage check out the movies about jill kinmont the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident
<START> my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator the extra on the film and his unhappy assessment of the film i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director the film was sweet the acting sufficient the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week it wasn't the hours acting or the matrix special effects or even the color purple direction most movies won't be but it also wasn't the crap fest that vinny would lead you to believe sorry guy just my 2 cents br br as to the movie itself it was in the end very gay affirming 1 it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people you know just like ours 2 it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures 3 and i liked the music 4
<START> this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated i can't even count how many times i've seen dirty dancing this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love br br there is something timeless about this movie i have loved other blockbuster love story movies like pretty woman and when harry met sally i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect the characters the chemistry between and grey the movie's direction the incredible dancing the warm summery atmosphere everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect it is an instant classic and i've never really seen a movie like it either before or since br br i don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers dirty dancing has a nostalgic languid summery mood realistic characters a honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us br br this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it but i will mention i have no interest in seeing nights this one they should have left alone
<START> when i put this movie in my dvd player and sat down with a coke and some chips i had some expectations i was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong points of the first movie awsome animation good flowing story excellent voice cast funny comedy and a kick ass soundtrack but to my disappointment not any of this is to be found in atlantis milo's return had i read some reviews first i might not have been so let down the following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned br br when the first scene appears your in for a shock if you just picked atlantis milo's return from the display case at your local or whatever and had the expectations i had the music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one with the exception of a few characters like the voice of sweet the actual drawings isnt that bad but the animation in particular is a sad sight the storyline is also pretty weak as its more like three episodes of doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time but dont misunderstand it's not very good doo episodes i didnt laugh a single time although i might have once or twice br br to the audience who haven't seen the first movie or don't especially care for a similar sequel here is a fast review of this movie as a stand alone product if you liked doo you might like this movie if you didn't you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do and i suspect it might be a good kids movie but i wouldn't know it might have been better if milo's return had been a three episode series on a cartoon channel or on breakfast tv
<START> sometimes intentionally campy at other times unintentionally silly like in the opening scene where a woman is informed that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered just for the sake of exposition this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough as a straightforward adventure story to be really enjoyable i'll leave you to decide which may be the highlight but the low point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon brigitte nielsen was a good choice for sonja with her fresh face and her firm slightly muscular body and i think that her dark red hair suits her perfectly but schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances as 1 2
<START> containing billy's famous humor this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure pleasantly unexpectedly so for billy crystal this movie has different tear jerker dramatic serious underlying themes particularly with a scene with steven seagal this movie was both entertaining and serious a movie about lost love about relationships with father son husband wife about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in especially at the beginning the balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid the discovery of billy crystal's talent scout agent character in romania of a giant human is revealing and the behind the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self eight out of ten stars
<START> demi and woody are married but they're poor they meet robert redford and he's really rich he takes a fancy to demi and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an indecent proposal one million dollars for a night with the little woman br br at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep of course demi is going to accept the offer if she doesn't there's no first half of the movie of course it will affect demi and woody's marriage if it doesn't there's no second half of the movie and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll if it doesn't there's no happy ending for the sake of box office br br the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress as for the rest the script is incompetent the direction amateurish the performances negligible i suspect redford moore and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned do them and more importantly yourself a favor unless some one offers you a million miss it br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> the director of this movie is a famous french tv presenter patrick sebastien he likes music and humor for rednecks and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image it's the story of a young retarded person called sic a night he sees his sister's sm sexual relation and decide to do the same thing he rape the girl who he loves is placed in a asylum and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic one man will find them one man will reunite them this man is a psychologist this man looks like a hell's angel this man is patrick sebastien with an excessive use of clichÃ©s we'll see how the absolute love can break all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist we'll also learn how using sandwiches in order to seduce a girl not only patrick sebastien thinks that he can do better than one century of psychiatry but he also impose us a silly left ideology with the character of the father's girlfriend a boss who want to take away the feeble of his girl distressing but it's very pleasant to laugh at mentally retarded persons are not funny except in this movie
<START> i'm glad i read the sarah waters novel first since i had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time the ones cast for this production however were not at all disappointing in fact after i got used to rachael stirling as nan i think nina gold did a damn fine job in the casting department can hawes be more delicious br br the bbc has done it again this is a wonderful production of a very good book and they have done it up in style if you can get your hands on this vhs dvd be sure to get the minute version the uncensored one it is a marvelous journey albeit a bit rocky at times that you won't regret taking
<START> i actually own this movie which is the mst3k version called cave dwellers which is really the only way anyone could really watch a movie like this if it weren't for joel crow and tom servo constantly making wisecracks it wouldn't be possible to sit through this piece of crap you have a hero called ator who looks a lot like jeff in fast times at ridgemont high and appears only slightly more intelligent just without being stoned he takes on cavemen the cave dwellers invisible guys a giant snake with a bunch of anal retentive snakes that like to line up all the skulls to face the same way invents a hang glider which suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines wrapped around it and then does battle with the evil john saxon looking dude then he rides off on his horse across the tire tracks where someone's been four wheeling br br yes i got most of that from mst3k which as i said is the only way to watch this turkey of a movie if it weren't for that it would get zero stars
<START> this film is a masterpiece it was exhilarating from beginning to end writer director paul thomas anderson's story about a porn star is told with style grace humor even poignancy the actors and the characters they play are all first rate including mark wahlberg in the lead who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers wahlberg the film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead on accuracy from the disco scene that begins the film to wahlberg's don johnson miami vice outfit that he wears in the final scene most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese the film is a triumph in style the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute beginners the editing by dylan is simply phenomenal i couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an oscar nomination good will hunting was a better edited film the best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers i had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense when i saw the film a second time i had the exact same reaction to the scene unfortunately it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good stereo sound it's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run because it is the best way to watch it anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on tv so get the dvd or a letterbox tape it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look because this is only his second film the music sets costumes photography offbeat characters sex violence happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking
