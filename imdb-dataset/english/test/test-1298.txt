<START> this is a funny clever film and well worth your time in my opinion it is much better than american pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time i hadn't heard of this film so i guess it didn't get much press which is kind of a shame it doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important as opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his d k in a pie but in the end everyone gets laid and whoop de do one thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american pop punk they actually had real punk from back in the day like the ramones that in itself made the film better to be honest i wasn't expecting much from this film and i was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is
<START> well i guess i know the answer to that question for the money we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie i admit i thought the trailers looked bad but i still had to give it a chance well i should have went with my instincts it was a complete piece hollywood trash once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good must be good aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long it obviously started with a moth eaten script it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor and awful pastel sceneries it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction this is then compounded with yes i'll say it bad acting i couldn't help but feel like i was watching coffee talk on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either but mr myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie f no stars 0 on a scale of 1 10 save your money
<START> over acted heavy handed full of speeches preachy on the nose and over stylized in a way only mtv could be guilty of stop loss is prop garbage i expected a lot more with talented young actors such as joseph gordon levitt and ryan philippe but screenwriter director kimberly does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on american youth i'm sure she did some work researching the iraq war and the young men fighting in it but you'd never guess it from watching stop loss in many ways this mess reminded me of catherine hardwicke's lords of dogtown an equally inept overly stylized tv movie like waste of solid subject matter br br http eattheblinds blogspot com
<START> just to save you the 3 or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store and the anguishing hour and however long this movie is here's a simple plan go over to a friend's house talk them into renting the pest for you watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up some excuse to leave the opening sequence is really funny definitely worth watching unfortunately the other 99 of the movie is horrible without the shower scene at the beginning this is one of the worst movies of all time
<START> this is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies i've seen for awhile i had to wonder if john ryhs davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie th looked like a cross between the from land of the lost and the creature from the black lagoon additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the of legend is much smaller all in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the but the captain's kick boxing daughter do ok watch if you are sick at home or feeling down and need a good laugh
<START> definitely the best game for n64 ever i most say i was disappointed with tomorrow never dies but the world is not enough promises to be better then goldeneye according to the website i love goldeneye so much i find something to do every time i play it i have even made up my own missions for the levels multi player is the best of any game out there and the graphics are astounding even now the first day i got this i remember wishing that they would go back and make all of the bond movies into games can you imagine driving that speed boat in live and let die and making those incredible jumps or fighting off ninjas or fighting jaws in the spy who loved me and moonraker i think fighting him in those games would be more fun then in the aztec what about chasing sanchez in the gas trucks or st in for your eyes only oh well let me get back to the game at hand all of the levels are unique and make for very fun killing environments there are many places to hide so you can sneek up on people especially statue park well this game is not worthy of renting you really need to buy it today
<START> i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress julianne nicholson i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted all the actors and actresses played well especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future andy richter who played carl i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions and the several consulting meetings is like the real world jay mohr who played ed the future husband also played very real behavior but i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which julianne nicholson is capable of and does so naturally was overwhelming for me indeed the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored it raises again and again in my thoughts
<START> despite the previous reviewer's screed this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci fi films that influenced spielberg lucas and others in their more recent efforts i agree that spielberg's films aren't even in the same league as the films discussed here such as william cameron menzies' brilliant invaders from mars to name just one of the many titles examined but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid sci fi yes it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of war of the worlds during the last fifteen minutes you can turn that off the rest is surprisingly good and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them even if they can't begin to match the originals
<START> before seeing this film the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story i didn't enjoy that film very much but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashion br br the actors don't shine the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases the only character of real interest for me was anthony intelligent jaggers br br the so called plot is ridiculous but the story itself is a great one it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you live with an open mind and don't care what other people say you are what you are if others can't take it 'em pip was told this early on but he didn't listen br br the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story not in that same horrible level but in the way she molded the child to create the of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her childhood didn't appear much better the ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story's style the sets looked cheap and coming to imdb i'm not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv movie which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library br br live and learn so many good movies so little time that's why the reviews are here so you wouldn't have to waste your time on this sort of movies br br 3 10
<START> this thriller is one of the few film surprises i've had in quite some time everybody and i do mean everybody i talked to when it was in the theatres said it was awful but then i got to thinking none of these people really understand horror thriller films or metal rock so why do i listen to them in the first place this film kicks ass but only if you are able to comprehend and enjoy this type of entertainment in short too late see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind the soundtracks great too
<START> don't pick this one spoiler alert the plot of this aggravatingly bad movie is four friends are talked into taking the shuttle from the airport by a very zealous driver on the shuttle with them is a rather milquetoast looking business type br br shortly into their trip the driver of the shuttle takes an off ramp and some lunatic driver tries to run them off the road the end result is they get a flat tire the driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire and the jack slips and the guys fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle it's at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a kidnapper and he has taken all the people hostage br br now the movie gets extremely slow and tedious as the characters do one lame thing after another one of the men is killed trying to escape even that lacks any suspense finally it is revealed that the milquetoast business guy is in cahoots with the driver when milquetoast guy kills the other male friend by slitting his throat br br there are a couple of attempts to escape by the women milquetoast is beaten over the head with a tire iron yet he survives br br the driver is also beaten and somehow survived a head on collision with a fence at high speed while kneeling next to the steering wheel somehow he didn't go through the window or even get seriously injured with a collision with windshield yet the woman driving the shuttle is knocked unconscious yet she had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield br br he is eventually able to subdue the women and get them to an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking one of the women is killed the other one stabs the driver in the leg with a good sized piece of broken mirror and shoots him in the head yet he is able in what should be a severely weakened state severe blood loss two head injuries and a large leg gash to drag her out of the shuttle drag her to a large crate throw her in and get it locked all the while with her fiercely fighting him br br now some people admire the message of the movie about human trafficking and how it is going on today this is a serious problem but making an extremely boring movie about the topic does not entitle it to a higher rating
<START> kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called k pax his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand and find out if he is really from k pax br br this movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre one big part of k pax is drama science fiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what k pax is all about the story as you see above isn't too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics accompany this movie and there's no need to have them the music in the film is great however a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes k pax sound sci fi and makes certain scenes intriguing br br kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien from the planet k pax emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all they've both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary mccormack mccormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient woodard plays dr powell's coworker claudia we don't really see claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performance br br k pax is rated pg 13 for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it as far as violent images go we don't see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but that's all language is as follows 1 f word wow only one 11 s words and a few uses of the lord's name in vain not too bad really the sensuality part is just from when explains to dr powell how reproduction works on k pax nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg 13 movie it could have been a lot worse br br in conclusion k pax is not a bad movie it won't stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean it's a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to k pax is a well done movie br br bonus if you've seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes 8 10
<START> once a month i invite a few friends over for a retarded movie night we look forward to movies that are either so bad they're funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a lot of chests last night we were unfortunate enough to have zombie planet as one of our movies the cinematography is on par with what we're used to but the acting was a different story the lead role is played by a johnny depp rob zombie wanna be who couldn't get a role in a high school play let alone a low budget horror film our indecisive hero who couldn't tell whether or not he wanted to be a bad ass this scene or a whimpering coward was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that i have ever had to stop early during a retarded movie night it had the possibility for greatness with a great twist on the standard zombie infection but they took it an entirely different direction based on johnny zombie i personally would not recommend this to any of my friends however it's unfortunate that i already invited a few over last night to suffer through 80 of this movie with me
<START> first i must say that i enjoyed the first underworld movie i was intrigued and curious to learn about vampires and and so forth in this last part hopefully of the series i just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are at least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem they look and act like haughty white pasty humans br br some ideas were neat the whole thing with human nobles was interesting pity the acting was abysmal the slave thingy too was feasible br br other things just hit me as pathetic spoilers now castle walls that can be jumped over in a few steps enemies that don't attack during the day big bad ancient vampires that take ages to join combat and then run away from a fledgling leader after a minute or so werewolves that den close to their enemies that raid for what they don't use axes and swords or armor a vampire leader so inept he manages to have just about everyone against him the romance is so unconvincing its sad br br so i don't recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket some of the action is good to ok certainly the vampires armor and weapons are interesting otherwise a very weak script that was badly put together and uses all sorts of inane plot twists
<START> burt reynolds directed this action movie and surprise he is actually a pretty good director this movie starts off well as burt's attempted bust of a drug dealer is botched and he is down to the vice squad the ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes as brian kieth is always eating something bernie casey has more class than all of his co workers combined and charles durning loses control of his squad br br the vice cops stumble on a high priced call girl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders spends days staking out rachel ward apartment and starts to really adore her from afar br br just when they are getting close to the crime leader is murdered i won't give away any of the surprises in the plot but the first hour of this film is great br br unfortunately the screenplay gets very clichÃ©d and unbelievable after that br br why would burt reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret sure it makes the guy sweat but it causes many more cops to be killed and it is not believable that and would make love after they have know each other for one day much less while their lives are in danger and at the end what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes isn't there a swat team also the film never actually tells you how all of the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people br br there is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film which is probably the only really nail biting scene of the film it is a shame that the climax is a typical shoot em up still this film is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies don't think about the plot holes and you will have a good time
