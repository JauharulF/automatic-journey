<START> this review is for the uk dvd three disc box set disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior chasing jamie and fast and curious disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special falling in lust again and love potion no 10 the final disc is called anything goes and contains she's the boss and legally yours why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material br br each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe lauren hayes reading a letter from a satisfied customer we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines for instance model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel she's the boss is about a put upon male secretary dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised much to her pleasure all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex br br it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action finally the end credits mention the palm hotel singer island florida although my map of florida shows no singer island the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release 4 stars
<START> why was this movie ever made they have tarnished the original caddyshack with this crap i was only able to watch half of it and i didn't laugh once at least i didn't pay to see it because it was on t v but i won't get back that hour of my life that i spent watching this dreadful mess there wasn't one original star from the first except for chevy chase and he probably regrets doing this film jackie mason was supposed to be the outrageous funny buffoon like rodney dangerfield was in the first but jackie mason wasn't funny at all jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield if you want laugh watch the first caddyshack if you like terrible movie's then this you're movie this movie stinks like a barnyard in july avoid at all cost
<START> radio will have you laughing crying feeling this story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view there's enough for both cuba gooding jr portrays the title character to perfection his performance is worthy of an academy award nomination the compassion of the movie is obvious the movie evokes many emotions i sincerely enjoyed this film
<START> one of the worst arnold movies i've seen special effects were terrible script was horrible hopefully his next movie will be much better like t2 total recall true lies and eraser not as good as the rest watch stigmata if you want to see an apocalyptic future movie it's much better
<START> i recently viewed a copy of this under the title 'eaten alive' talk about dreadful any movie ed wood ever put out looks like oscar material compared to this laughable tosh to be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as these people cannibals don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me classic the mad type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film he really did look like a nutter i think he was the only actor not to be dubbed in badly if these italians must have american characters in their films why dont they get americans to dub in the dialogue instead of english people trying their best to sound like annie oakley i'll give this 3 out of 10 i'll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedies out these days
<START> this one hardly compares to the space adventures of its time those being star wars and star trek and while i am no fan of star trek i recognize that this film pales in comparison to the series trekkies ooze over in fact i would place back to the future in better light in terms of space and travel br br the story is of a boy who is captured by space raiders pirates in a obviously fake and unentertaining battle the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them and slowly one by one those raiders die off in the end the boy gets to return home and the last remaining pirates escapes gravely wounded br br the acting wasn't that great but what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue effects and storyline how they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me br br if you want to take a shot at it because it involves space go ahead but be warned d
<START> i just finished screening el padrino in germany a great film we look forward to seeing more films from mr in the future it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic the ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel seeing a film with great quality truly outlines serious potential and his adept skill as a writer actor director and filmmaker has impressed many with his triumphant performance in blood in and blood out and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control something that few film makers can afford
<START> bedrooms and hallways gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy if you think that all gay comedies are the same check this one out although the movie ends without much resolution the hilarious one liners peculiar situations and quirky characters are sure to satisfy
<START> remake of the classic 1951 the thing from another world 12 men are in a completely isolated station in they are invaded by a thing from outer space it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to it starts off as a dog but gets loose and has a chance to duplicate any of the men soon nobody trusts anyone else they're isolated the radio is destroyed their helicopter likewise what are they going to do br br the 1951 film had the thing just be a big super human monster that movie was scary this one is too but the story is different and based more closely on the source material the novelette who goes there and it's scary in a different way the movie starts right off with ennio morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and when the thing gets attacked the amount of gore is astounding there's blood and body parts flying all over arms are bitten off heads detach and in the strongest one one man is devoured face first by the thing the gore effects are strong and real nightmare material i don't scare easy but i had to sleep with the lights on when i saw this originally back in 1982 rob effects are just incredible how this picture got by with an r rating is beyond me br br it also has a very creepy feel gore aside it is very suspenseful you're not sure who is what and carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension one complaint no one is given any distinctive personality traits they actors just remain straight faced and say their lines that's annoying but the movie still works br br this was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 it competed with e t and many critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie it's now considered one of john carpenter's best a must see for strong stomaches not a date film br br an amusing note when this was released universal sent a note along with all prints of the film they suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms they were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up
<START> i'm from ireland and i thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any brad pitt or other american doing the accent furthermore i have rarely seen any british actor handle an american or canadian accent except for colin farrel in minority report this film is a little film and it was entertaining no it wasn't a blockbuster hollywood production but frankly i'm sick of that shite i laughed more than a few times and had a good time it was definitely worth the rental the main character is a spoof on other hard british gangsters at least that's the way i saw it if you go in expecting a 100 million dollar production you'll be disappointed enjoy it for what it is a small entertaining film
<START> i'm not saying anything new when i say that ray was magnificent as i proceed to laud this movie i have to mention something that sets it apart from other films very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor s ray quite simply was made by jamie foxx without the wonderful performance of jamie foxx ray would just be another interesting and informative biopic i always thought foxx was funny stemming from his days with in livin' color and the jamie foxx show and i also knew that he was talented as he used his own show the jamie foxx show to show off his musical talents but never did i imagine that he could pull off a role like this i don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that but what i saw from jamie foxx was extremely impressive he wrapped himself into that role and made us see ray charles rather than an actor portraying ray charles the story of ray was great yes but it was given life by jamie foxx
<START> i have seen this movie just once and i'm looking forward to see it again and again dear david from why did you bother to write a comment on this movie i only think we can think about you after reading you comment is that you're a non sexual person like erika in the movie and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up i guess you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your visage the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival and i'm is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with best actress best actor and grand prix isabelle huppert is magnificent as always who would do this movie like her one of her best performances ever the music is fantastic and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen it's like a kind of movie because of the topic try to see it br br
<START> in the dusty little town of furlough in texas an animal is slaughtering the cattle and the locals when the teenager tommy michael is killed their friends anna furlough erika fay her mexican american boyfriend miguel gonzalez gabriel jill sara and rosie martine hughes finds that a mexican werewolf is the killer and they plot a plan to kill the beast br br mexican werewolf in texas is an amateurish crap and among the worse movies i have ever seen if not the worst nothing works in this movie the screenplay is laughable with some of the most terrible lines i have ever heard the direction does not exist and the camera follows the style of the blair witch project the amateurish acting seems to be a prank of high school students or a high school play the special effects are gruesome and extremely poor and the werewolf is the cheapest i have ever seen ed wood movies are cult but this mexican werewolf in texas is pure garbage in the end jill says that no man can resist her actually the most beautiful thing in this flick but i believe the correct quote should be no man or woman can resist to watch this movie to the end i was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be and i lost 88 minutes of my life but i believe most of the viewers will stop seeing with less than 20 minutes running time my vote is one awful br br title brazil um no texas a mexican werewolf in texas
<START> warning herzog is a filmaker and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic so obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life but a dramatic embellishment or so both agreed at the premiere in san francisco but herzog's usual fascination with character dreams and perseverance are well suited by this story first published in soldier of fortune and now a full length autobiographical book the soldier of fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct sf audience and both filmaker and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film that interest was misplaced so warning this is not rambo just survival
<START> despite myself i really kinda like this movie pauley shore is invariably laugh out loud funny and here is no exception he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold br br his performance in this although nothing out of the ordinary for him is so good it seems to lift other cast members' performances perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce off of br br the clichÃ©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way shore's city boy crawl is so at odds with the way of life is funny too but it's not only he who's a fish out of water comedy also comes from the fact that to any ordinary person or people crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person that's why this movie works in such a great way we love crawl he's a breath of fresh air but we can also sympathise with the warners he is one hell of a culture shock br br although this movie is classic pauley shore so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie enjoy it you do and there's even a never judge a book by it's cover type moral here somewhere not bad not bad at all
