<START> if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci fi film around a sexy statuesque female android surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time well sadly this movie is pretty close to useless there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said however there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise firstly this is a comedy with no funny bits at all or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way secondly the title character is woefully underused this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film i don't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest anyway what we are left with is a whole lot of mind numbing comedy relief which often is made up of hopeless spoof type gags of the big sci fi hits of the time such as alien star wars and 2001 it's badly written and not funny at all and it doesn't even really have a plot to propel things along the story basically is about a police space cruiser that is sent to get a rock that's it steven spielberg once said that a high concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence what he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence pointless maybe br br this seemed like a sure fire winner to me but it failed miserably it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been a barbarella for the 80's this ain't br br shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest i just think it's a great shame that dorothy didn't have a better film left to her
<START> this movie was great and i was waiting for it for a long time when it finally came out i was really happy and looked forward to a 10 out of 10 it was great and lived up to my potential the performances were great on the part of the adults and most of the kids the only bad performance was by milo himself there was one problem that i encountered with this and others like it movie all of the characters i wanted to live were getting killed overall i give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10 maybe we should select better people to kill next time though ok
<START> this movie follows in the tracks of the riddle for an all star british cast in a downright awful movie poor cgi effects poor editing poor direction a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin br br nigel should've donned his neil wig once more gone out with a laugh at least br br it was like a particularly long drawn out episode of torchwood but without the camp fake canadian doctor fella it had the same overly dramatic music though perpetually repeated in a vain attempt to drum up some tension br br oh the humanity
<START> i watched this movie last night i'm a huge fan of the book and i was pretty happy with the version in which winona ryder and susan sarandon starred but this one it's just awful oh my god i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister and making amy the 3rd one and jo interpretation terrible jo was a feminist intelligent and kinda angry young lady and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl and what's with the laurie going to war i'm ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made but not re write the whole story very very bad done
<START> one of the latest disaster movies from york entertainment el excels in making its viewer want to die after having wasted two hours watching it this movie appears to have been filmed with a spare camcorder normally used for birthday parties the only reason i could tell that it wasn't was because of certain scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame br br just about every aspect of cinema is plagued by this movie and i'm sure that it has set the film industry back another ten years the actors are borderline retarded often pausing while they wait for the off screen cue card to change the actor that plays not only slurs and skips word in his dialogue but stumbles through the swiss cheese plot line with a squinting and confounded look on his face other actors break the forth wall and overall show the acting skill of a twelve year old kid doing a science project in his backyard br br my friends and i purposefully search out the worst possible movies and this one gave us more than we bargained for the humorous parts are unfunny and the rest is riddled with horrible clichÃ©s and plot holes as one friend so humbly put it this movie is the aborted fetus of the industry i would highly suggest this film for people like me that purposely search for these movies but for all others beware
<START> i just saw the dvd and loved it in particular i thought the director and jude and nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between and ada just before left it was the most romantic kiss i've ever seen in a film i thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie it managed to make it believable that and ada would walk wait respectively for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship i thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself i'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one but this one is it for me jude and nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together
<START> this film is absolutely appalling and awful it's not low budget it's a no budget film that makes ed wood's movies look like art the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty no talent was used to make this film and the female love interest has a huge italian taste maybe even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really discerning this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny just boring and extremely cheap it's actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this
<START> having broken into a secret database file for matching dna federal agent frank poo andy garcia discovers the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath played by michael keaton however when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong a certain mr poo has to do everything in his power to ensure the madman stays alive in order to make the inevitable transfer possible by the way his name really poo i just feel like calling it him despite the original concept at hand this is an implausible and turgidly unexciting action thriller i've never been a big fan of andy garcia and granted his charecter here that this movie winds up all the worse the action sequences are handled pretty disappointingly and the ending sucks pretty bad having done a great villain in pacific heights keaton's psychopathic bad guy here is a let down providing a madman too funny and charismatic to be brian cox is also wasted as garcia's firm and frank superior
<START> finally watched this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing mindf it is and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total assault on the senses looks like a movie from the minds of lynch specifically eraserhead buttgereit and even a little of begotten what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief but then again did it really happen or is it his brain's left and right sides doing battle that's the main theme of this piece of art to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side and the music in this movie is unbelievable a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes including hard core sex you will ever see in any movie i viewed it as a work of art and loved it and that music still amazes me i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available watching subconscious cruelty is a real event and not something the viewer will easily forget and a note to gorehounds this is a must have br br warning be careful buying this movie because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore especially the copies from the japanese release
<START> ok i haven't read the and maybe the book was who knows but i loved the movie it was entertaining not a bit boring enjoyable and most of all heart wrenching the friendship between the two kids was so pure and innocent these kids acted so well especially the son of the servant oh my god that's like the form of god on the face of earth he steals our heart so easily spoilers the other friend the rich guy is a kid and his confusion and frustration can be understood but i did get angry when he abandoned and ignored his friend in the time when he needed consoling anyways he was just a kid and a bit stubborn to i wish the movie would also have shown the older version of the poor kid it pains to just think of the ending this movie is sad i felt terribly sad during the ending tears dropped down my eyes yes the background scores are fantastic the scenes are wow the kite scenes are fascinating and well it gets a bit of an adventure in the middle wonderfully acted and superbly cast the kids acted so well great direction don't know why this movie failed to the critics but it sure did woo me 10 10 must
<START> this movie could have been oh so much better it is a beautiful story set in very trying times and yet it was so poorly executed the leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film although at times their dialogue seems stilted and forced the directing could have been more concise the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers who took a good story and made it tedious in short there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours
<START> america's next top model is a good show it helps people with their careers but lately i have become bored with it br br cycle 1 yeah i'm happy adrienne won i wanted her to win from the beginning br br cycle 2 its too bad i think mercedes deserved it br br cycle 3 i did not like eva but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle br br cycle 4 should have won i don't know what they saw in but i definitely know what they saw in br br cycle 5 like cycle 3 this was not a great cycle either but out of all the girls nicole as a winner eww br br cycle 6 i liked sara and joanie but danielle is okay too br br cycle 7 definitely deserved it br br cycle 8 no i didn't want to win i didn't like her i saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her although i did not see much of this cycle br br good show i've just seen it too many times to like it much anymore d
<START> when it opened in london during the christmas season of 1969 this musical version of james hilton's famous story was by the critics the same reception greeted it when it opened in the us prompting mgm to withdraw its roadshow status and cut almost all of its songs what a mistake br br watched years later when the trendy world of the 60's and 70's has turned in upon itself this version of goodbye mr chips is a total delight first of all as chipping peter o'toole gives one of his greatest performances to watch him turn from the hated cold emotionless latin teacher at a boy's boarding school to a man who finally can see the colors in the world after falling for and marrying musical star catherine is to see a genius at work if you can watch lawrence of arabia the lion in winter my favorite year and chips back to back over a number of days or weeks then you will see what a truly great actor o'toole is and how magnificent he is in chips br br catherine as played by the glowing clark at the height of her popularity is ever man's dream beautiful loving understanding with a great voice to boot most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly while the direction by the late herbert ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life br br okay this film may be a bit too romantic for some people but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted sung and directed love story look no further if you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version better yet i am anxiously awaiting chips' debut on dvd
<START> new year's day the day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight my wife and i discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of january we had a choice do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of x files on dvd that we received from our daughter for christmas br br we elected for the digital freebie since the dvds are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve hour days to watch all the x files beginning to end the drive in channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon asylum 1972 house of the damned 1996 and the pit and the pendulum 1961 asylum is well reviewed here and the pit and the pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for house of the damned br br to be honest we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials greg evigan william shatner's over written and alexandra paul the only baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten year old boy unfortunately we soon dissolved to giggles under the influence of a little hair of the dog as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes poltergeist the shining hell house house on haunted hill ghost busters br br the acting especially by real life daughter wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with the cgi for 1996 was hilarious at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and i dissolved in laughter br br overall acting 4 5 script 2 5 sfx 0 5
<START> this is one of the funniest movies ever made and for those of you who don't get it it's supposed to be funny so often comedies try to be so intentionally funny that it misses but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being hilarious in the most subtle of ways even spoofs lack the originality and natural feel of this film it is a comedic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios are this sort of thing regularly kudos to the makers and to a hilariously subtle cast of actors including isaac wade whose performances is top notch truly a real break out star performance by an true underrated stage actor it'll be great to see this guy get his due
