<START> this movie almost has everything the action is cool it's funny 2 great leading men and a truly nasty villain that i really hated not a lot of films have bad bad guys just mainly comic book villains he really does deserve a might ass kicking br br jake scott really does have his fathers talent for knowing how to make great visuals the direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel i don't usually like films set in the old days but this i liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are sense and sensibility age of innocence and the absolute worst lady and the duke this will restore your faith thanx mostly to craig armstrong's amazing score the music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in scenes of action it is very exciting br br the dvd is in dolby 5 1 and has a very grainy and muddy looking 2 35 1 anamorphic picture
<START> into a happy household comes the gypsy girl played by myrna loy with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high pitched and weird it's hard to believe this is loy she bears no similarity whatsoever to the refined and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies instead she overacts so badly that you'd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability on top of the horrendously silly character the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting just very very stagy and stupid the only thing good about it is the vitaphone sound system making the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from 1929 heck it was even better than most 1930 films so the sound technician at least has something to be proud of all others forget it br br this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a guilty pleasure because the movie is so bad and after having seen it i disagree slightly the movie is simply bad
<START> gerald mcraney dave morgan war crimes '01 tv series was like a father to tiffani thiessen jennifer gallagher a kiss before lying '03 who experience a very bad situation in her life and it caused jennifer to be withdrawn with people and young men dave morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce jennifer to chris gallagher who falls madly in love with her at their very first meeting in almost one or two dates later chris asks jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees it is not very long after the wedding that things start to happen chris is in the navy and does not like working in submarines and things start happening to young gals in the neighborhood this is a very excellent tv film and it sometimes makes you wonder if the guy or gal i want as a soul mate is the perfect person
<START> there must have been some interesting conversations on the set of eagle's wing with martin sheen straight off apocalypse now co starred with the actor he replaced on coppola's film harvey keitel a real unloved child of a movie dating back to the last major batch of westerns in 1979 80 it was much reviled at the time for being made by a british studio and director conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic american westerns were directed by european Ã©migrÃ©s which seems a bit of an over reaction br br the plot is simplicity itself as martin sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with sam kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse the eagle's wing across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time before the legends began aside from caroline captive irish governess the supporting cast have little to do stephane never even gets to open her mouth and it is a little slow but anthony harvey's film does boast terrific scope photography from billy williams and a good score from marc wilkinson
<START> this is a quiet movie it's a simple story about a writer who cannot write his story coming back to his home town to get started but instead he gets involved in a friendship with a weird older man whose life externally represents perhaps the internal state of the writer it's a museum of unfinished ideas outdated equipment and useless people br br there are no extraordinary circumstances or any big movements in the plot it's a movie about internal changes being stuck in their lives which are not developing much the principal personages get to help each other to transform stop leaving in dreams and achieve something or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and long awaited new direction br br on the film making side i can think of only one weakness which could also be considered as a feature we do not get much of characters description or inner world insights it's very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about their true feelings which are rather hidden but still you can see them and this is what makes your own mind work trying to figure them out to understand the impressions made by those people and it's not empty underneath the actors definitely hold well some inner states proper to their characters it's close to the real life where you mostly never know someone well enough to understand them completely and this turns us around and puts in front of our own feelings and choices br br what's most important for me is that this simple almost flat story leaves you pondering afterwards about your own life about your own dreams and achievements are there any or are we caught up in the routine and pleasures leaving at 100 or only dreaming about it could we do more and move somewhere we'd rather like to be than just leaving feed ourselves and others the tales like i'll do this one day not moving one finger to make this actually happen or i'm fine where i am because it's easier to go by the habits than to actually make a change at least that's the impression it left me with and it was very timely for me which adds to my appreciation of this far from famous movie i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies meant for the heart but those who need events and actions should stay away
<START> i saw this on sale new at my local store for 6 and said hey an action film with that guy from bloodsport and enter the dragon directed by the guy who did enter the dragon and it's cheap so i bought it oops this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen and i've seen some doozies br br you know how movies which are intentionally campy like evil dead ii and dead alive are awesome you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like lionheart an old van damme film or john carpenter's vampires are pretty cool this film manages to be neither of those i don't know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while i'm on the script note i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that he's the only actor in the film that you'll ever recognize unless you're a jackie chan fan in which case you'll recognize the bad guy and you'll want to call him giancarlo br br what's also sad is that this film is from '92 by that time t2 judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over but not quite after this you'll think 80s chuck norris films high school comedies and jason freddy sequels were works of sheer genius br br things to know br br 1 nobody in this film can act for beans the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean and cocky everything else is dreadful br br 2 the martial arts scenes are forgettable just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at britton lee getting kicked by britton lee getting punched by britton lee then falling down even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks and equally stinky br br 3 the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at k mart and indeed they fire with the sound of a when someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with of brownish red liquid on their clothes britton lee apparently gets shot in the side but you don't see it at all then later that day you see the wound i've had paper cuts that were worse than that br br 4 of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know they're lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lee's characters didn't need to have sex with anybody to be cool br br 5 the car chase is by far the worst i've ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh i don't know about 30 miles an hour don't try this at home kids these people are professionals hah br br 6 really bad writing here's a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a gunfight in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girl's car stalls and she can't start it she tells lee she's involved now and she's coming with him he points out to her that they can't leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huh br br 7 if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too co with each other apparently in the '80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance the bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside without moving their lips in one scene the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if you're a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line br br 8 lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesn't notice the second time even though it's the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never notice br br 9 lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girl's car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn parenting from this film br br can't think of more gripes right now you get the idea is so bad it ain't even funny it's sad
<START> i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in dear john but it was very slow moving and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels ironically i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action br br the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very hang dog series of expressions in response to loss
<START> rose and the good doctor find themselves in a space station that is on a planet that's quite impossibly hovering in orbit right below a black hole the crew of the station is just as perplexed at that as the two new inhabitants are suitably spooky in it's atmosphere and gets better as the doctor and rose find themselves stranded due to circumstances out of their control and speaking through the submissive alien race of the ood something quite dark is coming from below the crust of the planet not haven seen the second part of this two parter i can't vouch that the end is as strong yet but it does make for one hell of a beginning br br my grade a
<START> this film is a good start for novices that have never watched a 'silent film' and for those who believe that quality cinema started with their generations efforts they are doing a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons the 'silent film' is a art form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage it can stands on it's own merits br br the beloved rogue 1927 united artists is a fictionalized history of the relationship of french poet and 'king louis through prodding 'king louis' will defeat his nemesis of minimize the feudal system and establish the king as head of the state and the beginnings of modern france br br the cast is exceptional lead by john barrymore yes drew's grandfather for those who only remember him for the decaying actor in dinner at eight 1933 or the ham in the women 1940 this will be a revelation fit trim with the 'great still in evidence he commands the screen co starring in his first american film is conrad veidt with his spider' interpretation of this is a duel of acting titans each not giving the other a inch on a trivia note is character actor and dwarf angelo rossitto in his first film his last mad max beyond thunderdome 1985 there are other character actors who would continue in sound that are easily picked up on br br united artists spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by william cameron menzies costumes props and sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a douglas fairbanks productions there is a touch of reality here the copy on dvd that we watched from 'delta entertainment' came from a good master though not its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from nuisance black spots dirt and drop outs the only major damage at the end of the last reel from water also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major on their prints best check with them in our opinion this is a 'must have' particularly if you have no in your collection this is a good place to start
<START> man i never laugh so much this year and it's pretty hard to make me laugh while i expected some hostel style movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning this film inside film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us the viewers that mute witness is not a typically horror movie br br the main character the mute american make up artist billy hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina her performance is top notch her character can't speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate and oh boy she did a wonderful job her sister fay ripley is the girlfriend or the fiancÃ©e or the wife of the in film director evan richards they were both very funny most of the time i won't spoil more but the scenes following the bathtub moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy br br the plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment but don't worry such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy girl friend
<START> i read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous karate kid installments although my favorite is still karate kid ii i felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share unlike the previous versions the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path rather than a male teenager maggi finds this a little more challenging but rises to the occasion the plot twists are believable and predictable i found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees the camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time the zen monastery is both austere and charming the zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow i liked the zen bowling scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious zen archery scene earlier on the quality level of the movie is like a good tv series the music chosen for the background is very good especially with the little river band playing listen to your heart the lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn they feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over glorify the fighting part all in all i enjoyed it
<START> as i post this comment imdb currently rates alfred hitchcock's subpar saboteur a 7 3 10 personally i rated it less than half that honestly i can't tell how a movie this bad could've come from what is probably the most consistently good director i know of i've seen about 10 other hitch movies from the 30's 60's vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while saboteur is easily the worst it's hard to believe that 7 years earlier hitch used the very same formula in the 39 steps far more competently my recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague it's the only hitchcock movie that i turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest if you must watch it then rent or borrow don't make the mistake i did and buy the dvd on good faith earned through notorious rebecca vertigo rear window etc even a master screws up sometimes i guess br br edit maybe i was a bit harder on this film than i should've been it's certainly nowhere near ed wood or manos or anything like that but there's three reasons i feel i must rate it so low br br 1 the name hitchcock brings with it certain expectations of quality this film delivers on a few of them but they're way overshadowed by the darn near non sensical plotting br br 2 i want to compensate a bit for all the 8 ratings this film is getting hitchcock is like the john coltrane of directors true fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art but the high rating on imdb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is br br 3 i spent 18 on this maybe if it'd cost me 5 or even 10 i'd probably be a bit less bitter
<START> shame is rather unique as a war film or rather quite the anti war film in that it not only doesn't focus on the soldiers or politics involved there is politics but not how you'd think it'd be shown it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal decaying society they inhabit ingmar bergman in the midst of his prime and following two other heavily psychological films persona and hour of the wolf is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings that it brings out the worst in them and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living his two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends max von sydow and liv ullman as the oddly enough who are musicians living on a farm on an island not too dissimilar from when one thinks about it br br they see the tanks roll by and a couple of old friends already getting worn down but they try not to put it too much to heart there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk rather frankly but with heart all one shot as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked then comes the trouble including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war and the terror involved with a 'friend' in the military one of gunnar most subtle works with bergman needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of bergman's filmography however for some it may be one of his more accessible works his religious themes this time is kept very low key even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere when there is war action it's shot in unconventional quick ways via great amigo sven nykvist br br and the deconstruction of the relationship between jan and eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war ground where the lines are never too surely drawn in a way this film shot right at the height of the worst times in vietnam is even more relevant for today i couldn't help but see chilling uncompromising coincidences between iraq and elsewhere with some of jan and eva's scenes with the fighters or those 'in charge' the very last scene by the way is one of bergman's very best all around acting directing lighting it's not the kind of war picture or again anti war i find little of the john wayne spirit in this production that i would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into saving private ryan it has a little more in kinship with paths of glory looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war but in reality like any of bergman's genre films it stands alone however one that packs a wallop for the art house crowd
<START> many american pea brains who worship and support the political half truths of hucksters like michael moore would do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic can scare intimidate and lie to an public and get the people they fear or loathe killed and mutilated robespierre in this fine epic kills the opposition by remote control all in a fit of self righteous devotion to his principles we get the impression that robes felt it quite justifiable to snip off his heads even as he sent his minions out to trump up false and misleading charges against the state today the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive that robes they merely murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or sources witness dan attempts to assassinate w's character on the eve of the 2004 election or the constant drumbeat that the 2000 election was stolen although constitutional scholars continue to scoff at such irresponsible drivel
<START> this show is just another bad comedy which will probably be cancelled after two seasons it's not just that the jokes are sexist racist homophobic they're also not funny and clichÃ©d in the first episode the father said something along the lines of ' i wish women didn't go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men blah blah that really helps attitudes huh then he was making fun of his son saying he was weird what parent says their kid is weird so overall this show is boring unoriginal offencive clichÃ©d and most of all not funny yeah american dad's offencive but it does also make you laugh and is obviously taking the micky thats the difference
