<START> can this film be considered as a film imagine the situation somebody puts a handy cam over a tripod and in front of a sea promenade and film people walking or jogging along it then he places the camera in a beach buys some ducks in a pet shop open their cages and let them run in front of the camera later he just films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in an absolute darkness is it an experiment or just an insult to the audience intelligence what would it happen if any unknown director did a film like that would we mark his job with 10 i always disappoint directors who believe that can do everything they want once they became famous

<START> i have little to no interest in seeing another awful movie that totally lacks anything new creative or funny abusing the national lampoon tag how ever something caught my eye in the cast of this movie i see danielle name i'm a big fan of boy meets world but the movies shes in are awful more so as a fan i'm not rewarded by seeing her terrible movies with the treasure of bare breast so this is where my question comes in br br has anyone seen this movie and if so does danielle get naked in it would save me the 2 hours of my life i would never get back watching this terrible movie thanks a lot
<START> i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler happy madison production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour br br there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie i realize that many are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all the acting was horrible the cinematography was very poor the plot made no sense at all i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing overall i was very unimpressed with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it
<START> based on the manga comic of well known artist masamune shirow this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me br br the story is good but the animation is merely ok while it could should have been mindblowing the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat uninspired if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by shirow ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many respects it set new standards for japanese animation and spawned among other things a brilliant series called stand alone complex br br i consider this worth a rental unless you're a fan of shirow and want it all do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended
<START> i am an avid movie watcher and i enjoy a wide variety of films however i found no enjoyment in this movie it is probably the worst movie i have ever seen i do not feel that it had much of a storyline the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best and the ending only made me dislike the movie more it is definitely not in the same category as the cave which was in my opinion the best cave movie ever made even the descent was better than this movie br br it was a waste of the 3 79 rental fee and of my time to watch this do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one
<START> yeah there's a sleeper watching sleeper cell and it was me after reading comparisons to 24 like on the cover of the dvd i expected a fast paced action romp but nope this series just along in my groggy half awake state i would think he's gonna and poof it would happen guess that van is gonna roll off the and there she goes br br and so on br br and why would in extra deep cover pursue a babe could it be perhaps to provide a little t a hey that works for me hence four stars rather than three br br this show is no 24 i've watched 24 sleeper cell you're no 24
<START> what a great movie this is i found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl and it is set in a tropical island well br br gerard brings his special european flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl they are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways but you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves br br there are a few cult classics which all teens should see this movie should be added to the list in addition to dirty dancing ferris bueller's day off bill and ted's excellent adventure rocky horror picture show and animal house my father the hero should be required film study watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months
<START> if they had a zero out of 10 i would of entered it everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public i don't know how films like this get released video or pay channel i am disappointed in vincent gallo val kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes so i can't get that mad at him only the person who listed him to be the star in it it is like marlon brando in superman there is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain
<START> the only good part of this movie was the ending you know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home no no that may be a little harsh the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended as long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well as for debut not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth as for going to see the movie wait for the rental or tv do not make the same mistake i did and pay 8 50
<START> exceptionally bad i don't expect much from garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today but keaton really should have known this movie would suck and gotten out while he could not that i'm especially fond of him but hey he did batman br br in one scene keaton is transported to a hospital chained down and wearing a hannibal lecter kind of face mask when two attack dogs bark at him dogs can sense evil you know puke and keaton growls back at them making them back off and whine with their tails between their legs did the movie turn comedy right there garcia makes a fool out of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogue only a complete retard could find plausible and the kid is too annoying to feel sorry for br br if you are gonna make a movie with as poor a plot as this you need some charm humour some solid action take die hard for example which is great despite its rather crappy plot br br even though character was a joke i routed for him all the way i wanted to see garcia cry over his dead kid and keaton sipping martinis on some paradise island however this movie makes for a good laugh watch it with a witty friend and you can have some fun as this movie begs for wisecracks in almost every scene br br all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money greed made this movie and thank god it bit its own ass
<START> i went to see this movie not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast this one certainly won't win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr de niro he is good in comedy overall i enjoyed it
<START> seriously any film with john malkovich is usually very good and this includes clint eastwood rene russo john mahoney frasier dylan mcdermott the practice and many more great actors br br clint is getting old now but thanks he is also an awesome director in his own right br br we are used to wolfgang water films like das boot poseidon and perfect storm this was really different but just as sublimely directed br br the premise of the assassin is as serious as it comes the film is well paced some of the violence is a bit but altogether recommended but not for kids
<START> separate lies changed my life actually the q a did br br spoilers below read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it br br the emily watson character cheats on the tom character my first reaction to the puppy dog eyed emily was it's over dump her bad riddance for some reason he stuck around not in a pathetic way he just listened and tried to accept her needs at times he needed to leave but he stuck by her and let her live her life but i still wanted to see her br br afterwards julian the screenwriter and director talked about the film i'm glad he did because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me br br tom's character loved her and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants he would always love her the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie all of a sudden just because she wanted to be with someone else the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was when you get past fifty there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger you have to try and make things work because the alternative may be much worse br br she needed what she needed and she couldn't help that he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be he helped her in pursuit of her lover even when it hurt him br br another thing julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt br br again the strongest tool of a controller is guilt br br at the end of the film tom released her from her burden he felt a need to let her know that he loved her but not to in order to get her back he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship just because it ended in such a terrible way br br it is not my way to review a film based on the message rather than the execution especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director but i make an exception here as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film br br the execution of the film making was a nice british pace rupert was slimy and revolting tom and emily were their usually solid real characters
<START> maybe you have to be a former hippie to fully appreciate this because aside from some dated fashions music and dialogue it doesn't really have a thing going for it nowadays br br four fun loving college art students enjoy carefree days of painting nude models and riding on motorcycles they take acid in one scene and go to a zoo a sign flashes on the screen that says do not feed the animals and suddenly they're in a cage laughing and hanging from a chain tire swing an evil artist larry swanson tells in flashback how his art career was almost ruined because of a crippling hand disease he sends out zombie henchmen dressed in black to kidnap people then injects them with a serum that distorts their faces he's trying to create some new form of abstract act i'm guessing here the details given are a bit fuzzy to put it mildly meanwhile jason ross harris sets out to save the day after his friend scotty chris martell is killed and his girlfriend janet is kidnapped i thought the zombie make up in zombie lake was awful but wait until you see it here it's by douglas hobart the star of death curse of a small role is played by brad the director of the z classic blood freak which is much much more enjoyable than this deadly dull turkey aka nightmare house br br useless trivia note the 1984 regal video release features the wrong cast for the brides wore blood printed directly on the video label br br score 1 out of 10
