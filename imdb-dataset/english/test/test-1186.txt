<START> this is one of t v 's greatest mini series it comes to life almost as well as the book did also the cast was outstanding to play the roles i'd recommend this movie series for anyone who likes the civil war or the history leading up to it
<START> how can stuff like this still be made didn't seinfeld arrested development the office etc etc kill this old fashioned unfunny crap off apparently not br br i'm actually quite a fan of michael rappaport and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles copland friends but in this he sucks but anyone would struggle with this script br br my wife enjoys it but she's brazilian and if you've ever seen a typical brazilian sit com you would understand why she would think this so funny br br just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with her i guessed what the next 3 or 4 plot developments lines would be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word i felt very smug this annoyed my wife as she hates it when i do that can understand why but i felt good so screw it
<START> the first full length film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half hour show which aired on television br br wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught of course as in other wallace and gromit films things don't quite work out as planned br br similarly to a close shave there's a love interest for wallace in this case the village lady posh and a big mean villain with a bullish dog gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny and of course peter provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fit br br and as in a grand day out cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along br br on the negative side this film is a little on the long side there are great effects and some pieces which make you sit up and watch but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature length
<START> if you are among the imdb audience that put high fidelity in the all time top 200 then this movie probably is not for you this film is as as steve frears is self consciously hip renee zellweger is excellent as a hip urbane magazine writer who returns to her suburban bucks county nest in order to care for mother streep who delivers yet another hall of fame performance william hurt is ideally cast and the feckless faithless and egotistical husband if this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh then you are much too hip to enjoy it
<START> i was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout i am a horror fan and i see almost everything in that genre but dead line managed to freak me out the pace is very cleverly set and andrÃ©s does a good performance as a desperate man what is underneath the main plot a trip to madness how can you end up like that martin sanders ask him self while he sees a homeless speaking to him self alone in the street close to the end of the film the character of aaron mandel asks the same question while he sees another homeless doing the same thing not knowing yet that this homeless is martin sanders answering the question of the beginning of the film the broken eyeglasses in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division of personality the ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made
<START> the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler because there is not much action in fact br br great one br br is it for my peculiar interest for the and is it for the atmosphere of the movie or is there some more magic if yes it is for sure the utmost human one br br this film is no doubt extremely artistic artificial depends on taste i can imagine most of the people who hate to watch slow movies and those of tsai ming liang who i didn't enjoy other times are one of the slowest that i know suffering during the movie yes people are unable to slow down and to let time pass and to watch it without feeling they waste it one can take this piece as torture or as a therapy br br the topic at the surface the lack of communication even if we live in rabbit cages one next to each other but not really together people are tired sick of something and unable to describe it just don't want to meet touch talk confront the others like if they had disappeared the big block of flats looks void and the rain falling constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside and sometimes it must be something abnormal unexpected some unwanted decay as a hole in the floor of concrete that allows us to reach each other br br one of the possible ways to look at it is this don't survey the inner world of the characters consider the whole movie space to be inside of yourself and ask why is it there where could these depressive states and moods come form is there a place for them they don't have a right to be here and search for the answers if you need them among the walls and halls of the block instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a man br br the key to understand is not to understand to let a movie borrow us as a subject of study inside itself and at the end safely return us to our more colorful and normal looking reality br br then maybe you will reach like me the feeling of real possible non pathetic hope that in core we are still humans and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world
<START> let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts and did fairly well in their roles but the movie lacked any real plot it seemed so up in seeming that no interesting story ever shone through also the camera work was often sloppy attempting camera work and failing miserably most of the time shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing perhaps something was lost during translation but some of the characters were just stupid the crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog ok overall a fat stinking 1 10 not worth your time
<START> there have been several comments already on the site focusing on the prestige feel of the film and there is a lot of heavy weight talent on show from fiennes and scott thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring to the masterly direction no wonder that andrew lloyd webber's acceptance speech for evita at that year's oscars began well thank god that the english patient had no songs in it writing of oscar winners takes me to juliette binoche who in a stellar cast gives a beautiful performance it is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for best actor often going to showy display aren't at work in the female categories just as emma thompson's hugely well deserved oscar for her portrayal of margaret in howard's end proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of goodness involving so binoche's win proved that it could be that and seriously sexy her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty
<START> first i have to admit that i have had some doubts about the director he has done some movies with about the recent czech east history or more precisely about families individuals how did they survive some historical moments but it was always like the food sour sweet this movie was totally different it was pure it shows the bones of life it shows the variations of human natures this film is an excellent piece of art story acting picture music but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don't want to see by the way i have saw it on a dvd with english subtitles but i am afraid that in the usa i wont be able to get it
<START> this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow up on but i'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show to have a show that centers on the topic of politics you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show something like the west wing or commander in chief rob lowe was ok but actors like kyle chandler just couldn't act he was awful in early edition it was a pain to sit through this show with its lack of suspense urgency and characters who can actually act i just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so i would have nothing more to miss br br grade d
<START> poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed special effects are cheap best performance is by yvette but that's not saying much story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard br br there is little suspense and even less action there's one car chase that's not bad but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time
<START> saimin br br usa the hypnotist uk hypnosis br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format dolby stereo sr br br following a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated an experienced tokyo detective ken enlists the help of a young psychoanalyst goro inagaki who believes the victims were acting on a post hypnotic suggestion but their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work linked to a young girl kanno whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse br br based on a novel by this densely plotted mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources italian gialli traditional japanese ghost stories etc though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence the recent commercial success of hideo nakata's ring 1998 for all its ambition however saimin is a routine potboiler which stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening the are particularly impressive despite some feeble cgi effects though director masayuki who co wrote the script with yasushi rallies proceedings for an extended finale in which the startling secrets are finally revealed is best known for his film adaptation of novel turned video game parasite eve 1997 which also starred leading man inagaki a member of japanese pop group smap and while saimin echoes that movie's strong visual sense it falls short as drama and most of the characters are mere ciphers undermining the emotional pay off which is a shame because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic set pieces most notably a concert hall sequence in which 'new world' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder and is well served by an excellent production team however those lured by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed the film is long on atmospherics and short on splatter br br performances are varied due to the script's limitations but kanno tomie is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder which the subtitles on the print under review assures us isn't recognized as a viable medical condition in japan who falls prey to a sleazy tv hypnotist takeshi a prime suspect in the murders inagaki is bland in a one dimensional role and he's constantly upstaged by a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the series of the 1950's br br japanese dialogue
<START> well i was hoping i'd heard wrong about this film as i'm a big fan of ruggero deodato and really didn't want to see him slip up but unfortunately this giallo styled supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as i'd been lead to believe it would be and that's pretty terrible the plot doesn't work at all as the film attempts to blend murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and it all feels very forced and silly furthermore the plot doesn't make much sense at all and you have to ask yourself what's the point numerous times throughout the movie the plot focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being terrorised by a telephone the best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful english actress charlotte lewis and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop there there are a handful of deaths scenes some of which are gory but all of which are incredibly stupid the one that sees someone get killed by coins sticks out especially in that respect overall i really can't recommend this to anyone non deodato fans are unlikely to impressed and deodato fans are likely to find the film depressing avoid
<START> a heist film with jean reno matt damon and laurence fishburne sounds great on paper i suspect it must have done when someone green lighted the production of this movie but the end product is terrible br br the story is dull the action boring and for a film that is only 88 minutes it seems to just drag on i could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better i should have been doing any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps br br sigh i'm a huge fan of jean reno but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this there are so many other great action movies around go watch one of those and let this movie be best forgotten
<START> i heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie but he himself would describe it as mental horror i strongly subscribe to that br br it is not clear why he travels to this place but everything there is monotonous no bright colors no honest smiles nothing personal everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life our hero though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself br br what makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays you have to function you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses you show off on your wealth your car etc and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have naturally in this film you see neither children nor old people they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers br br i would recommend this film to everyone and make sure that this utopia does not come true
