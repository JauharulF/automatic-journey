<START> potential viewers be warned the current imdb viewer rating for tomorrow at seven is an anomaly of low voter turnout it has an interesting premise a killer leaves an ace of spades calling card at the scene of his crimes while alerting the victim in advance the execution falls flat however and to say that the movie has it's share of plot holes would be to imply that there actually is a plot br br chester morris portrays mystery writer neil broderick weaving elements of actual murders by the ace of spades killer into his latest novel broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book but first he has to get past the man's eccentric secretary if you line his relatives up you'd have enough nuts to hold a ford together that line unceremoniously him to the daughter martha vivienne osborne who offers to make the introductions br br broderick meets thornton drake henry stephenson just as the latter is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a courier that morning the only remaining pieces as we learn in the following scene form the bold black shape of the ace of spades containing the words at seven tomorrow night now what person putting together a puzzle doesn't use the pieces with contrasting colors first br br initially i was intrigued by the appearance of frank mchugh and allen jenkins in their roles as a pair of police detectives summoned to the drake residence generally their characters are colorful enough to offer genuine comic relief but here they're just plain annoying mchugh's clancy in particular winds up shouting objections to inane comments made by his partner dugan and both usually head in the opposite direction when real trouble might turn up br br now here's a question in light of the identity of the ace killer why would he have invited a novelist and a pair of cops that he just met on a flight to his louisiana plantation especially when at seven o'clock all parties would be a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder is committed it's not drake however who's dead but his secretary austin winters grant mitchell the early suspicion falls on pilot henderson cornelius keefe following a lights out scene but henderson still hasn't reported the murder to his supervisor until well after he arrives at drake's plantation with everyone else can you imagine anyone trying to get away with that today unless your name was ted kennedy br br with the cause of death yet to be determined the local coroner is called in but the first one that shows up a broderick accomplice is a phony yet when the real coroner shows up he simply disappears immediately after in a second dark out scene a letter from the murder victim austin winters is about to be read it winds up missing when the lights return and because it may point to the murderer it becomes a clue that must be retrieved so where was the letter winters' daughter martha grabbed it and placed in on the mantle of the living room how much thought was put into this br br obviously the entire affair is so inane that morris' character solves the case rather easily even though the film comes in at just about an hour it becomes almost a chore to watch with all the nonsense going on there's really only one humorous moment worth repeating while aboard the plane the detectives have this exchange dugan hey clancy how often do these things fall clancy once br br except for mchugh and jenkins i can't say i've seen any of the other players in films of the era though i'm a fan of most b grade mystery movies from the '30's through the '50's fortunately the pair fares much better backing up humphrey bogart in a goofy 1938 gem swing your lady where the laughs are intentional the best i can offer about tomorrow at seven is a quote from martha winters about midway though this turkey this is just a silly waste of time
<START> review is of the original 1950's version not the restored 1980's one in a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run off a portrait of the king who loves the shepherdess kills the real king and takes his place a huge bird the of the title acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers br br this is a strange strange movie no surreal very very very surreal br br the style of the background is very european while the characters are meet warner but early arty warner of the non major characters they move in both realistic and cartoon like manners br br this is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but peter ustinov as the bird is a riot his kids and the puppy are wonderful there are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile br br and there is deep philosophy in the film about the existence of a world out there out beyond a metropolis subterranean city br br this is a really neat movie there is something just so odd and unique about it that rewards you if you stay with it for the whole ride its not perfect but what the hell br br this is a movie to search out if your local bargain dvd bin has the version paired with alice in paris buy it it should run you under ten bucks probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things
<START> vhs i have watched this over and over and loved every minute of it so much so i have now ordered the dvd i only wished the film could have lasted longer i never worry about what other people think i prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever make up your own mind and don't let others put you off i have all jane austen's bbc series but this is my favourite i see there is to be a new northanger abbey released in 2007 which i will buy when it comes out but it will not stop me watching northanger abbey released in the 80's
<START> firstly let me make it clear that i love aircraft and usually any film with them in is worth watching and i've sat through some shocking ones however the same is not true of this film james stewart is an excellent actor but he is wasted in this strategic air command promotional film the acting is mediocre and the direction is weak i had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through this was despite some really good maybe even the best aerial photography the trouble is even for an aviation nut like me making something out of the shocking aircraft featured b 36 and b 47 just grates on the nerves too much it's a shame that the film wasn't made when the b 52 appeared then the superlatives used for the aircraft in this film would have been valid then i might have been able to sit through it perhaps i'm missing the point of the film which may be the angst suffered by loved ones while their beloved are on active duties in any case it could have been done much better recommendation well worth missing
<START> during the brief golden age of the super 8 magnetic sound home movies we purchased a projector for 00 on close out at a downtown chicago camera store it seemed that was getting out of the camera projector business although they would continue with their other enterprises such as the former vue master 3 dimensional color slide viewers br br little did we know nor anticipate the rapid approach of the video camera the betamax the vhs and the eventual dvd revolutions with the super 8 magnetic sound camera that we also purchased we took some sound film records as our daughter first holy communion and her younger sister michelle's graduation from pre school this was all circa 1979 82 br br during this time we also purchased a few daddy toys to go with it like some super 8 magnetic sound laurel hardy films and w c fields' shorts from blackhawk films davenport iowa we also picked up a columbia pictures home movies sound film of a then sort of forgotten classic cartoon gerald united productions of america columbia 1951 it was the hit of our home movies time br br being members of that baby boomer generation the wife deanna and meself had recollection of the character of gerald for gerald had a network tv show on cbs early sunday evenings ca 1955 bill goodwin was the announcer host but we had never seen this original upa theatrical cartoon nor was it known to us that the young master was a creation of dr seuss of grinch horton and street fame br br the staff assembled was very talent rich and deep the outstanding production values are apparent director robert cannon and director john hubley were veterans at the top of their craft writers were theodore geisel dr seuss himself phil eastman and bill scott br br mr scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to upa but for being partners with jay ward in such television properties as rocky bullwinkle mr peabody fractured flickers george of the jungle hooper and fractured flickers with the jay ward productions he was a writer voice man and kibitzer general of the whole company br br the cartoon receives its only voice from the narrator radio movie tv actor marvin miller remember him he was michael anthony on the tv the millionaire don productions cbs television network 1955 60 br br bold color schematic and imaginative design went into giving the upa animations a special feelings of loneliness fear apprehension and eventual triumph and we might add the animation is definitely of the limited variety br br as with so many great stories ours starts out with a simple premise one's being born different in this case it is young boy gerald who has been born to make sound effects in communicating rather than talking kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so flattering nick name by a group of youthful chanting your name's not it's gerald the noise making boy at this point the animation team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional gears in the young outcast from happy carefree to isolated lonely and finally to depression despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding not even to his mother and father br br a frighteningly fashioned dark scene involving a highly upa stylized run away scene involving a train and an equally stylized brings gerald right to the brink of absolute despair but then he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young gerald is wanted by the producer of some radio program to provide the sounds for the show down at the studio br br once the premiere show is done with gerald starring in the sound department he rides off in a huge limousine which seems to have anticipated those s t r e t c h limos of our day to the cheers and admiration of his classmates and the world br br it has been said that there are only so many plots and in that case this story is most likely a variation on the ugly duckling for after all a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness br br note united productions of america or upa for short was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the animated cartoon they were responsible not only for gerald and several sequels and a tv series but also the highly popular mr magoo theatrical cartoons and subsequent tv show with voice talent of jim backus the classic original tv cartoon of frosty the snowman and the rather bizarre dick tracy cartoon show with tracy's voice rendered by mr everett sloane
<START> as others that have commented around the web i'm a 130 pilot in the coast guard having said that and being the skeptic i am i went expecting the over the top cheese factors there was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accurate br br i watched the trailer again today after seeing the film yesterday i've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes this isn't the case br br the movie is truly more character story driven than action the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with is revealed further into than movie than costner's is br br of course there is a minor love story no surprise there but for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old wounds br br as girlie as it sounds costner and as much as i try not to like him kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie br br as critics have stated you've seen it all before top gun officer and a gentlemen etc but what movie hasn't been remade a million times br br i can recall only one f word being spoken and can't really recall any other language br br the movie is 2 hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the end br br you'll laugh you may cry but i can honestly say it was worth the 4 i paid br br i hope you enjoy the movie
<START> i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film 9 5 unfortunately it looks like i am not alone br br the film is slow and boring really one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high br br unfortunately this was not the case so when watching the film and seeing the poor story and acting i am left giving it a 3 10 score br br vinnie jones is superb in lock stock and also snatch and he plays a great hard man however he should stick to this role its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films they just don't work br br neither can he play lead actor he plays better as supporting or otherwise when he plays lead his acting talents are too 'in view' and shown up as not really very good mean machine is another good example of this
<START> be warned the next time you see richard kelly involved in any production run away fast br br kelly proved to the world after his last movie tales that he is one pretentious director it was indulgent and convoluted in the box not much has changed br br i can picture what his pitch to warner bros must have been and i bet the executives at the studio ate it right up a full feature film based on one of richard twilight zone matheson's old short stories br br big mistake do not read any further unless you want this movie completely spoiled for you br br norma cameron diaz pushes the button br br turns out that arlington steward frank langella has an alien using his body as a vessel to conduct experiments in which the fate of mankind rests his face is scarred because he was struck by alien lightening which killed him but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing obviously since norma pushes the button knowing full well that someone may die she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own in the end she and her husband james marsden choose to kill norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind br br kelly dances around his film's message trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is obviously any person with a brain is saying at the beginning what if i was the person who dies richard kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal human conversation in fact they avoid it all together they appear to both be educated working at a prestigious school and also for nasa so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to look outside of the box br br if he had the main characters actually have this conversation the entire movie could have ended right there instead we have to watch weddings go on forever nasa and the nsa be complacent to arlington stewart taking over these government programs teleportation to show marsden life beyond our world so it will be easier to kill his wife and controlled by steward which can be anywhere and nowhere at any time br br the most painful part of this movie is the pacing nothing really happens its a muddled mish mash of ideas that are laughable br br it is insufferable how this film is being marketed the commercials make it look like saw and even use the music from those films to sell it in reality what you get is a slow dull laughable yes half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects and messy film which is neither imaginative interesting nor cohesive at one point cameron diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly she is back in the big black car with her husband on the way home where did she go why did they take her do we really care not anymore you won't br br by the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters you will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end go see anything else that's playing don't waste your time or money
<START> i have tried to like this show i really have but i can't find a reason why anyone would like it the story lines are weak the acting is weak and unbelievable every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie lynn spears to be able to move on to movies every episode shows zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date she's always perfect and no one is like that in real life how can people relate to a character that is just a barbie doll jamie lynn's acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series all the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better i'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch
<START> have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film br br granted part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew 'i walk there everyday ' 'i work there ' 'i've had drinks there ' 'hey that's our postman ' etc but still if you're out for a 'feel good' with a bit of spice excuse the pun this is just the right answer relationships culture and most importantly love are all woven together within the plot br br with preston where the film is set recently being made a city it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north br br fabulous
<START> what's the matter with you people john dahl from rounders and unforgettable too quirky knocking emma thompson and alan rickman for having fun playing against type and somebody liked the gingerbread man br br i rented this not knowing anything about it and found it about as nifty a video find as you can get never insulting well thought out funny scary i disagree with the naysayers clearly i thought the story itself was unremarkable but the great cast which most likely means the director was paying attention lifted it to super cool status good sound design also much more appreciated in surround but i'm not bragging and yes i'm a girl so maybe it has a slight female slant the guys in the gang are pretty worthwhile all in all a 9 and a hearty recommend
<START> the director is sweet as is his co directing wife but their movie sucks it has its moments and some pretty girls but there is too much of everything amÃ©lie meets breaking the waves meets pauline at the beach you walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens be it in movies or in real life instead you get a suicidal writer a neurotic actress and an illegal immigrant come social worker with a heart of gold it feels like there's more than one truly touching story hidden in the script but at face value it's a truckload of wasted story lines and sentimental bullshit hard to sit out as it is
<START> i think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the east german regime the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti fascist protective wall it is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed i would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape it did not happen in or around berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the berlin wall the escape balloon was flown over the iron curtain which not only divided germany but it divided the whole of europe at that time the balloon took off from 170 miles south west of berlin in the german democratic republic east germany and flew 14 miles to in and freedom in west germany the opening of the iron curtain in hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the berlin wall later that year whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from east berlin other parts of the or other soviet controlled states
<START> i honestly expected more from this movie that may have been the problem there was not one time when the camera was still ever on close ups the camera shakes the subjects move and i get a headache the cuts are so often and so fast that the viewer often finds himself herself wondering what just happened look out spoiler alert and at the end of the movie when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on they end up losing to me this was a basically terrible movie wrecked by a camera man with adhd and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot
<START> this is a pale imitation of and a gentleman ' there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest the dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed it's too long and the climax is anti climactic i love the its men and women are fearless and tough the action scenes are awesome but this movie doesn't do much for recruiting i fear the script is formulaic but confusing character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault costner's is raging against the dying of the light but why his 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money's worth
