<START> does anyone else think that reba is basically a ripoff of roseanne just look at the characters from the two families connors roseanne and harts reba the blonde bombshell elder daughter becky connor and cheyenne hart who's married to a moron mark healy and van montgomery the sarcastic brunette younger daughter darlene connor and kyra hart the little brother dj connor and jake hart and the quirky relative jackie connor and barbara jean booker hart br br and then of course there is the biggest similarity reba hart and roseanne connor reba tried to copy the sarcastic and tough love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as roseanne had or perhaps they made her too lovable for reba hart seems to waver between being mean and scary hence van's line to his wife cheyenne i'm not afraid of you i'm afraid of your mother and being sweet and caring with little transition in between roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind since she was always mean and sarcastic and whenever she tried to open up it was hard for her as inconsistent as character is it's hard for her to be believable br br but even if the characters weren't completely ripped off of roseanne nothing could've saved the show from being sub par in the plot area the writers try to give the show substance but they really can't lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact and you'd better believe the jokes are corny it's as if they were written by a twelve year old who thinks that any joke is hilarious while occasionally they come out with something that's funny i don't pretend that i didn't laugh at a few episodes these gems are too few and far between to make reba witty br br overall reba is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of roseanne sub par plots and sub sub par humor and let's face it terrible acting the show might be a bit better actually if they replaced all the actors especially reba herself who is more community theater quality than prime time sitcom quality br br i give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in
<START> back in the cold and creepy early 90's a show called family matters aired and became an instant classic the trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts to sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a lovely little stealing is wrong parents are right show so that worked out fine so warren had a new ambitious plan making the exact same show again br br here's the difference though family matters had step by step has the guy from those kickboxer sequels nobody saw he says things like and the dane meister and somehow the audience is still not supposed to hate him i mean seriously how can you even get that across your lips br br the rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole winslow bunch combined with some more one or zero dimensional characters like the dumb guy jt well eddie the smart girl laura and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty in theory the character development was just awful in this show grover and the cookie monster have more depth than the lambert family everybody just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth they weren't worth much br br powered by a massive laugh and cheer tape stolen from something funny this show aired for a whopping 7 years which was humiliating for the competition although you'll have to note that this is the time where family sitcoms were pretty much all big hits everybody just ignored their because well it was the 90s one more crappy show didn't hurt
<START> one of mccarthy's best this movie is filled with sex and nudity it has gorgeous sexy women and some sexy settings br br believe me there are many spicy and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women we have outside settings a hot tub beds of course and some other nice places to have sex br br monique parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl is amazing she's extremely sexy and performs in at least 4 hot sex scenes my favorite is when she has sex during a picnic or something like that she has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out renee rea also has a sexy sex scene where again she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies br br the most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending it's a double sex feature that has to do with hottub sex intense sex and kelli mccarthy receiving it real hard so loud that the couple in the hottub feel interrupted the scene is long steamy very explicit and fun my favorite from 2001 br br the other good scenes include getting it on the woods really kinky then dressed as a bride br br renne rea always super gorgeous dressed like a skater girl has a steamy sex scene nice br br please watch this movie if you enjoy b soft core sex it's among the best from the new millennium i had a blast with it
<START> great music but ain't these people pathetic a true period piece of the trippy sixties and it left me depressed the director paints the wrong side of the life and it stings as a nest if the culture of the time led people to do these things it appears to me that it was all a journey of no discovery only despair i tried really tried to like this film but these people aren't anywhere on my page yes it would be nice to see the world go away for awhile but i always plan to come back drugs aren't the cause of these characters' downfalls it's their lousy attitudes Â these guys passionately drink their cup of poison they cheapen their lives and in the end cheapen the journey that is life has romance ever been so dark br br cheers interesting scenery wonderful soundtrack by pink floyd br br caveats dated drugs depressing thoroughly unlikable characters they aren't flower children br br only for the curious since most packages swoon the pink floyd connection rare floyd tracks many will have never heard before as fm ain't what it was br br rating two stars
<START> this movie is one of the most memorable films i have seen i went reluctantly with a turkish friend who recommended it i am not a very enthusiastic proponent of music documentaries but when a kurdish woman banned for years from singing in turkey sings her piece the theater was in awe i would give my all to hear a cd recording of this haunting gorgeous song and she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded speaking of their experiences of performing in istanbul even now a month later i remember the footage of singing in an acoustic auditorium and i try to remember the music as it echoed in the cinema well done to faith akin the director of this film and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city it would certainly encourage me to visit istanbul
<START> louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters played by jason who is in for jason who wisely declined to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here and i saw cover up aces iron eagle iii toy soldiers and jaws 3d what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working as i look at his post oscar win some of his better movies include iron eagle the punisher and the principal considering that the latter two movies have him co starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work of course enemy mine and remain his best post oscar win work br br out of 4 bad
<START> house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before namely that universal's three most famous monsters dracula frankenstein's monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism then what can only be described as a coincidence sees lawrence talbot a k a the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelman's daughter but talbot really is serious when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf the wolf man throws himself into the sea where he ends up finding frankenstein's monster br br overall this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster dracula's plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end the wolf man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film the acting is good enough with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy glenn strange is given nothing to do and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman overall this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror but as silly monster movies go house of dracula is worth seeing
<START> this movie was in a box set with 20 others with varying quality i can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heap br br it is pointless to go through the plot what there was of it picking out what was wrong as i haven't got all day life is to short which reminds me i have just lost around 85 minutes of mine watching this tripe br br the acting was diabolically bad in a way that made it funny though only just whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any laurel hardy fans groan one of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic t ts which would have been okay if i hadn't had to watch them bob around whenever she on the screen br br the lowest i can give is one it probably deserves that for having heather thomas in it as she was certainly sexy shapely though her acting was as bad as everyone else
<START> we chose to see this movie as an alternative to the polar express showing at our local imax theater what a waste of time and money first it is not cute the snowman at times looked demonic other times he was simply a zombie he showed no expression or emotions most of the time and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy br br secondly santa states in the beginning it's a movie about the spirit of giving santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving i'm all for a little parody but this just wasn't funny or entertaining br br the idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute not even a thank you to santa br br the only funny parts of the movie were the outtakes at the end of the film too bad they didn't use them in the movie it would have been better
<START> what is it with studios like paramount that have a proven hit film series on their hands and figure it can screw around with the budget and formula paramount spent less on this film than they did on which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there's a 10 gap between when the films were made the 40 cost to make would be equivalent to about 75 million in 1989 this film is the reason that shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films as well every time he turned around the studio was slashing the budget and making demands regarding the storyline the fact that this was the one storyline that roddenberry and shatner could agree upon for the most part made the freshman directorial task tough enough but after all the machinations were done all anyone ended up with was an uneven story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series much less a major motion picture the most glaring examples all of the effects were severely out and fake looking the shot of the enterprise going into the great barrier was so obviously a still frame shot being zoomed away from at least the popsicle stick that held the enterprise cut out up was successfully matted out god chasing kirk up the mountain they may as well have just cut in shots of godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of godzilla 1985 and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion off of the film to make electric bolts come out of his eyes at the captain kirk yes friends i have a real problem with the look of that last scene especially br br thank goodness star trek vi was such a redeemer of a film
<START> the brave one is about a new york radio show host named erica bain jodie foster her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves she has her great fiancÃ© david andrews whom she is planning to marry but one night while erica and david are out walking their dog they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates leaving david dead erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on and can barely cope with real life anymore she buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection but one day she's shopping in a store and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead it is then that erica shoots and kills this man and she becomes a vigilante killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others at the same time detective mercer terrence howard is tracking down this elusive unknown killer and in the process becomes friends with erica erica begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people but is unsure of whether or not what she's doing is morally right and as her and mercer become closer he doesn't even realize the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him br br jodie foster gives a very good performance in the brave one she portrays this type of violent morally corrupted character brilliantly terrence howard is also great in this movie both have excellent chemistry together and strengthen the film to a certain level the brave one looks visually pristine and conveys some brilliant camera work but not all of it works to a great effect the scenes where erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world the camera swayed back and forth to the sides in an almost dream like way and really captured the moment with essence whereas almost every time erica killed somebody everything just had to go slo mo and show her facial expressions in fine detail the slo mo was properly used when erica committed her first murder but why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder the camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film but there a few scenes here that are just plain overkill br br the brave one is very much about how these murders affect erica emotionally her fiancÃ© is killed by a group of thugs and suddenly her love of new york city is turned upside down she realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city and she says so on her radio show i don't completely understand this though erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city and that's pretty stupid if she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane murderous people she really doesn't even have to go look for them they just to come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong doing the brave one deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first and then suddenly it glorifies it the ending is very negative and completely immoral and inhumane it also negates the purpose of terrence howard's character which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop and suddenly his morals take a u turn the morals in the brave one become very fractured and just plain shatter all over the place by the end so violence is okay it's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance i pretty much refuse to believe that you know why because i have a conscience which this film surely lacks it is not right to take the life of another person no matter how bad they are or how much you hate them erica bain sets out to stop these evil doers but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills br br jodie foster and terrence howard provide a lot of strength for this movie the brave one contains a strong message but that message is both immoral and wrong this movie may look pretty well acted and intelligently strong but it becomes pretty rotten by the end i give the brave one a 1 5 out of 4 the message is very out of line and morally incorrect and really can't be saved by the good acting
<START> i have never been a great fan of oliver stone often because i have found his films to be forced preachy and generally flawed the two stone films i truly like are jfk and talk radio yet talk radio takes the cake for being stone's finest achievement stone is a director whereby you are either a fan or you are not it is safe to say that before watching talk radio i was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry though after watching talk radio some of my perceptions have changed talk radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as reality tv br br talk radio follows a self indulgent dysfunctional determined hysterical outrageous and perplexing radio host named barry who hosts a controversial late night radio show in dallas quickly becoming well known for his bold and quirky air presence he becomes a late night sensation whereby depraved junkies delinquents racists sociopaths sickos perverts and morons call in to be ridiculed on air the film shows the rise and fall of the man's career carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech originally adapted from a stage play the film attaches itself to the theatre theme that it was originally built around wonderfully conveying the film's fierce nature br br with the ferocious energy and non stereotypical air talk radio brings all the hilarity behind crass media it remains even more poignant today than it was in the late '80s the film goes into depth studying the likes of arrogance self obsession offensive behaviour controversy hypocrisy and ignorance the film shows through a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech yet it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully blunt stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial importance in life but is something that we should be wary and cautious about the film asks the question of is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show br br stone fabulously creates the film's key set piece the radio station with an ambition and cold atmosphere he then succeeds in capturing the isolation fear ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that are built up at the radio station eric bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated self absorbed and complex genius barry he fits the role perfectly letting off his lines with such enthusiasm urgency perplexity brusqueness and ultimately the bold hilarity of his offensive nature the performance brims with spark which was evidently robbed of an oscar nomination his voice suits the character being that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting along with tragedy and comedy works brilliantly br br there is a strong use of editing in stone's films and talk radio boasts some of his cleanest most rhythmic editing he uses beautifully controlled camera techniques which differ from being calm to suddenly becoming turbulent there is a vibrant energy behind the film with its raw and wonderfully delightful script working as a centre piece for the greatness of the film the striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio most impressively capturing the city at night not forgetting the hauntingly heartbreaking and yet darkly funny climatic spiral to decline is ultimately remarkable cinema br br talk radio is an essential modern masterpiece i am certain you will be surprised by just how great it really is i highly recommend talk radio for anyone interested in media or film talk radio is a fine example of top notch intellectual and insightful entertainment which still packs a well earned wakeup call finally if it was not for eric bogosian the film would not be the fun delightful and enduring masterpiece it is today
<START> we enjoy a film like fame because we imagine we are there ourselves music dance and drama students enjoying our self expression this film had humour entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to have a go at the performing arts bravo fame certainly worth 8 out of 10 br br chris
<START> although bullet in the brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film and it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot but after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place there is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast a slightly more relaxed pace and a less po faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit despite these complaints there is no denying that bullet in the brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short and even full length films the makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and hollywood action
<START> alas it seems that the golden times of stylish italian cinema have sunk into oblivion and the recent brainchild of celebrated filmmaker lamberto bava is yet another obvious proof to that assumption br br i felt lucky to watch many films from this prolific director like body puzzle delerium macabre and both demons albeit not entirely satisfying they have never been that dull br br a suspicion that this new entry to my dvd collection was money thrown to the winds arose shortly in the aftermath of the car crash scene exhibiting an awkward and unlikely position of the body under the flip over car br br and the sense of shallowness grew up in the course of the ponderously narrated chain of events that followed br br dumb dialogs suspenseless script and a total waste of talents from the international cast the only character that provided more or less passable performance was the mischievous mark's son up the entire boredom br br unfortunately mario's son job on all accounts could hardly be hailed br br i look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully expected to be an improvement
