<START> looking back on jim henson's works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time for unlike most so called creative types attempting to sell to or worse yet cynically exploit children nowadays jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child and if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this labyrinth aside it is 1979's muppet movie filmed as an allegorical story about how henson came to work in children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half hour show of his own on primetime television the muppet movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s and as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of the muppet show is on offer here i have said it in other comments but i must say it here a great light in the world went out the day jim henson died br br the muppet movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes in short precise strokes we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors and when the story proper begins boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment the rainbow connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the muppets especially kermit were these were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show they were living things based upon a part of all of us only writ so much more boldly than we are used to as each muppet was introduced to us in turn we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character hence everyone had a favourite when animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal i knew i had found one of mine nowadays i am more of a swedish chef fan but what the hey br br complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities can you picture that shared an insight into dr teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of henson but the most relevant song to me was gonzo's number asking what he is and where he came from many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and like gonzo saying we knew we would be going back there someday not that all the songs were so deadly serious of course and kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent or lack thereof and hit the road if any evidence were required that present day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable this number would be it never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another with the and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game the human cast had a lot to live up to br br which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal cameos literally pepper the film with everyone from steve martin to telly savalas popping in to offer their support even richard pryor the last man one would expect to see in a film about the muppets appears to set up a hilarious moment mel brooks' cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when i was a small boy but i suspect that is because henson knew why i would find it disturbing now the big acting strength though comes from charles durning who as doc hopper embodies everything both henson and his audience determined to resist at every junction hopper comes to either offer kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind or perhaps offer stops being the right word when hopper's attempts to ensure kermit's compliance become progressively more forceful and violent the whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world br br of course animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend in point of fact animal turns out to be the best friend that kermit has in that moment and that has been the core message of every good show or film henson has been involved in ever since that shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes there can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities henson's creature workshop could never have got off the ground to misquote the album title daring to be stupid is one thing but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter the muppet movie demonstrates how henson dared to ask us all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box there will never be another entirely like him but he never would want us to stop trying br br therefore the muppet movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film if we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated this would be it
<START> it was riveting i just could not look away as the movie rolled on i started to feel that it was powerful and confronting but i had no idea how much more intense it would get br br the movie gives an insight into what unfortunately is everyday life for a lot of school kids some of us live outside that environment and would walk by and not know what is happening br br parents need to see this film in particular just to see a glimpse of what their kids go through often parent dismiss their kids problems as trivial but unfortunately to a high schooler they are massive and unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedy br br definitively a must see for all
<START> og intense and enthusiastic is a documentary like story of a male choir up in in the very northern part of norway where the weather is cold and hostile the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities br br the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves the people in the choir who are aged from 30 to 95 all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to br br the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet r the bathroom the kettle on the oven there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings everything is as real as can be br br it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story it is very beautiful and real but why do we see it is it because of the songs is it because of the nature or is it simply just to see a story about mens choir about their life and some of the trips they have the message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir the choir have kept the people together for many many years br br it is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost 200 000 in norway there is something wrong there is no beginning or end to it nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great why was this movie made br br i am sorry it is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average european scandinavian or norwegian movie this does not deserve a 9 out of 10 it is closer to 4 out of 10 and that is what i will give it br br if you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55 60 it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb it is a movie about elders for elders it is a movie of i regret nothing in my life and a story saying that living in a small town like might be a nice life too

<START> while in madrid i was able to see a screener copy of this film wow gallo is amazing in it very unusual performance he gives aside from gallo's genius the film however is a dull a film i have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on laughable i am also a val kilmer fan so he was part of the reason i made such a grand effort to view the film the problem is val is really only in one scene having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast i have only seen stranded of the directors other films both films are far far below average but both contain very interesting vincent gallo performances if you are as much as a gallo fan as i then see this film regardless of how bad it is if you do not like gallo then there is zero left to love
<START> anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find dogtown and z boys adequate research material this is not to be confused with lords of dogtown that sorry hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original dogtown revival br br directed by stacey peralta a former z boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s bones brigade and co written with skateboarding photojournalist craig this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from southern california's mean streets known as dogtown who formed the z boys skateboard team actually there was one girl peggy revolutionized skateboarding the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z boys chris cahill's whereabouts are unknown with the most being bad ass tony and the youngest jay adams who's talents along with seemed to transcend the rest of the teams there are interviews of the team's and the dogtown shop founders surfboard designer jeff ho skip and craig there are also interviews of folks like tony hawk obviously ian and henry rollins who were young kids in the 70s when dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains br br it really shows you not only who the dogtown team was and how they formed but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks pool skating became popular and thus gave way to vert skating but also facilitated the sport though not into the extreme commercialism it is today as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding the days of russ howell and alan were long over as the dogtown at least through the publicity of their skate team paved the way for the new generation of skaters because dogtown got all the attention they were able to push skating to the next step br br it's a great documentary in the way that it is put together though stacey peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the bones brigade mini movies skate like ban this and search for animal chin narrated by sean penn the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack contains lots of terrific archive footage and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the z boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding
<START> viewed this the other night on cable on demand and thought this is the type of movie that might have starred alec guiness and glynis johns if it had been made in the late 50's a farce in the english tradition alfred molina and brenda blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portrayals naomi watts simply sizzles in a ditzy jayne mansfield ish if she could have acted way rest of the cast have some great turns and bits the welsh landscape is delightful an absurd premise indeed and not at all believable but that doesn't get in the way of enjoyment not a great movie mind you but a truly fun watch and walken is at his wacky best a joy to behold
<START> i did my best to watch this two hour fiasco it combined the awful special effects and plot of the original blob with an execrable boosting of the outstanding in the original screenplay of runaway train the only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they'd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch what an incredible stinker lou diamond phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part no matter how bad barry corbin continues his career as a typecast creep a u s senator from texas and plays it well he should next do the lead role in the story of trent lott or jesse helms the women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the fay wray memorial screaming contest special effects are unbelievably bad h s kids in film class in north dakota could have done a better job the writers must have pulled a heist at the clichÃ© bank to accumulate this many i couldn't watch any more without being forced to sit in the clockwork orange chair i have no idea how it ended except obviously minutes too late ugh caveat
<START> this show was incredible but too esoteric for most people if you had never truly seen a european variety show in the 70's or 80's or at least a mexican one the entire show would probably be lost on you if you had this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst helmed by a chain smoking suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra glamorous and harridan of an ex wife viva variety is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in fighting and acts gone very wrong the hosts are joined by johnny a dim witted side kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him which of course they don't br br the result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general imagine the arguing that probably happened backstage during the last days of the sonny cher show now imagine it's happening onstage in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure now add cheesy acts and a euro mentality gowns booze accents and smokes now you have viva variety br br have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians too conceptual viva variety did this for comedians way too esoteric for the standard american audience it was funny as hell and doomed
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and i watch it from time to time still i've used it in my music classes at the school where i teach the kids seem to enjoy it although they wish it were in color br br the best thing about this movie is for me who grew up after had died is the chance to actually see the master violinist work his craft i was surprised at how up to date the story line is although references to reform school are outdated a boy whose father had died and is being raised by his mom and stepfather most of our kids today are being raised by although the movie makes it seem like most are cruel i get very angry when his mother doesn't take his side and defend his actions against the step father br br also the musical selections are difficult to believe i find it unbelievable that a child who looks to be about 8 can play the minute waltz or that a 13 year old girl could sing an aria from rigoletto br br other than that it's a really fun feel good movie and i do recommend it i wish it would come out on dvd
<START> this is a ravishing yet spare adaption of thomas mann's novelette of the same title dirk bogarde gives his finest screen performance he himself believed so the dialogue is minimal so his face must register the nuances of his anguished character a composer a writer in the novelette the only major alteration who travels to venice in 1910 visconti revels in the portrayal of beauty it's passing and the whiff of decay beneath trained as an opera director visconti blends music and imagery seamlessly in his finest film since the leopard another stunning film which greatly influenced coppola's sicily in the godfather
<START> this movie moved much too slowly for my taste the concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally retarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen on screen however the execution of the concept was flawed each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way that is each character about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie which i found to be a form of emotional and social retardation i suppose this has artistic merit given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above average intelligence friends and family the acting however was well done without exception i agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful in summary i think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described
<START> wow what a strange film it's a david lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird br br i defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film i can't be done after some research following my second viewing of this film i pretty much know most of the story but on a first look and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help it is hard to figure things out so if you're in that boat and was confused don't feel bad that's normal let me just say the key to the film is naomi watts' character br br at any rate i find the film fascinating i love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch the camera work is excellent and the music is creepy a la lynch's blue velvet there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes in all it's very well scored br br like lynch's twin peaks television series this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since lynch thought this film was going to be a long drawn out tv series when that didn't happen he pieced at the last minute this ending that may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear br br the theme of the story supposedly is a negative comment about hollywood and what it does to people especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed br br both watts and the other leading lady laura are very interesting to watch especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene looks wise both women were looking average at times stunning at other times br br i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first it's not just a curiosity piece it's a very intriguing movie just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things
<START> okay i agree with all the barney haters on this site i think barney and his friends are all ugly looking and obnoxious and the show is very lop sided and unrealistic br br but the thing that ticked me off the most is how barney presented gays lesbians and on his show when talking about same sex parents and relatives that wouldn't be so much of a problem if the creators of this show didn't use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals i mean not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink and not all lesbians are ugly and manly looking with a bosom that sags to their abdomen as a bisexual female i just think this is terrible for a children's show if this were south park i wouldn't mind it because south park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality a lot of people who watch barney are little kids or handicapped people who can't usually distinguish fantasy from reality br br and now that i think about it barney sort of comes off as an ugly gay stereotype himself let's see he doesn't have a girlfriend he's pinkish colored and wears clothes with sequins yes it's true on it if you claim to be for the rights of gay and bisexual individuals then stop making a mockery out of them in front of people who don't know any better if barney went black face and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time the show would be pulled off the air before you know it br br i give this show a negative one out of five don't show your kids such hateful crap there are children's shows out there that are so less insulting
