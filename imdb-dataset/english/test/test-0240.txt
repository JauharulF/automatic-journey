<START> darling lili is fantastic its by far one my favorite films it certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received julie andrews playing the title role of lili smith schmidt is the best part of the whole movie she is entrancing and spectacular as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is this movie is just great i'm running out of adjectives it's magnificent marvellous amazing funny terribly romantic sad and just an all out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews and to her husband director blake edwards oh yeah rock hudson was ok too br br julie andrews is the beautiful and well loved singer lili smith rock hudson portrays major who quickly falls for lili and she with him but their affair was not there meeting was planned by the german government i'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them but you get the point because the warm happy singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy lili is told to seduce major in order to get information of the new top secret later know as crepe suzette though lili is on a solemn mission she falls in love with bill major for real making her original quest challenging but lili pulls through and completes er task after she finds out something that is not really true about bill the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out if anything you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie i most certainly did br br
<START> i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be fights or shooting cops robbers cowboys or indians it was definitely not a cool film to like so i didn't see until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful captivating films i have seen all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story my two favourite scenes are birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end directed and edited to perfection the quality and phrasing of jenny voice when she calls my daddy ' wrenches emotion from the viewer tears are welling in my eyes as i think of it br br this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to of an emotional experience
<START> this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen i really enjoyed the characters in the movie they are all wonderful bizarre in them selves it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie br br the story is almost non stop from beginning to the end there are no boring moments i was totally captured by the movie and i thought the acting was great br br so if you want to see a fun movie you should look for the green butchers a great movie br br i give it 10 10
<START> this is a family movie set in 1950's rural america about a boy whose uncle presses sheep killing charges against his dog drum starting not only a family legal feud but community discord as their town begins to take sides br br this is formula film that attempts to be very touching and sweet its biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were scott bakula defense lawyer ron perlman father owner and the dog john and kathy garver sissy from the original family affair as the uncle and his wife were okay the children were not that good basically they looked like they were acting and that's a problem when the film really revolves around them aaron who plays the bully donny makes me think of what the actor russell crowe must have looked liked as a child only with no talent but a lot of ham br br favorite line spoken by the prosecutor after scott bakula's defense closing trial speech we'll be lucky if they don't lynch us br br favorite line spoken by ron perlman after his son punches the bully now making him your friend that will be the hard part br br cute enough to rent buy used
<START> now this is classic a friend of mine told me about this flick saying that it's incredibly lame stupid retarded and moronic he also said that i'd love it br br to my surprise i found it available from netflix and rented it at once i'm just shocked that i had never heard of it before if i could give it an eleven i would br br
<START> this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie and a the oldest that obviously is still in existence this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the more treasures of the natural archives dvd br br it's only a 15 second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder next to him are two men dancing near the end another man walks on the stage william dickson the director of this experiment is the violin player this movie had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success it took over 30 years from this point to the synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment however this was a start no matter how primitive it came off br br for more of the technical information and history of this film process see the other review here by boba
<START> my first exposure to japanese animation director hayao miyazaki and his studio ghibli production company was when an english dubbed version of spirited away was released about 7 years ago what a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was so on that note i managed to get my movie theatre employed friend to see this new film of miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things disney this movie's u s distributor once again all i can say is wow what awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to and seeing how some characters' demeanor changes and well watch this movie if you want to know what i'm talking about oh and the voices being used for this american dubbed version tina fey betty white liam neeson cloris leachman and lily tomlin good choices all does everything make sense no but that's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout there's plenty of funny scenes concerning and the boy and many other people they encounter oh i think i've written too much so i'll just highly recommend hayao miyazaki's
<START> i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh how could some one have actually talked like this not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors antonio sabato jr flew a 747 like a pro and michael team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time did anyone notice the lame tribute to fantasy island with the guy saying boss the plane to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sight br br the only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a crossbow hello br br the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum just for laughs they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 hurricane on neptune atoll did i hear michael pare calling it the best honeymoon resort in the pacific now that would make an interesting movie
<START> wow this was a real stinker this early sci fi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp there's so much scientific mambo jumbo in the dialog it's laughable the female character played by osa is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood boil the only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the moods of the film the special effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie with some good b stars in the lead roles the acting isn't too bad but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge the challenge of not laughing their heads off
<START> the elegant documentary br br don't watch this movie if you're an egotistical know all student of physics this much less than one percent miniscule fraction of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know br br do watch this movie if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99 of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity quantum string and m theory br br what a brilliantly architected documentary starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic and dimensions beyond i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade br br the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini series split over three shows it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence br br we are all and everything around us is energy with a natural tendency towards harmony this movie may blow your mind or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us even with the telescope and far far smaller than the and within the atoms we learned about in high school m theory holds many magnificent of br br it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting out of the realm of science and into the realm of br br you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god br br bravo brian greene well done indeed br br p s if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the quantum mechanics blended with spirituality of all things can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch what the bleep down the rabbit hole yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before my eyes process light reflections just fine i see things everyday that i've never seen before and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't divide but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do there is a lot to like about this film br br then watch the secret 2006 documentary about the law of attraction search for imdb title this information just might change your life profoundly forever if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought if you'll listen and some are and that is truly incredible there is a modern day jesus mohammad buddha those among others that history suggests have communicated with the non physical alive today and she lives in texas i know some of you know what i'm talking about br br i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now
<START> i want to preface this review by saying that i have no idea what begotten is truly about all i really know is that in the beginning god kills himself in turn birthing mother earth who proceeds to impregnate herself with god's semen she then births a son the rest is pretty subjective and you have to interpret it in your own way br br how i chose to interpret the film was this god killing himself signified the start of the scientific revolution when people started questioning the doctrines imposed by the church like the view of the universe and etc mother earth symbolized people starting to think for themselves and reject the church's it happens like this because god says so views the tribal people were the church lashing back at them trying to force christianity down their throats i'm not exactly sure how son of earth fits into all of this mother earth and the tribal people seemed to be fighting over him so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something to that effect br br i have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean bludgeoning raping then dismembering mother earth and son of earth and grinding them into the ground like a mortar and could mean anything but that is where the fun of this film lies you can interpret it any way you want there doesn't have to be a definitive meaning to it you can let your mind wander sometimes you don't even know what you are supposed to be looking at because it is shot in a weird angle or it is too fuzzy br br the only thing that disappointed me was that i was expecting a truly terrifying film i was going into it thinking i was going to get a phone call immediately afterward with a foreboding seven days warning what i got was pleasantly different it was not scary at all but it stirred my imagination trying to decipher the movie's cryptic message was a creative challenge there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful mother earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path come to mind br br so overall i would have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film it is certainly the most abstract movie i've ever seen but that's not a bad thing
<START> i won't be too hard on this show because i enjoyed the first season but then things got worse the concept is nothing special just about a girl named casey who is trying to cope with a new step brother derek and his loud crude family while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them br br in season 1 the story was actually interesting i liked casey back then because she was smart strong independent and conservative she was well mannered and deep i felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step brother she was a perfectionist but not as annoying as the later episodes oh and she dated a nice guy who is now currently portrayed as one of derek's idiot friends the season grasped the true tension the title of the show was trying to capture br br now i can't say the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting but i root for derek now instead of casey now there is little if any interaction between the two siblings if they interact it's only briefly oh and i don't want any fans in my face people that's called incest even if they are step siblings my tolerance can only go so far but that's not the point br br it's strange derek as the antagonist has gotten more sensitive over time while casey the supposed protagonist is more neurotic and unlikeable than before i like how the younger kids get more airtime but the parents are even more clueless than before but that's not the biggest problem br br unfortunately we are forced to see everything from casey's point of view with lame nauseating background music she has gotten stupider and more shallow over time in one episode she got whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous so she purposely dumped food on herself and blamed derek now what happened to being a strong independent feminist i haven't watched much of the fourth season but i hear she is dating a guy named truman who is a jackass and is arrogant oh i remember that fencing episode she constantly reminds him she doesn't like him freaks out over being by a sword and in the end hooks up with him because she can handle him what the hell why go with a guy like that in the first place the 1st season casey would have just punched him in his never mind or maybe that would have been my reaction oh and she's a cheerleader not that that's a bad thing but i think she fell on her head at one of her practices and in a prom episode she cried because she couldn't find the dress in her dreams and wasn't completely satisfied until she became prom queen one thing i've noticed is that no matter how bad casey tries to tell us her life is thing's almost always go her way in the end she gets the guy she wants derek gets some kind of revenge people all love her etc derek is still quite immature but i see that he really has matured i don't see why many people hate sally she seems nice and it's good to see derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than playing the field he is also treating edwin slightly better and is a good brother to marti br br really the show is so so and i rated it low because despite some character development the character i once admired has now become like any fashionable teen queen you can see anywhere on tv but it was good while it lasted
<START> although i could sum this pathetic episode of night gallery in two words those two words being horse manure i am obligated to write a minimum of ten lines this is a very sophomoric episode not worthy of the standards of rod serling but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy the premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon a lifeless orb to be sure is totally ridiculous as is the construction of a giant mousetrap i suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive i can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes first aired on that date all in all a waste of film actors and air time
<START> this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles the shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing antonio sabato is horrible i mean even worse than normal how does this guy work the directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films i love shark movies and this one just disappoints i've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work i'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story
