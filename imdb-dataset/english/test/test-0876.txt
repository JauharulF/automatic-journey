<START> as everyone knows nobody can play scarlett o'hara like vivien leigh and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable all others pale in comparison and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions one thing that i really couldn't get past was that joanne has brown eyes the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett's good looks and in this sequel she has been stripped of those br br the movie as well as the book had several lulls in it the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever it could be that i'm only 11 but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up if rhett hadn't told her that i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude she really loved cat her baby she likes this child best because she had it with rhett her only loved husband still if you've read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in scarlett's world br br quite frankly it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together and scarlett took way too long to get to that it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind but then again what isn't if you have read the novel you will like that better than the movie br br i would watch it just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile it may not satisfy you entirely but it will get you some of the way there
<START> and there are not many in cinema history rouge seems to be a bit of a hope hope in mankind and in life but to say only that may be naive kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the but wise model perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident but what to say about this master of the camera you can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors ms jacob and mr are perfect it's not only this movie but the downbeat thou shall not kill and a story about love that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist's point of view pity american public the average one could not see these films at least they are not in the maltin's dictionary and even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man abel
<START> pure schlock from beginning to end the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination otherwise it's a pure camp fest endurance test like one of those so so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say br br you'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by the numbers romp however it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag king prostitutes a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them how's that for role reversal and lesbian soap operas the ghost of valerie lives
<START> this should carry a government health warning if you play it in your dvd machine you are in serious risk of opening a rift in the space time continuum and disappearing without trace into it so bad is this 'movie' br br the fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern hollywood cinema and the continual commissioning of films that appeal to the common although i truly dread to think of the common that this film actually appeals to br br i think hollywood were just conducting some kind of proving trials when they made and screened this film i can imagine the executive boardroom meetings at the studio just how bad a film can we actually get away with making and still make loads of money holy cow i didn't realise we could go that bad br br the only films worse than this that i can think of and trust me it is close are die another day rip the bond franchise as i knew it and independence day br br avoid avoid avoid
<START> i really enjoy this genre but the cell was one of the worst movies i've ever been unfortunate enough to watch while about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing or left entirely i was dumb enough to stick it out the main problems with this story there were too many to list all is that with this type of film you have to do two things one provide fear of the killer being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone and you must give the victim whose life is at stake the girl in the tank enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not not only did i lose track of the girl i was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when i did remember she was part of the story i really didn't care what happened to her while the visuals were interesting in an lsd flashback sort of way they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story see phantom menace for another example finally does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky ridiculous
<START> carrot top in a full length movie enough said only reason this doesn't get a one is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10 and this is no extreme ops horrible god awful there are some movies that are so bad they are unintentionally funny then there are movies that make you physically unwell and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide burn all copies of the movie shoot anyone who had non creative input on this movie torture anyone with any creative input and as for the star there are only so many things that can be said online but he should be begging for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head by the time the work is done
<START> this is such a fun and funny movie highly entertaining at all angles it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts we got the judge the sargent the kid the creepy old lady the slut the clown and unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous we also learn a lesson along the way never give your patient an ax br br this was before nest and surpasses it at least on the fun level it even has its sweet moments love is pure love is grace love is strength you love me your love is pure you'll always love me now who could resist that nuts are humans too just a few loose wires be a little careful or you'll get an ax in the back children at play hehe br br the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine all the characters in this film are tremendously well played and i really did find them funny no hilarious they may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them or how they can take advantage of you br br this is actually a very smart movie there is a brilliant twist ending i must say i expected this to be a good but never expected this it is horrific the court has made its decision you are no longer in control i love it the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear br br i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this i will never forget it now it is not just a cult it is a cult classic whatever you do don't look in the basement
<START> i don't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die houses burn down car crashes babies die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings its so depressing i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or house shall we torch in a months time ' br br its the most depressing absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore
<START> though not a huge fan i am a three stooges purist i believe that their best work by far was with curly as the third stooge and their earliest films are generally their best that's because after a while they began remaking their films and the gags started to get stale here in 1934 they were still rather fresh in more ways than one and funny br br here they boys play very improbably roles respected doctors in a hospital the three run amok acting silly hitting each other and scaring the pants off anyone who expects to get better the non stop energy and freshness make this one a must see for fans br br by the way although i liked this film i strongly recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny educational pictures nifty nurses is much like men in black but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era better even than laurel hardy's county hospital
<START> surely the best film directed by claude lelouch after c'est the jacques life inspiration is really present richard and jean paul belmondo played a really amazing duo and are really great in the psychological discovery of the two characters they are playing
<START> i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works e g linda grant's when i lived in modern times usually from the israeli side of the fence also a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year so with such a recommendation br br however i actually found myself nodding off at points admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes i went with it but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film i liked the concept of a restrained almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter but personally i think the film has been over hyped i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything it's definitely not but even a little more dialogue would have helped
<START> this is a really cute movie i had a massive sleepover girls 10 11 and they absolutely loved this movie they watched it twice don't let the rating fool you you have to be 13 or older to rate a movie on imdb that eliminates the movie's target audience if you have a girl or boy between 7 and 13 i guarantee they'll enjoy this movie br br sort of a gender reversed notting hill set in high school aaron carter plays a famous pop star who is failing his privately classes his mom sends him to a regular high school with the ultimatum pass high school or no summer tour taking the advice of his manager former pop star david cassidy he befriends the smartest girl in school alana austin with plans to cheats off her look for the humorous and insightful janitor another former pop star garrett
<START> this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot br br i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavy handed and self reflexive it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident alters nelson's career course and mayhem ensues br br the attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing comedically or otherwise br br overall it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness
<START> i caught this about the most unlikely success from a lower league football team the plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns intercut with shots and commentary from the 70's i was taken aback by its shear fun br br a great cast includes the excellent tim healy as the crazed drunk manager bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win i keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that don super united and england manager loved by the fans hated by everyone else has on united the men which in its detailed report of their opposition united in this the fa cup final merely says sh te br br lots of other gags a long time before the fantastic feature length mike basset football manager starring ricky tomlinson br br up there with the gung ho english beating germans at football well morally although the score lines says different of escape to victory i still cheer when england score br br and the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in micheal golden gordon from ripping yarns series with terry jones the team were called united in case your interested br br i've looked high and low for a copy of cup even nick hancock's biography doesn't list it probably someone not mr error br br play it again or sell me a copy please
<START> this was the best film i saw in the year 2000 the cohen brothers have never let me down before and they certainly didn't this time either br br it's one of those rare movies these days it's witty intelligent and vastly entertaining i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart of course there's lot of cohen stuff in there odd characters and peculiar gadgets well developed plot and magic camerawork but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film if you overlook the general quality of them of course br br the big surprise for me was that clooney is so good but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blake nelson but the rest of the cast is superb too br br a film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music dripping with wit and intelligence thats a very unlikely combination but it's exactly what this picture is
