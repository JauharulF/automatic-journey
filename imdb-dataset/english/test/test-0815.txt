<START> this was a great anime true the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than ninja scroll the problem that it was kinda long br br japanese movie star hiroyuki sanada who played from last samurai played the main character and it was directed by rintaro who did galaxy express 999 and metropolis br br the anime has some good animation for an old anime interesting characters like the main villain and ando and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film br br all in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime animation in general action and samurai ninja flicks despite the lows in the film that didn't the film from being a great film to watch br br don't miss this film
<START> i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie and finally an european one so maybe my expectations were to high br br it begins with a good quiet horror shock sequence but it lets you down right away in the following scenes where the plot begin being introduced as the acting and the motivation life of the characters reveals itself no better than any 'made for tv' drama it keeps that way right into the end br br about the horror part of the movie it is certainly a good idea and a different one but all the scenes are of the it before' kind br br overall my idea of this movie was that it had a good concept which was inserted into a mediocre story bad acting and less than tolerable plot holes br br
<START> i really liked this film not so much for the story which was okay but was a bit slow moving in spots but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of greece and the greek isles susan sarandon is utterly engaging as the carefree love interest of john cassavetes a man on the edge but the scenery oh oh oh
<START> most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by arthur miller that is the basis of it it's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives br br at the beginning lawrence newman is an ordinary man the eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him little by little there couldn't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than william h macy not only is he a talented stage and screen actor but he projects honesty behind every character he plays he is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities his anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job suddenly he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the brooklyn of the 40s is he jewish is he not the cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film directed with sure hand by neil kept reminding me of some edward hopper's paintings especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies laura dern david paymer and especially meat loaf who infuses incredible depth to the bully next door are excellent but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of william h macy h must stand for honest if you haven't read the book i would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than arthur miller has
<START> just finished watching the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend something i never do needless to say i was very disappointed the story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey first off i am not a mm hater i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3 4 times yes we all get it that he a good looking guy with a nice body but i think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3 4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary i think one time would have been sufficient it wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unless enough about that let's get into his role i feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner but his lines were corny and cheesy it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times in short i didn't like his character even though i was supposed to the accent his shirt off corny pick up lines weak sales pitches his character was just too much of a tool as brandon or jonathan pacino and assante were great but that' no surprise piven is fun to watch as arie i mean jerry i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly it's insulting that they could take a great story and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success 1 cool story that appeals to the male man 2 hunky hollywood actor for female women make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights 3 al pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 great one liners 3 every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4 jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school 4 throw in armand assante to seal the deal 5 plot good writing character development and intelligent casting are unnecessary br br this will be good enough for most people but not me anybody who disagrees with me ask your self this would this movie be much better if a directed by sodeberg b decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm br br i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants big budget crapola

<START> persuaded by the 7 0 points in imdb which is pretty good i decided to watch this movie however i found this movie quiet boring about 2 hours and full of clichÃ©s a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc tamer karadagli is quiet funny in this movie dialogs motions etc you will have to see it he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies perhaps copied too much i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch unfortunately yet again i'm convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a 4 its too boring and full of clichÃ©s
<START> the movie was very good i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that please know that while these poirot movies are good they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp ms lemon and especially hastings david suchet is definitely poirot i have seen every actor who's played him the worst was peter ustinov
<START> this movie rips off of every mobster gangster film ever made mp da last don has a reference to every movie the acting was by far the worst i have every seen who the hell is john mario anyway his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen he makes bad actors look good as far as master p goes he's selling out quicker than an n sync concert i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company what the hell were you thinking when penning the script obviously these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to distribute this film so it seems and how predictable that the guys at no limit had to start no limit films i've said enough this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie
<START> critics love this movie i personally found it senseless and tasteless this is the millionth time i've fallen into the critics love it trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie there are many scenes that are completely unnecessary a warning to animal lovers don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested br br if you want to see a good asian film see afrika if you want to see a film about escaped convicts see the gene wilder richard pryor classic stir crazy avoid 9 souls like the plague
<START> i bought this out of curiosity how did john carradine who died in 1988 and cameron mitchell who died in 1994 make appearances in a film made in 1995 thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years that's how you can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting jack o the curse of ed wood lives on the good thing for both carradine and mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies same goes for scream queens linnea quigley brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith br br the setting is crossing on halloween and some kind of curse is released when dumb beer guzzling teens disrupt a grave the result a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head he it goes after the wholesome kelly family for revenge and kills others who get in his way the father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood kiddies the son ryan son of the director has one continuous perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave at least he's a kid the mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue there is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue br br so what about the name actors you see stevens wildsmith and mitchell briefly on a tv screen they're used to pad out the time linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with it her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit there's also one out of nowhere laugh when an ultra conservative couple who watch a rush limbaugh clone on tv bite it the woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife she's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame broiled muppet br br all and all pretty entertaining stuff i wasn't bored
<START> barbara payton is the suppose to be sultry sexy young hot wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a back lot set at a cheap studio in hollywood raymond burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who mrs payton is desiring to blow the joint with there is another girl some sort of peasant slave thing that burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory old doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the payton tramp i watched this only part way through because its really awful so didn't even get to see the star of the show which i guess is a gorilla that the doo hag turned someone into or whatever who cares i give this one half star out of a possible ten it's not even campy just really bad
<START> a space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space the crew investigates hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship however once aboard the ominous vessel their own ship mysteriously leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or orloff as this creature calls himself br br not a bad start i mean it follows any number of typical sci fi horror plots the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film but when you start with a fairly typical horror convention the legend of dracula and vampires in general and combine it with a fairly typical sci fi convention a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever they're forced to confront the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples br br director darrell roodt who also wrote dracula 3000 with ivan is primarily responsible for this utter failure so no roodt and have nothing up their sleeves but their arms br br this film begins ominously enough with a very poorly delivered voice over by caspar van dien essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are i should also point out that van character is named van helsing and oh so very cleverly this orloff character is from planet transylvania in the carpathian system no kidding i mean come on guys we get it and again don't be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store br br so after van helsing's introduction of the crew we have essentially a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about br br i'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films occasionally they can be brilliant see raimi's first two evil dead films dracula 3000 had a decent budget enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd like van dien erika eleniak coolio etc however unlike the evil dead flicks there is no talent behind the camera in front of the camera the talent is marginal but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt it really seems like they don't know what to do the best actor of the bunch alexandra kamp gets killed off quickly and the ever enjoyable udo kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal grant is also okay as the professor but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair and yes it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it as for the rest of the actors i'm sure coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire but well i don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book tiny lister and erika eleniak don't really provide much either lister is never really more then the il' big brawny black stereotype eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard eleniak is a pretty girl even in her mid thirties but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movie's duration br br this brings us to count dracula orloff played by langley to be honest i can't recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be he introduces himself as orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as count dracula as well go figure in any case you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots yes it's that bad langley the actor playing must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit i'm sure he's still getting hassled by his friends br br there isn't much to the plot the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth for some reason and also there is some lip service about wanting to defeat caspar van character van helsing most of the crew get turned into vampires including van helsing and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine yeah that's right bullets and yes the year 3000 keeping in that baffling vein one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires or vampire since there is really never more then one threatening them is filled with old soviet posters and insignia and such what the there are also references to god religion being antiquated systems but these references only confused me did the soviet union make a comeback is there some point roodt and want to make with this it never really goes anywhere seems dumb and the posters etc just look cheap br br on the positive side the film is competently shot and edited the cinematography is nothing spectacular but it's clearly done by professionals and i had no problem with the special effects the ships look like ships in outer space although as i write this i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him what were they thinking why didn't someone say something see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives i guess ultimately that's the thing whatever positives you try and grant this sci fi horror debacle you become overwhelmed by it's lack of quality br br poor udo kier
<START> brilliant work marvelous actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters all unforgettable parts in a more than intriguing and capturing action the casting is perfect both from the side of the stars like armand bernhardt kier denier but as well for new faces i was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy gang member mustafa you trust each one from the turkish gang very convincing is michael and all white power followers i admire the music beat of the main theme of children of wax this sound track is a charming mixture of turkish hard rock and udo and in the same time children of wax a tale focusing on racial conflicts the intolerance and brutality between the skinheads and the turks
<START> alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him br br the main subject of this bullock vehicle all the ideas almost everything was already in hitchcock's classic rope the two students who commit a gratuitous crime nietsche's philosophy and the clues that the boys disseminate the master was the first to transfer them to the screen and with an eighty minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force br br murder by numbers does not take place in a single room like the rope mind you and what a supreme originality it pits two cops against the evil youngsters and you would never guess it these two cops are very different actually bullock plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner chaplin is as shy as a clueless girlie the two boys' performances are not really mind boggling not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear br br well you know rope was so good
