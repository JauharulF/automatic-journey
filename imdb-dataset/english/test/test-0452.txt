<START> this film gets off to a bad start an incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly done truly amazing spaceship crash then things go downhill again as you realize that the survivors are all a bad actors apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath and b almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster fodder hell half of them don't even speak english preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all you feel as if you were watching deep blue sea meets silence of the lambs minus the good bits and unfortunately the entire thing tries to hard to be crashed on a desert planet with hannibal lecter during the daylight scenes vin diesel is a great actor but he is no anthony hopkins and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper cool psycho there is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so br br but then things take a turn i can't exactly pinpoint the moment but soon the movie gets a lot better it also feels less chopped the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative and vin diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show stealer by the time the first monsters appear the film is actually quite enjoyable by the time night falls it is great thrilling horrifying and exciting and even the character development of most main characters is well done if you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some great entertainment br br besides the visuals are eye candy and i honestly admit i love the colour and the tone of this movie br br 7 10 could have been 9 10 if only
<START> every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be br br the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be br br a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b bs and lots of blood br br if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 5 without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation and don't forget to switch the light off br br my points on different aspects br br direction 9 10 acting 8 10 atmosphere 10 10 sound effect 9 10 br br total 9 10
<START> i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it pretty well if you ask me it was a pretty good show anytime i think about it i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> thanks to silly horror movies like troll and the indescribably atrocious cult favorite troll 2 it has become practically impossible to take movies with gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days only just recently i watched the 70's made for tv movie don't be afraid of the dark which is basically a quite terrifying and serious toned film about domestic little goblin monsters and yet i still couldn't help thinking back about the laugh inducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in troll 2 same thing happened to me now as much as i tried going into inhabited with a clear mindset unconsciously i kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of still even without all the prejudices inhabited is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straight to video horror flick it's a cheesy soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and northern europe mythology the annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren't your plain average goblins they are the wicked little norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children this overcomes the russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town the cherubic blond daughter of milf actress megan gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden she claims her friends are fairies and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past gina's parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood when she keeps rattling about fairies they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist dr werner whilst the are slowly coming out of their shelter not much special to mention here the pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute you understand this is a family friendly horror movie so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here heck even the cadaver of the family's pet cat is kept off screen this is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which malcolm mcdowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable greedy and self centered authority figure
<START> amanda bynes is an enormously talented actress and i've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past especially in the fantastic she's the man for that reason alone sydney white was a huge disappointment for me the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters in a good fun teen comedy its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality based teen characters in sydney white this idea is thrown out the window br br amanda bynes makes a fine sydney but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress i blame this on the script which makes her character too bland and restrained and on the hair makeup department which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style the seven dorks that sydney eventually befriends are far worse they are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters they're essentially repulsive gag fodder as is the story's prince charming who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be br br perhaps the film's biggest star to be with the possible exception of amanda bynes is sara paxton who's actually very good as the conniving rachel it's just a shame that the script writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black br br the plot is basically that of snow white what kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re imagining the connections to snow white are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown prince charming is unrealistically charming the witch is far too despicably witchy the seven dorks are too dorky and sydney is just too pure of heart now this is not to say that the movie is all bad though bynes is forced down by the script she still has her moments as does sara paxton who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes room mate named dinky is also great fun as a character it's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichÃ©d to recommend
<START> this is a semi fictional memoir of an international man who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years br br i was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war i was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting however i was disappointed by this film chico seemed fragmentary with the main character ricardo staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes as could be expected no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame the excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained the result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries
<START> what a terrible misfire not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda george segal vehicle of a few decades ago why i wonder someone with the clout of jim carrey will not only star but also produce this tired ugly pointless excuse for a comedy he could be taking comedy to a whole new level instead he goes for what he may assume is safe territory money money christmas but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs i call it uncomfortable because that's how i felt aware as i was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny and failing miserably it could have been an outrageous politically incorrect mirror comedy of the post enron days but no that would be pointing too high too risky what a shame
<START> i think trash really sucks i watched it a couple of weeks ago and i haven't seen that kind of c p at the cinema since female trouble by john waters and that was even worse the dialogues the acting it really stank it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back but actually i am glad i saw it because then i could tell my honest opinion on it one should see this film even though it stinks
<START> stinger starts months on the submarine the ss newark where genetic experiments have gone awry the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions jump to 'camp a couple of months later where general ashford james lieutenant williams john miranda on his mission to board the newark assist genetic scientist dr carly ryan michelle meadows before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists marines are on board the newark are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from dr mike thompson casey clark who doesn't make much sense it's not long before the scorpions attack first to fall is lt williams so sergeant sam harmon christopher persson is promoted takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety end the menace of the giant scorpions forever br br this sweedish america co production was directed by martin he also handled the cinematography i thought this was a strictly by the numbers uninspiring creature feature it's early into the new year stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster creature insect type film i've seen in 2007 hopefully things can only get better the script by mat is incredibly clichÃ©d gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably aliens 1986 lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film there's the scientists including a blonde sweedish one to try explain it all the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life the final ingredient being the monster alien insect or whatever in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers yeah it's all here unfortunately stinger isn't an aliens if you get what i mean it's a touch long at over 100 minutes it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdb br br director doesn't distinguish himself it's not scary there's a lack of atmosphere the action scenes are dull unexciting there's not many scorpion attacks it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse that's for sure i mean that's not to say the effects in stinger are good but i've seen worse there isn't much blood or gore there's some mutilated bodies some decapitated heads someone is ripped in half the only clever amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions however there was a moment which had me groaning tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the circuitry get the lights working by hitting the power supply computer boards with a hammer it works as well br br technically stinger is average at best there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous stinger was shot in stockholm in if your interested the acting was poor there's nothing else to say br br stinger isn't a great film it isn't a great horror film either i can't recommend it at all but i've seen worse if you liked stinger unlikely you might like the similarly themed 'giant scorpions on the loose' films tail sting 2001 or 2006 just as unlikely
<START> stumbled over this film on amazon com had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of german movies i bought a copy br br have to say that i was not impressed the production values are cheap the story is derivative the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs br br i wanted to like this but i just found it lackluster and dull or maybe i expected more of independent german cinema than a gay spin on the full monty and a cast of stereotypes br br there are bits in the film that make no sense at all like one of the leather bear's trying to get in a sling like he'd even look at him twice or the vengeful ex wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband bunkum is not the word well at least it explains the movies uk title i suppose
<START> spoiler terrible camera work horrible writing non existent plot and numerous plot wholes wonderful acting except for julia roberts who poorly plays someone who is impersonating julia roberts poorly catherine zeta jones is adorable in this movie br br during the movie we repeatedly zoom in on each of the twelve characters twelve is too many even for a classic like 12 angry men and the problem is we tediously zoom in on the characters when all of them are in the same room doing the same thing br br yep clooney's eating yep pitt's eating yep the jew is eating yep the geek is eating yep the eating yep mr sensitive is eating yep yep yep yep yep yep phew this happens at least three other times in the movie yep they're all sitting in cars bored yep they're all getting arrested frightened yep they're all being led out of a jail depressed br br but it wasn't until i was home that i realized how badly they'd got me on this one this is a heist movie right that's what i went to see right but when i walked in and set my car keys in the change jar only then i realized nothing was actually stolen in this movie that's right it's a heist movie where nothing gets stolen oh they try they go to try and steal some boring document or something from some guy's house whatever and it turns out it's already been stolen 20 minutes of my life wasted then they try to steal some egg from some museum yawn and they screw that up and get arrested br br then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did and we get all the joy of entrapment except this time the person inside the tight dancing around the fake lasers is an ugly skinny french guy um br br but it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either actually our heroes stole the egg loooong ago in another movie entirely which would have been a great movie to watch had they made that movie br br instead we see a 30 second clip in black and white about how they robbed some college student of his back pack you heard me the daring caper the ultimate heist the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap is them stealing a back pack from a college student by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him and replacing his back pack with an identical back pack what br br ugh i'm telling you this was so bad i didn't even realize just how bad it was just how badly i'd been robbed until i got home
<START> i am speechless honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this cast anyone in the film let alone direct it the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed i am disappointed in flex alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone essay the role omg i think i just insulted the word essay uh yeah i did y'know what the less said about this mindless drivel the better you have been warned nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself watch at your own risk
<START> this movie was awesome it's a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days it has interviews with skaters such as tony hawk my idol and stacy peralta to name a couple dogtown is a so called ghetto part of california where there used to be an amusement park that was torn down people started riding alongside the dangerous ruins of the park soon the surf team was formed that led to first real start in dogtown the z boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as vert skating they started it by skating in drained swimming pools that's just a bit of the story behind it it even contains rare footage from charlie's angels of stacy peralta making a cameo i think you should buy this movie if you are a skater it'll teach you that skateboarding wasn't always popular even if you are not buy
<START> princess warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plot essentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters one evil and one good fight for control of the throne the good sister is being beaten so she escapes to earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t shirt contest the rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister but the younger sister is helped by bob a good hearted dj and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister's ignorance of earth customs and culture the older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again throughout all of this action there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age sÃ©ance to bring the good sister back sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around los angeles and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed the film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending br br it seems to borrow elements from star wars the light sabers and the look of the girls' home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes dr who the phone booth like means of transportation and some of the costumes from the cult on the home planet could have been taken from star trek episodes br br ms dana the evil sister in the movie in another user comment mentioned the endless and dull wet t shirt contest it is seriously the longest wet t shirt contest in cinema history and the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cotton polyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent i couldn't state it any better the only thing i would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying br br most of the acting is pretty over the top but that seems to suit the whole style of the movie the actors playing vinnie and vito were just too much for me i just found them annoying ms seemed to be enjoying herself and not taking the whole thing too seriously in contrast to sharon lee jones who acted decently but seemed to be taking everything more seriously all of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots presumably to add comic relief which is a bit unnecessary given that the whole movie was rather comical br br from a ratings perspective this film had a lot of foul language some topless women and others scantily clad in thongs but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity one sex scene that was portrayed in a non graphic arty dreamlike fashion and little violence while there were threats of violence throughout the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated and too camp to be offensive though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with it br br i have to wonder who came up with the character names a small egg a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scaling skin and an eating disorder with and and another disease br br overall this is a bad low budget campy sci fi action movie but it did keep me entertained though i might need a few drinks before watching it again
<START> i bought the video for at hmv we pay more in britain as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive br br i have to say that the opening credits were a let down the dancing music not very powerful br br the car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touch something unexpected though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most directors but for lynch was something else br br her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard i thought another lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised self conscious after a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation i discovered the new video cassette squeaked br br i dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time and money br br the two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough though predictable there were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes the hoover switching on there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous eg the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner oh and what about the paint in the jewels boring and naff br br this whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius you know when you listen to the worst dylan track ever and think my god that was embarrassing was that really bob br br the whole feel is that of a failed tv movie badly put together with a few not many extra bits to give it a 15 rating br br i it on during the last 30 minutes br br do i give it another chance and watch again if i want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film i will watch frank woods guide to consolidated accounting br br lynch did one classic blue velvet and straight story was nice br br this like wild at heart was a let down his weirdness is now predictable and stale anybody want to buy a 2nd hand video br br make way for some younger original talent david br br four out of ten and no more sorry
