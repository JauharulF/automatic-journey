<START> ya know what family guy started out as something fresh funny and more original the random humor used to be funny i actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to the simpsons after watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks i grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny south park was right about dead on when they brought up the manatees and the idea balls br br and watching the show itself i don't understand why my parents like it so much there's nothing great about it the humor is funny and would've been funnier if the show didn't rely on randomness
<START> this movie just might make you the film was well worth the dark trip to town betty renee zellweger is the lone acceptable soap groupie out there her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof i might even allow myself to get lost in adorable fantasy if it weren't for the fact that dr real name is george and speak of the devil looker greg kinnear fills his role very well while charlie morgan freeman makes you wish for his wish to come true wesley chris rock makes you want to tie him to a chair and rosa tia takes you back to those luminous grade school friendships the sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and loose his name the remainder of the cast fits well never one to do the same movie twice nurse betty is the exception one of these long cold needing to smile about something winter days
<START> i have to say it is a sign that this film appeals to all ages if somebody by right should be shielding themselves away from anything remotely homosexual absolutely loves this thing br br i thought every last bit of this film was amazing and the casting was superb but i have to say anna chancellor where have you been all my life br br having previously seen anna in several other things i was completely blown away by how magnificent she was br br diana may not be the most lovable of the characters but she could certainly take me home if she fancied
<START> dr teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it the thing about him is that he is depressed dr and his wife separated his children are deviant he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn't doing a very good job at healing people he becomes suicidal but meets barbara who changes his ideas for the better all around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside br br the movie is well done and the character of dr is well played out it's a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama it was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what dr was doing great movie
<START> when i bought 4 dvds for Â£5 oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince however i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying 'never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon ' to live by this should sum up everyone's life pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them and then enjoy the watermelon life itself
<START> take your video camera turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie to be fair there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me so sorry i really tried to like it there didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we've got to find a way out of here didn't learn too much about any of the characters so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way this isn't the worst movie in the world open water holds that title for now
<START> i was looking forward to seeing bruce willis in this especially since i remember being mesmerised by the original when i was young br br this movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and dumb it down until it's just another formula ridden hype of the fabled american law enforcement system army vs the russians no sorry the cold war is over make that with the russians vs the terrorists similar to probably 50 other movies br br furthermore it treats its audience like a bunch of idiots the choice of weapon is well plain ridiculous are we seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced hit man terrorist would select that for an assasination br br the whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who crafts a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away none of that survived all we have is the tired old american cia fbi army vs the evil terrorist plot we've all seen 1000 times before br br but of course the movie company's realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them revenue from the short attention span gang so the answer is bruce willis big explosions and a crippled plot they assume the american audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign where is france on the map afterall so it has be an american br br another example of a movie by the boardroom
<START> i love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie however in the first ten minutes of the movie i knew that it was going to be lousy it was poorly acted and much too slow on top of that it was very very racist sexist antisemitic and homophobic sometimes putting in racial ethnic and other types of slurs has a point illustrating the bigotry that exists in this movie there was no point to the horrible bigotry and no one learned from what was being said part of the problem is that it was an adaption of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950's having this movie take place earlier in time would have made a little bit more sense it didn't translate well to modern times and the writing was horrible i don't know how the play was originally written but i can't believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one has made it to television and video in 1999 it was disgusting don't waste your precious time on this one
<START> rob lowe must have eaten up the entire budget but i can't fault him for running with the money even he would have to agree there was nothing good about this movie filming editing direction dialogue sets makeup writing casting especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist and the story all were just the worst i have never seen such a horrible movie pass this one up for any other rental selection or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the tv dead silent should be silenced for all time
<START> this is a film that really makes me cringe in 1951 mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons with amazing animation exceptional backgrounds and great stories then in the late 40s a new style of animation began to appear such as the crusader rabbit series on tv animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money unfortunately columbia picture's cynical ploy worked instead of the public hating the toons as they should have many accepted them and the oscar people ampas actually gave this film the award for best animated short giving legitimacy for an inferior product unfortunately in the dollars and sense world of hollywood this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios resulting in rather crappy cartoons later it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone and for this tragedy i blame in part gerald one of the of cheap cartoons the story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying incessantly is a pain
<START> 1987 br br director dario argento deep red suspiria screenplay dario argento and franco the church sleepless demons photography ronnie taylor a chorus line sleepless music claudio phenomena br br story betty cristina is the lady macbeth of a very stylized staging of verdi's macbeth opera betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum the famous curse of macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise it seems betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her story 3 of 5 br br acting acting in a lot of these italian films can sometimes be hard to judge english italian french german spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge i usually cut them some slack in the area as a result acting 4 of 5 br br direction giallo maestro argento enters again the genre helped pioneer shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore tension and beauty direction 4 of 5 br br visual this has to be one of argento's best looking films gorgeously filmed by taylor features some stunning and inventive camera work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye candy coming the camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house visual 5 of 5 br br audio frequent argento collaborator through his various bands goblin and solo effort compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical verdi to metal musings with a little help from brian and roger and bill wyman and lends music muscle to the screen's bloody the sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the anchor bay disc in glorious 6 1 for every crunch and caw audio 5 of 5 br br technical the editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully combined with the camera work the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing the exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of macbeth one can't end a review of an argento film without having to comment on the kills argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence crow eye gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends argento's ex wife daria to the movie morgue priceless technical 5 of 5 br br wrap up a nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that argento fans crave br br overall 4 of 5
<START> travis james franco is a young man riding a train for business reasons we're to assume who leaves his beloved phone behind it gets picked up by a prostitute terri rachel miner and when he goes to her city to pick it up a series of events occur that are sure to stay with him forever br br both characters have barriers they've put up to defend themselves from communication but despite their facades it's obvious both are eager to bust them down in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines but from the way james franco and rachel miner use their faces you might as well turn off the volume words are unnecessary a scene to look out for is terri staring at herself in the mirror you can just feel her despair permeating the room br br but the movie isn't perfect it's mostly filmed using hand held cameras which gets a bit distracting mainly due to the acting of mr franco and miner and the photography the script's flaws don't stand out as much still sometimes it seems as if the story doesn't really know where it wants to go br br all in all this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it an hour after you've seen it you're still 'what if' ing yourself on the behalf of certain characters it's not flawless but still leaves you wanting more wishing it were at least 4x as long
<START> once again the posters lied to me br br the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content when i read the synopsis for this movie i was expecting to see a of grotesques every man jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation into such a den of vice would come the clean shaven hero shining gabriel instead the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect br br the first few minutes of the film showed us that is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether fiddling a little to make ends meet drinking to forget the pain or watching cock fighting chickens not penises to while away the boredom in other words the townspeople were desperately ordinary br br the only deliberate grotesque in the piece was gabriel the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury if i were kind i would suggest that the rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith unfortunately brian kirk is so inept a film maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty plus minutes of dark hackneyed tedium my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of guess the accent broken up with rounds of spot the location are we surprised that ends up stealing his brother's child and suffocating his father of course not he's a bible bashing preacher and therefore psychotic all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie but i suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to br br the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace superman returns as the worst film of 2006 one hell of an achievement br br v2
<START> interesting topic pathetic delivery script and direction br br our hero miles thaws out and has his emergency world first life restoration surgery this is where the fun begins the underlying issue is that miles has no soul this is used to explain his quasi erratic behaviour of being indirectly responsible for two deaths i believe this to be the total number of deaths in 104 minutes br br on the side miles prefers the odd glass of brandy blazing fireplaces and his young maturing female cousin the finale does indeed do justice to this film br br some thoughts 1 producer were parted with to create this tripe j d was the script writer and a or sole producer looks like he did not learn a lesson on how not to bring an interesting idea to life when one views his other writing credits this will support the credibility of this script br br 2 now available on dvd this is truly scary should be forever bottom of the shelf in vhs format br br 3 a re incarnated human without a soul will default to an evil entity br br 4 the score offers minimal support not even an in form jerry goldsmith could save it br br 5 deserved the time slot on tv and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials test patterns it was competing against at the time of my viewing br br 6 thankfully did not spawn any sequels ala wes craven's nightmare franchise chiller too the return return of miles or something like that br br despite my rating of 1 i still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting or script writing career this should apply to directing however wes craven will eternally be exempt due to his sole good piece of a nightmare on elm street 1984
<START> one of the best films i've seen in a long time precise in its vision and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization i can't say much without giving it away and i don't recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing just see it br br but ah one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on imdb conundrum what can i do tell you about the film nope can't do it i think i enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no preconceptions please you do the same br br i suppose this can be said the acting is excellent and understated and what i have come to love about foreign movies is that the movies are actually about the movies not the stars
