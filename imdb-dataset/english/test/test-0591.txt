<START> this was an awful short film that tries to be funny in a dark way but wasn't funny at all say at a film festival in chicago it really is what the title says and i simply wasn't into it at all the bad storytelling was what did it in if you re wrote it and re shot it it might work this attempt fell in the hole horrible filmmaking
<START> i cannot believe the number of people referring to the lead characters as 'boy there is no such thing people there are cows and bulls and all males in the species are bulls and do not have there was even an actual bull but it was like it was another type of animal completely my god this is like drawing human ears on a cat boobs on superman or mickey mouse with blond shirley temple curls even in animation it just doesn't work giving human qualities to the animals is nothing new to be expected but changing their actual bodies into basically a transsexual figure is bizarre for a family cartoon how many people editors writers producers animators saw this and didn't know any better or didn't say anything it is completely astounding i'm no snob i luv animation simpsons beavis butthead south park even ice age all the other new ones out there over the hedge was great but this is nuts totally nuts i could not accept that that many people are that ignorant i kept hoping for a reason for the in the film an explanation none came and at the end when they hold up this little newborn calf half its belly is udder they pronounce 'its a boy' i nearly choked please writer creator let us in on the joke
<START> going into the movie with the right expectations i somewhat liked this movie like most reviewers who have seen this movie i fully agree that the plot was razor thin clichÃ©d and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie but the dancing sequences were very well done and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip hop dance both which i enjoy watching the music soundtrack of the movie was also very good which made the drama scenes more bearable the leads jenna dewan and channing tatum were ok as actors but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing br br all in all a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences and this movie is much much much better than you got served in terms of the plot and drama then again that doesn't say much does it p
<START> thomas edison may have done lots of great inventions but wtf is this i am sorry but this movie is simply awful the plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point gets electrocuted okay the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper i thought that the early charlie chaplin films were awful okay thomas edison may have been an inventor but why did he make this film he could have filmed a baby being fed it would have been better people might say i'm being harsh on the times but would you enjoy something like this from what i have said edison may have made the but why did he make this particular movie well i might sound like a complete a hole but watch this on youtube then you will see this abomination i still can't believe this film is completely awful all in all the worst short film i have ever seen br br rating 1 10
<START> the subject is banal even in 1942 it is war propaganda the fascists are among us and they are doing all they can to sabotage the war effort and to prepare their victory and their seizure of power then and their establishing an effective totalitarian state but hitchcock has to make it a real thriller so he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims the friend of the one who dies in it becomes the prime suspect and run away for the sabotage that enables him to so to say visit the country and discover the tricky organization of the local nazis who have acquaintances and support in the top benevolent society and use the small little dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work the chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from los angeles to new york and to the top of the organization he meets a blind pianist who believes his senses to know the chap is not guilty his niece who is a star of the advertising billboard but also a frenetic and fanatic patriot who only thinks of going to the police then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters then on the road some sympathetic and friendly truck driver and the long caravan of a circus going around and their dwarf bearded woman siamese sisters and a few other grotesques of that type and he discovers the target in a soda city an electric dam that provides los angeles and its war industry with the energy they need he takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a uss alaska military ship when it is launched and finally with some inventiveness creativity and elbow grease he and the niece manage to get the whole lot cleaned up most of them arrested and the first saboteur a certain fry falls down from the torch of the statue of liberty that one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair but hitchcock is not yet in his habit of having a personal cameo appearance in his own films so don't look for him it's well built and well performed but it is only a propaganda film with an extra style br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> i loved the movie northfork i knew nothing about the movie before watching it therefore i had no outside influence or information to guide me in what i was seeing unfold on the screen in retrospect i would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it do not read anything about the plot story line or evaluation of the movie in fact stop reading anything further in my comments although i believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you i don't want to diminish the value of the movie to you find your own path of meaning in this film or it is diminished in its potential br br in general i found the 3 benign strangers in puzzling as the movie unfolds they could qualify as three entertaining escapees from a mental hospital or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy or three angels sent to find the lost angel br br the sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three strangers to abandon the search for the lost angel become his guardians mother father and take him safely far away from northfork no less than 1000 miles he even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis the other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement br br the priest who is nursing the sick boy demonstrates a depth of caring for people and a deep conviction toward his faith he transcends the desolation and emptiness of northfork and its people he is the light of goodness and hope to both northfork and to the movie viewer br br near the climax of the movie the boy and new guardian journey over land to a field where a plane waits they board to find the other two strangers also on the plane in fact one is the pilot the engines start and the plane takes off br br who are the 3 strangers if only one stranger was interested in helping the boy why were all three on the plane where is the plane going did the other two find the lost angel is there a lost angel and if so who is it who are the six men dressed like undertakers if all of this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams how did one of the 3 strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed like an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head neither the boy or strangers had contact with these men br br one or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake this is not a spoiler it's statement about advertising only so if you haven't seen the movie northfork the questions above show only a few of the interesting and fun forks in the road of thought when you view the film northfork if you read the advertising summary of the plot of the movie before you watched it previously maybe you ought to look at some of the questions above and watch it again i know i will br br terry
<START> i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it i didn't feel the characters at all is this americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates the main character doesn't act like a fundamentalist at all and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine one of the members a blonde all american white boy would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life another member a french ex skinhead doesn't quite fit in an islamic terror movement on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american housewives which i find very strange this is just another stupid misguiding american tv show it is about just as realistic as prison break
<START> i always say there's nothing like a good movie and i must say this was nothing like a good movie drab dull and tedious it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end no matter how hard you try to wake up i don't mind the concept of a film without words ie entering a fantasy or dream world but there has to be something there to capture your imagination not just empty images which is what this film is there seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story was there even a story you could tell the actors were trying their best but unfortunately poor direction sabotaged all the actors' work it really seemed like a type of cinematic masturbation only existing to pleasure the director and nobody else big waste of time
<START> penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseries br br formed in july of 1942 on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as 90 prisoners of gulag political prison concentration camps soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of protocol were all given a chance to join the and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law br br this miniseries features a look at one such under the command of an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative yet honorable crime boss the fist and his little gang of criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his anti semite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the house to house fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fighting br br although set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of soldier and then his execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearing br br the acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps
<START> how good is this film apparently good enough that they plan to remake it in jean pierre melville who gave us le and the good thief wrote and directed this film br br the film is almost a silent these are men of few words preferring to let their actions speak for them they live by a code that governs their every move br br there are some great actors in this film alain delon the leopard yves montand jean de let's make love and gian maria el from a fistful of dollars a few dollars more the film does not shine on them they are along for the ride that melville has for them melville makes the film they make it better br br you see melville's work in the ocean films but they just get the idea the can't make it work like he did a great loss in the seventies but his work remains for our pleasure
<START> this movie surprised me the box is misleading the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading the movie is quite gory well acted and beautifully shot the special effects are top notch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize this movie came out in 1979 not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest it is a unique take on the dr moreau story and one of the better versions filmed the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking but the film doesn't ever really fall apart definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume horror classics and gore fests
<START> do these guys take have a computer kick out these same plots over and over again only the names places and faces are changed to prevent complete boredom hubby is handsome and rich but too busy to pay attention to his gorgeous wife a situation she constantly tries to remedy her friend neighbor has the same problem so they become interested in each others the grass is always greener throw in a sexy scheming made who has designs on everybody and you get a lot of stripping and dipping and a salad bowl of an unintelligible plot br br the quality of bodies is pretty high here although not much in the way of contact even simulated is shown good late night erotica if jay leno can't put you to sleep
<START> this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end ok so i salute boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in burma but that is all he achieves about 10 minutes into the film i thought oh no here we go again and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next 80 minutes or so patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role and her acting was wooden and unconvincing mind you being saddled with such an awfully conventional script maybe boredom set in and was such reflected on the screen a lot of the film was just plain laughable at one stage arquette's elderly companion is shot and he is prostrate on the ground in the next scene he is sprinting through the forest obviously attempting to break the world 100 meters record or maybe he's just trying to run away from boorman if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond on your vcr and you'll be snoring in no time i very rarely a film as heavily as this but in this case it is completely justified
<START> i've sat through less painful operations than the time i spent watching this film br br if you give it a try thinking it's going to be something in the vein of a guy ritchie flick think again the production dialogue acting script film work and plot were about the worst i've ever seen in a film my fave part in all honesty was the closing credits in all the history of cinema has there never been a better excuse for turning off the tv and going out and doing something better with your life br br have root canal work done rather than wasting your time and money on this
<START> i'm giving this film 9 out of 10 only because there aren't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamond's collapse which is a popular book or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie go ahead fiddle while rome burns
