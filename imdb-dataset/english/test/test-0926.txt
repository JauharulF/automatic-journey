<START> the king of queens in my opinion is a pure cbs hit despite the fact that i've never seen every episode i still enjoy it very much for that reason it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite even so i must say that cbs really knows how to make a good sitcom before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance the production design is spectacular the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong in conclusion if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off cbs i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good it's grainy and has almost no color in some parts it switches back and forth between english and french often in mid sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word to make matters much worse there are no english subtitles during the french language parts which i think make up at least one quarter of the film but amazingly the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this condition and i think that says a lot about how well made this film is br br this is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting an interesting storyline and an excellent music score it also has a cool protagonist a beautiful dark haired girl some strange characters and events and an overall feeling of melancholy this film has euro written all over it br br i hope there is a pristine negative or print of this film out there somewhere because it deserves a quality dvd release and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it
<START> in need of work straight man bud abbott as jack and comic partner lou costello as get the latter a job babysitting self described problem child david as donald young winds up reading mr favorite novel see if you can guess the title which puts costello to sleep dreaming he and mr abbott are reliving the story of jack and the you guessed it br br the sepia tone switches to color for the bulk of the production apparently this was an attempt at something different for the duo a colorful children's fantasy it fails but this is where you get to see abbott costello in color silent film superstar william as the king make his last performance a bit part boxer max brother buddy and before disney's spin and marty br br jack and the 4 4 52 jean lou costello bud abbott buddy baer william
<START> after you have seen enough movies there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film i had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later like silence of the lambs it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors like the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure the surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen and beyond this continuity and making sense are not necessary which makes it a film maker's dream too br br the only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons you actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man the focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim
<START> i hadn't heard anything about this project until i saw that it was going to be on so i watched it with a completely open mind and gee the cast is full of strong players br br unfortunately it's awful i don't mean it isn't good i mean it's extraordinarily bad sometimes laughably so but mostly it's just boring its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as us network tv will allow but it's all tease and no substance and having nymphs as backup characters can't justify several hours of bad tv br br there are two basic problems that the cast can't overcome first the script is awful yes making changes to the hercules myth which is certainly not a single monolithic story in the first place is traditional but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb and sometimes downright head shakingly peculiar with terrible pacing bits borrowed from here and there and several parts seemingly belonging in different films and truly awful dialogue the dialogue is frequently unbearably bad in fact to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actors sean astin apparently now typecast as second banana seems especially burdened by one awful line after another there's no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot br br second most of the special effects are really bad really bad there's occasionally a decent bit of cgi but mostly again you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast i have no idea what the budget for this project was but it sure looks like crap compared to clash of the titans or even hercules the legendary journeys and doesn't even compare very favorably with the old lou ferrigno and italian 'spaghetti' hercules movies just painfully miserable br br there are plenty of other problems the story is needlessly complex and can't keep up with itself and hercules himself isn't presented as a very interesting character almost everyone who doesn't have a european accent tries to fake one of some kind which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place drama doesn't become better just because the actors use british accents after all but the terrible script and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right off the bat br br in fairness hercules was apparently intended as a four hour miniseries but truncated for this airing anyway to a three hour tv movie i don't know what they cut but it's possible the edits made things worse i don't think you could make hercules good by adding to it but that doesn't mean that the continuity say hasn't suffered from the network edits there's no way i'll watch the usa version to see though
<START> it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie after all it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the king of depression ingmar bergman in other words so many of bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director br br even though it is more difficult to watch the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity that's because initially the main characters liv ullman and max von sydow try to overcome adversity and are basically decent though a bit stupid people however as deprivation after deprivation occurs they especially von sydow become less and less humane and more animalistic doing anything in order to survive br br fun to watch no freaking way but an interesting insight into human nature br br ps 1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine they finished the wine completely in most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched it drives me crazy as i would never leave a 4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it bravo
<START> totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack i'd give it soundtrack a 9 out of 10 i have the cd and the guitar work nils is superb i saw the movie years ago and had to check imdb to remember what it was about i obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it it ranges from blues soul ballad to a dose of gospel all songs written arranged produced and performed by nils who is the other lead guitarist opposite steve van zandt in the e street band this dude can play the vocals are handled by nils he can't sing very good too raspy bonnie sheridan who is a great singer and tom
<START> bad acting yes but it was not a surprise stupid story yes so what br br but why tell me mr director why all that slow motion crap fight scenes were bad really bad because of slow motion and bad cutting not because of seagal br br what if i just speed this up for 2 seconds and then slow down those next 5 seconds and then maybe i need to flip the coin to decide what were you thinking mr director
<START> although i am a fan of heather thomas and i have a few of her old bikini posters around here somewhere i can honestly say that if the only movie i had ever seen her in was cyclone i would never be able to guess why she had made it as far as she had in show business br br directed by fred olen ray about as good an omen as seeing buzzards circle over head in the desert this tale of a woman thomas who must protect a high tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as b movie as it gets or in fred case b minus br br the cast itself should tell you something it's not every movie that combines thomas with actors the calibre of beswick hall combs donahue tamblyn and landau if you're lucky very few movies do and even though they seem to be having fun shouldn't some of that fun be passed on to the audience i vote yes seems they voted no br br of course if you ever wanted to see heather deliver an to another woman use the f word and get hooked up to battery cables you've probably been looking for this one myself i'll be content with old fall guy reruns br br one star given in hopes that when another cyclone hits town heather runs for shelter i know i will
<START> an awesome made for the sci fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they've churned out bruce campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor stacey keach and his half wit assistance ted raimi the film is pure b movie gold and its great to see keach and ram up on screen with bruce and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on bruce's comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious and makes me ask the question why isn't this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned it indeed a sick world definitely worth a watch
<START> this show sucks it was put on fridays on roller coaster and whilst it undoubtedly destroyed the running theme of friday programming i shall judge it rationally still i think it sucks it really is super lame zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame br br the lame and pot sucks and i reckon the dialogue and joes are weak the weak humour and lame sucky characters suck and the whole show is frankly a disappointment not worth watching it sucks and is really really lame it really has to be one of the lamest shows on tv really not worth watching i mean how lame weak and sucky can a show get before it gets axed
<START> i am a lover of bad movies i own r o t o r and boa vs python and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as troll 2 and what's up but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies it's just lame the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right everything about this movie is stupid when the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction judge jury and executioner the perfect cop but they went too far i mean come on why do people bother making these movies anymore r o t o r makes it because it is hysterically awful but storm trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isn't even bad enough to be so bad it's worth watching this belongs in someone's home movies collection something they can be sort of proud of but that is all i am p ssed off it was on an hbo channel with only 1 star which is why i watched it because it didn't belong there even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie it is shameful
<START> as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing i never really realized exactly what it was it was then with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like arthur dent from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy but cooler i can't believe what i've been missing out on seriously why had no one told me about this before my entire childhood was deprived of doctor who adventures me being a tremendous fan of most sci fi and fantasy adventures honestly i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes br br i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that billie piper would be the best actress but i'm happy to say that she did very well i thought and added a very realistic touch to the series i think actually that was one of my favourite aspects of the series the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the south london council estate life i'm always interested in instances where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives i also loved christopher eccleston i haven't seen many of his films and i've never seen another actor as dr who but i thought his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder i find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two dimensional they have all the right emotions and actions but they always seems slightly shallow this doctor on the other hand earned my loyalty with his stratified personality i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects aliens and whatnot might have been a bit more effective but then again this isn't about special effects though they help from what i've read and heard from long time dr who fans it's the spirit of the whole things that really counts and i don't think they did a bad job with what they had i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the daleks if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series it was that there were things in it that looked like dustbins on wheels previous to watching i was quite sceptical about these pepper pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary which i loved of course br br overall a good show i look forward to future episodes with delight the doctor has a new fan
<START> a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning br br i like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island subtract all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this br br the acting is i would say good there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish get's her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with manuel the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is away and he won't even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she doesen't get approval for her actions she's a victim br br i recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience
<START> this movie was outright painful for me to watch i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to first off jump cuts there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take and the rest of the line is from a different take secondly the dialog i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films since this film is very specific to its location the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also example set a movie in boston yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent even with understanding this it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film there were a few others i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing i have years of experience in the film more importantly the low budget indie film industry i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness i have been unable to discover this method used in this film this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making or just another low budget poorly put together film i honestly hope that it is not the latter if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way or has any thoughts views of their own concerning this film i would love to hear them hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed
