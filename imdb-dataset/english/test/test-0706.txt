<START> i'll start off right at the beginning by saying i like this movie it's sweeping it's grand it's gripping and it's fun the physician sits in front of his small stone hut writing his memoirs and what a story it is taken from a river and reared by an elderly couple who doted on him he becomes a physician to the poor he befriends who sees glory while sees healing and both run into the future pharaoh forgive my who endures an epileptic fit br br and this pharaoh has another flaw he believes in one god instead of a pantheon of gods back then this was totally revolutionary and grow up one night sees a woman who makes him lose his senses he gives up his practice sells his parents' home and even their tombs just to spend a night with her does he i won't tell meanwhile merit a tavern maid played with sweet simplicity belying strength by jean simmons falls in love with she falls under his spell and under the spell of the belief in one god br br victor mature overacts perfectly as edmond purdom is sincere as the lost physician does he find redemption stay tuned even bela the woman who steals heart isn't as bad as everyone has said the fact that she was daryl f zanuck's mistress had nothing to do with the casting right yeah right still she wasn't that bad i've seen worse i think she did better in the egyptian than many of today's young actresses have done in anything i said it before and i'll say it again i like this movie i recommend it it makes you think despite some hammy acting have fun with this movie it's worth it
<START> i've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it the less i like it jamie lynn spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is britney's sister and i'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious they've created the character zoey to be everything people want to believe jamie lynn is clever original smart pretty popular etc the characters around her are only there to make her look better by being smarter then them more popular than them more wanted by boys then them there is nothing original about this and it's poured with money so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff i also have to say for a 13 year old girl or however old she is can't be much older she wears very mature clothing those short skirts are too short it makes young people want to wear them and all that make up this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble the only thing i will say is that the opening credits are sung by jamie lynn and given her age isn't bad at all much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability sorry it's too mature and yet too dumbed down it's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too
<START> it's so fake the plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film the common themes of blaxploitation like racism oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined so simplistically shallowly and the jokes aren't even funny dolemite does these stand up monologue comedy routines that are really painful all the people around him deliver this canned laughter even the soundtrack sounds like it's the funk for far better comedy in a blaxploitation try coffy friday foster with pam grier for a more realistic experience try black heat
<START> channel zapping one night i just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning it tells the sad story of an adopted child adam whose mother left him after birth the movie takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from adam's past i will not reveal more but it is a very in depth movie and will intrigue you for sure this was one of jimmy best roles in my opinion
<START> i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two martin lawrence is a good comic actor and i reckoned he might be a good stand up comedian actor in the style of richard pryor br br i couldn't have been more wrong this concert was awful it was full of racist comments directed at white people muslims and people from india muslims and indians are the same thing in lawrence's narrow mind and rambling clichÃ©d cod philosophy lawrence like many black comics and directors can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform do we really need a lecture on martin luther king and the civil rights struggle during a stand up comedy show then there were his fawning comments designed to ingratiate him with women it made my skin crawl listening to him br br worst of all the show simply wasn't funny and i found it boring i turned over halfway through and flipped back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was self indulgent on his part to bore us with the details he clearly didn't have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show out br br this show was rubbish
<START> mom has to be one of the all time uncomfortable movies to watch it features an elderly lady you would love to have as your nanny who becomes the nastiest mother f ing monster you would ever want to meet on a dark night br br this supper nanny eats the inners of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets sicker as it goes on a cross between the howling and brain dead seem to come to mind when describing mom br br a must for horror fans who have the stomach for it if you have watched re animator or brain dead this will float your boat and are willing to switch the brain off for an hour or so let the gore pour 8 10
<START> i went to see this 3 nights ago here in cork ireland it was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the arts centre as part of the cork film festival br br i found strange fruit to be an excellent movie it is a bit rough around the edges but for a low budget movie that is to be expected in general the acting particularly from the main lead kent is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought provoking with some nice set ups and witty dialogue br br the ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for it certainly did make the movie more unsettling i did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real life sometimes these things are never settled this was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up br br taut and suspenseful throughout strange fruit is a hugely ambitious debut and i have high hopes for what the writer director kyle will unleash next he and his colleagues are a talent worth watching br br i hope strange fruit gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in america's deep south br br highly recommended 7 10
<START> so many times bollywood has tried to remake hollywood hits only to produce total duds mercifully yash chopra's interpretation of sleeping with the enemy is an extremely stylish and well made films br br shah rukh khan is obsessed with juhi chawla who's looking her very best in here when he realizes that juhi has a fiance in sunny deol he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his br br every frame of this film is a delight to watch whether it's shah rukh chanting his trademark i love you k k k kiran or the feel good mushy scenes between sunny and juhi who make a perfect match you won't feel like leaving your eat in boredom br br each and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing especially teri and tu mere like i said juhi looks like a goddess in this film darr may not be srk's best film that honor goes to but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances sunny is ok he's done similar roles before but he's good br br overall darr is g g g great
<START> well made documentary focusing on two refugees who get resettled in the united states it's your basic fish out of water story with a non fiction twist i found it fascinating to see how peter and lived prior to coming to america and how they adapted once they arrived here in houston texas they expected a sort of heaven but found out that it's a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states they go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted they fret that they are blacker than the african americans here and don't feel accepted because of that one of the lost boys manages to leave houston to go to olathe kansas where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal there are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film not shown but talked about are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them leading one lost boy to comment negatively that all black people in america are no good i found it interesting too that they arrived in houston in august 2001 a month before the world trade center was attacked by terrorists i had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it's not mentioned at all still all in all a really well done documentary with no narration none is needed really the lost boys do a fine job on the events going on around them without any help at all thank you very much
<START> mr bug goes to town was one of those films that i grew up hearing about however a copy could never be obtained until now i just watched this film on dvd and thought it was a delightful and charming film with wonderful animation a good plot and great songs if this film was made by disney then the film would be considered a classic however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone the film has slipped through the cracks br br the film was made by the max fleischer studios at their miami fl studios and was released through paramount pictures the film was to have had its premiere on dec 7th 1941 the date of the bombing of pearl harbor though this probably did hurt the release of the film the film did play at some movie theaters for up to a year as evidenced by doing some research the film was called a family favorite by most of the major american newspapers the film continued to be re released about every year or so usually around holidays like easter at least in major cities br br in the mid 1950s this film was re released under a new name goes to town named after the lead character in the film br br the film is a true period piece capturing a slice of americana as it was back in the late 30s and 1940's the animation is great and many of the characters are very cute the animation of the humans in the film is via the rotoscope process meaning that actors were filmed and then that footage was traced over by animators giving the movement a very real look br br the studios were one of several animation studios making animated cartoons back in the 30s and 40s while some of the fleischer characters like betty boop popeye and the superman cartoons are better known the work of the studio is more or less forgotten br br almost as a whole the body of work of the fleischer studios are in the public domain all of the superman cartoons are public domain all but one of the color classics series are public domain and the film gulliver's travels is also in the public domain this film never appears to have been released in the us on vhs or dvd but was released in europe however some looking around on the internet can very quickly produce you with a copy i recommend the search
<START> goofy story about a young man arquette who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr nicholas the film is written ridiculously direction is odd dialogues are out of place and scrambled the actors didn't do it much justice either arquette is annoying throughout ian nicholas was nonexistent macy was decent but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance he was at least tolerable this is a stupid film in my eyes boring at times not entertaining just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody imdb rating 5 5 my rating 4 10
<START> being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind but still this isn't a bad movie by any means it's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble what's wrong with that it doesn't have any big special effects but so what who needs special effects cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized a coincidence i think not it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big substance less light show for innocent kids and the self medicated well you know not all movies need special effects about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects think about it star wars e t ghostbusters etc all good movies but the rest of the top grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non sensical plots and lots of eye candy well some movies don't need ny of that junk br br excuse me for going off on a tangent which i normally do but i'm just so fed up with that special effects junk back to the point toy soldiers is simply a great movie i admit some of the content is a little corny and ripped off but so what every movie rips off another to some extent think of dogs countless appreciation sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino who i admit i like has copied many many many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr tarentino loved so much and probably still does sorry once again for the tangent br br toy soldiers is fun it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority i e hostage takers it's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do hell teenage angst inspired was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire arms and knock out the bad guys etc plus there's some emotional points to the film when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust it's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there br br in short toy soldiers is exciting interesting and fun how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly shame on you all br br personal rating 8 10
<START> one cannot help but admire mike judge for his hands on i've experienced that approach with office space almost anyone working a job could associate with the characters idiocracy has exactly the same feel to it one can easily appreciate the years later experience of our heroes because again the director has tried to put things on a very human level somewhat similar to woody allen's sleeper this movie is very funny do not miss the deleted scenes as the museum of fart is a classic imaginative comedy is a rarity and idiocracy is wildly imaginative extremely funny and a solid 8 0 movie experience merk
<START> when i was younger i saw the end of hair on tv i just watched the last 5 minutes of the film and i was really impressed by it i got goose pimples and i said to myself that i had to watch this film br br and i did and i've to say this film is amazing the songs are great the actors are very good and the message the message of this film is one of the most important ones make love no war this film is a real masterpiece meanwhile it's my favourite film br br the last song is one of the saddest and happiest i ever listened to i nearly could feel myself joining the crowd all i've got to say let the sun shine let the sun shine in
