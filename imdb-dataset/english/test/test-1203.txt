<START> spoiler warning i seem to keep giving this guy his last chance strange how an action hero who once was keeps attracting an audience anyway this movie is about a character seagal being kind of a mysterious rough neck hero that's it br br next
<START> one of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film to have it totally wash over you so that you absorb it as it is and thus experience it to the fullest every time i see it 'the is such a film over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities but perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics it is at once forbidding remote possibly dangerous beware of what lies within the haunting chords of the music seen over the 20th fox logo usher us into titles of other worldly turquoise lettering br br strange archaeological decadent it is as if we are descending into some vault of antiquity wherein might be great treasures mixed with uncertain hazards one might imagine darryl zanuck commanding 'make it ancient ' then what a darkly dramatic story unfolds all within the same tone set at the start br br of hollywood's mid 50s 'the ten portrayed the civilization's sternness the phenomenal 'land of the its nuts and bolts while 'the shows it all from glamour to tragedy for us to wonder at br br no need to say much about the players here but i think that with the passage of time bella is being redeemed what a perfect face for the role right out of a symbolist painting if her acting does not please some it might be argued that in her role as a she is obviously better in bed than yakking to some poor helpless admirer i think that curtiz captured the kinkiness of her sado masochistic relationship with edmund character with aplomb censorship being what it was at the time sir peter ustinov in his memoirs was pretty kind to 'the writing that it was 'like being lost in a huge set for his pronunciation of the word i have adopted myself ever after one of the film's historically accurate references the invented beer henry daniell what a perfect performance gene tierney what a screen treasure bless for giving her this role c'mon folks don't be so hard on victor mature he's a son who rose to be pharaoh sounds like a peculiarly american opportunity one of the best moments john carradine's existential observations on the sands of time and utterance about dwelling beyond the sunset of the world if that isn't grade 'a' what is br br of course along with everything else the music is sublime it is frequently noted that alfred newman and bernard herrmann created one of the screen's most compelling scores perfectly harmonious yet each theme is well developed with a life of its own newman pressed for time by called in herrmann someone he could trust implicitly to take up half the burden br br benny not the easiest guy to work with obviously respected newman enough to really deliver inspiring music they alternated cues an ingenious approach no spoilers as to who did what here but benny brings an edge with him mysterious awesome sounds alfred brings longing poignancy both are consummately epic even when seen on a squeezed tv print the effect of seeing the two composers' names side by side in the main credits which the ultra wide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate is spine tingling br br leon shamroy the dean of cinemascope does not let us down here the lurid greens and moody shadows probably distortions in all the terrible tv prints i've seen through the years perfectly accompany the multi dimensional script by the great philip dunne and wb vet casey robinson whom curtiz must've brought with him to 20th how remarkable it is that shamroy who was as much of an institution of cinematography at fox as newman was with music would lens a few years later but in the brighter sharper images of '60s todd a o these old studio guys are really heroes of mine br br to me who wants to fret about all the imperfections and criticism opportunities in a picture like this i'd rather yield entirely to its spell and dive off into its sea of lavishness to emerge after the inspiring climax of 'the end' refreshed moved and hungry for more br br and yes we should cry out to 20th fox for a dvd release worthy of legacy
<START> well the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was best screenplay and thought this would be a good rental wow was i mistaken i'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here but after the incredibly poor acting and video game production values this ends up looking like retarded half brother the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie five minutes into it you'll be asking yourself what the hell am i watching and it will just snowball from there an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob zombie's rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie on a side note 3 most romantic quote in a movie i think you're the final destination
<START> in the real world of art elizabeth is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do but no guy wants to wake up next to her on screen portrayer christina ricci is the ugly artsy wannabe girl that desperately wants every and any guy but no guy will touch her that's why in prozac nation the unreleased 2001 film of 1990s bestseller book of the same name there are immediate problems ok the problems start before the miscast of ricci who has the emotional range of a is it any wonder that by far her finest acting was in the two addams family films first off she is bizarre looking with big eyes and a bulging forehead making her look like the fetal from 2001 a space odyssey secondly she always plays whiney brats but thirdly is the way films try to make it appear any guy would be attracted to her in one scene in the film her pal ruby michelle williams and liz walk through harvard and all the guys' tongues are wagging at ricci not the super cute and sexy williams reality check timeÂ this material begged for the andy warhol treatment here is his version of the film a five minute shot of a hypodermic needle a five minute shot of hairy a five minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed she rises gives the middle finger to the audience cue credits see less than twenty minutes to distill whole life and oh yeah warhol's film would not have cast ricci even michelle williams would have been better and after seeing ricci's pallid bosom i'd take anything williams or any other babe had to offer me cinematically ricci is almost the kiss of death for a film and how she stays working is a mystery think of her performances in mediocre to bad films like monster sleepy hollow and woody allen's anything else also co starring jason biggs and now picture another actress in her role and immediately the films could seem better if not great she is the female counterpart to banal wooden milquetoast actors like tom cruise and leonardo dicaprio
<START> ron howard and his editors only had one job to do follow the guidelines of the book which was rich mysterious moving and highly cinematic in its approach br br what they did they changed everything and i mean everything what is left is something that has no right being called angels br br i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way br br i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for this film br br i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1 000 000 changes they made it is pointless
<START> simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often skipped over in feel good movies i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again br br as a child it sparked my interest purely for the building of a plane as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world br br the portrayal of the king was great the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human which may not be far from reality it makes for interesting developments br br worth a watch any day
<START> before last call w carson daly my local nbc affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w conan such as second city tv 3rd rock from the sun in the city reruns and some stand up comedy these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson daly and his awful show he is not a comedian he is not an actor he does not deserve to be famous because he isn't a good speaker nor comedian br br on his june 21st show he tried to use an internet called the on his show he failed hard that event confirms that carson daly is awful
<START> oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time the best word to describe it is genius the writing the acting the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing br br i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right away and i was really surprised that it hasn't gotten the recognition it truly deserves it is violent and most of the characters aren't meant for you to like them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look past the violence and the criminals and see them as real people they are the lowest forms of scum but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their stories br br the violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible but the show isn't about the violence like some people might believe it really is a work of art and i'm sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do
<START> i remember watching an elizabeth montgomery movie when i was maybe 5 years old if that and to this day i can remember this movie in just bits and pieces it was the movie i remembered all throughout my life because i was sooo scared i think i remember the story part of it and the house constantly being dark the main part that was the most freaky to me was elizabeth walking around the house all dark and then there was someone in the field outside at the time i thought i was an old witch but the memory of it is now way hazy so i can't really remember who it was but it was someone definitely in a field outside lurking and that part is what freaked me out the most i really wish i could see this movie again if anyone knows how to get a copy please email me at yahoo com
<START> i know curiosity killed the cat but i simply had to see the remake of psycho especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work i've watched the original psycho though since i was a kid i knew how to respect it and not only that it was an excellent movie one of the best in fact the first thing i said when i heard about the remake was how do you remake perfection i stuck to that as well but i think i have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psycho to a new generation br br but this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho i know this has been said but i watched the making of this film and the director was like oh i just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original what's the friggin' point ok but i want to judge this movie on it's own despite it's insulting blows the original i mean the acting wasn't up to par but honestly it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own br br watching the making of this film i wanted to slap anne she said i've never seen the original i just wanted to work with gus ooh that made me angry because frankly it's not just that she really sucked in this role as marian she wasn't convincing not to mention her shower scene really was horrible vince vaughn didn't make let's just put it this way the film was horribly miscasted this was a sin against film and on it's own this was actually a bad movie it was too much and destroyed what could've been a new introduction for a new generation but to gus leave the film making the one's who know what they're doing br br 1 10
<START> strange often effective hippie zombie flick starring the unforgettable husband wife team of alan and anya this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre but is still way high on the cheese factor includes several bargain basement zombies outrageously campy dialogue a scene chewing performance by alan several gay kinky grave robbers and one soundtrack wife anya puts on a performance that's so odd one has to wonder if she's really acting at all there are much worst pics of this kind during the era look for any al adamson flic but it's no night of the living dead director writer benjamin clark is really bob clark who went on to create the purile porky's early 80's teen exploitation disasters he has only now resurfaced after 1 inexplicably good movie a christmas story to return to his dreadful ways with baby geniuses weirdo alan later wrote the kinky kinski malcolm mcdowell version of cat people moocow says check this hippy horror movie out for fun zombie frolics and campy dialogue 8
<START> everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time the acting writing cinematography music visuals everything was top notch as an avid fan of the genre both lesbian films and gymnastics i was so unbelievably pleased by this film it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board hearing the q a with the cast and crew was great the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important and the writer did a hell of a job as well as directing and the editing was awesome thanks so much for making a great film thanks also for the line about 'if you're going to slap a label on yourself it would be i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight it's wonderful to see getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community and it was nice that labels weren't even necessary at all in this film what an ending just when i thought it couldn't give me more it did beautiful work and my applauds to all i will spread the word this is definitely a film not to be missed
<START> drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder's dialogue in the car and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead 8 10
<START> embarassing is the only word to describe this laughingly awful production from the blatant disregard of the source material sure to infuriate anyone remotely familiar with mythology to the predictably insufficient production value this entire mini series is a train wreck br br the cast which includes some good actors whom i pity delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic european accent so common to bad epics worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects from costume and set design blurring together styles from across time and space to the score which seems to poorly mimic many recognizable classical tunes as well as lord of the rings most offensive of all are the visual effects which single handedly prove that if you can't afford to do them well write them out br br it pained me to see yet another legendary tale bastardized by a cheap adaptation maybe one day someone will do it right
<START> house of the dead 2 dead aim 2005 is the sequel though you really don't need to see the first house of the dead to get this film that said the production value is definitely here with great zombie effects and it's edited quite nicely with very effective sound design however that said that's about all that's good here br br the story and script are awful there's blatant plot holes everywhere it's also funny how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you also realistic how there's little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military discipline br br a 4 out of 10
