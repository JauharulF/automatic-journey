<START> i'd honestly give this movie a solid 7 5 but i clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic unjustified 1 star reviews this is an interesting story all of the acting is good to very good even ms diaz who is totally out of her usual grinning bimbo role here yet plays it well the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy it's a fine morality play and there is no reason to explain the origin of the god supernatural being alien whatever that's running the show so i'm glad the movie doesn't try it's really irrelevant to the story which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending br br before you decide this movie is terrible or really anything under a 7 5 read some of the dozens of 1 star hated it reviews that are rife with misspellings lack of punctuation and and juvenile criticisms maybe the trailer was misleading or something i didn't see it but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator 4 or saw 5 one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw how utterly inappropriate and unrelated br br seriously most of these reviews read like you tube comments according to these critics this movie is too confusing yet too predictable not enough action yet there's too much going on too smart yet too dumb explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained oh and it's apparently a waist sic of time do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart i'm afraid these 1 star kids failed to understand the phrase altruism and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie's premise despite adamantly claiming that they get it right before explaining how confusing it was if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding and enjoying this movie br br i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie 1 star forever br br see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral test and facing the consequences it's a good time in my opinion
<START> i really enjoyed this movie and i usually don't like animated pictures but i thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming there is a good song called everybody wants to be a cat that is a lot of fun it has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure i think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film
<START> i am not a big music video fan i think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song any song in other words creative thinking goes out the window likewise personal feelings aside about mj toss aside this was the best music video of alltime simply wonderful it was a movie yes folks it was brilliant you had awesome acting awesome choreography and awesome singing this was spectacular simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man but was he a man or something sinister vincent price did his thing adding to the song and video mj was mj enough said about that this song was to video what are for cars top of the line what was even better about this was that we got the real mj without the thousand though ironically enough there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around folks go to youtube take 14 mins out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is
<START> the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction the other two were monkey on my back and a of rain but i think of the three this one is the best br br maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet who knows maybe preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location it's the only flaw i find in the film br br frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss robert strauss when the game was raided he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer but a whole lot of people are conspiring against him br br first bob strauss who wants him back dealing especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town he uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra's services back secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again and finally eleanor parker his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all just to keep him around br br frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film but lost to ernest borgnine in marty sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year his scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak's apartment will leave you shaken br br eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role she's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody she might have been nominated for this 1955 marked the high point of her career br br darren mcgavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl br br elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in not a place you'd want to bring up your family
<START> my partner and i had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot picking the title from a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it as it opened and revealed the cast we thought well how bad can it be kathy bates jonathan pryce rupert everett lynn redgrave dan akroyd and more as the story unfolded we became more and more tickled with our selection and the film soon had us laughing out loud throughout this is not a great film but it is one of those rare films that has such a great combination of memorable characters taken through truth is stranger than fiction type surreal events that i couldn't help but love it i had no problem suspending my disbelief at some of the wackier story elements because the intentions of the filmmakers are so warm hearted while they still manage to poke fun at everyone involved as others on imdb said this is a comfort movie and i too wouldn't be surprised if it became a cult classic
<START> warning plot spoiler br br the always abnormal movies of david cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste fans of his earlier films will probably like but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish all of the usual elements are here a game pod made out of skin hooked into your back buckets of blood a gun made out of bones and a manic mechanic to name but a few the result is good in parts bad in parts and just plain weird in others but one thing the film has is undeniable originality br br despite the excessive use ofÂ weirdness it does prove a point virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people in the movie a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was annoying' assuming that she was still in the game but it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life like game leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways br br despite some extra gadgets and gook it was simply your classic it was all a dreamÂ or was it' twist it is a smart surprise and answers a few questions but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing at only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too in a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way br br jennifer jason leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while but her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character jude law on the other hand equipped with a curious american accent is good as your average joe sucked into this abnormal world we see the film through his perspective br br is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember there's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of david lynch what next being consumed by a question mark it definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend my imdb rating 6 2 10
<START> i must say when i saw this film at a 6 5 on this site i figured it was well worth a view i was sorely disappointed from nearly the opening scene it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are in fact the killers could they have made it any more obvious if that is the intended twist in this film that's pretty sad while pullman and ormond are excellent actors even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer and that's the problem there is no switch from i'm playing fbi guy to i just killed 12 people and boy are my arms tired you can't blame the actors the story fails in far more ways than one br br from the onset of the film however i was certain i was wrong that no director writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot twist ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers i thought which gave the film's makers far too much credit i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15 minute mark br br to lynch's credit she did manage to interject many things that make a good film sex violence humor and well trained actors too bad they were in the wrong configuration hopefully james can recover from this role i found her performance particularly impressive as the stunning drug addict turned would be savior she should have rewritten the role so the crack whore would win br br those people who have compared this film to natural born killers take note tarantino made the characters of mickey and mallory reprehensible yet sympathetic the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore and this is not seen once in surveillance surveillance only wishes it were natural born killers in fact it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was folks who haven't seen surveillance stick to something with a little more intelligence like camp rock
<START> the journey is a very good film produced in the spring of 1958 in vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years despite the political problems which influenced the movie's success because the story happens during the hungarian revolution the cold war the journey is a very good film but not well known i think it should be released immediately on dvd because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home one of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between deborah kerr and yul brynner their intense relationship all their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters major and diana another quality is the script which is very well written it was even published as a novel by the screen player george tabori the film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end at first we didn't know if diana and the other travelers could leave hungary because the communist major discovers that diana's friend paul is hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country the major falls deeply in love with diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go but after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go and the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed the major and diana say goodbye she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including paul while is shot several times by some hungarians so he dies yul brynner is very very handsome and deborah kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an english lady yul and deborah are perfect together they are one of the greatest couples of the golden hollywood a true moviegoer should watch this film the journey has everything that a good film should have a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction anatole litvak is in my opinion at his best finally i want to give a message to warner bros studios or those who restore and release classic films please release the journey on dvd as soon as possible
<START> i'd heard about this movie but didn't see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to australia told me it was a great movie i was interested in seeing whether rupert away from harry potter was showing the promise you see in the potter movies i wasn't disappointed he's become a fine actor showing a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over bearing obsessive mother to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own and other's esteem going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging actress employer it's obvious that he's ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage but the jewel of this movie was julie walters i'd seen her previously in the potter movies billy elliott and calendar girls and loved her in driving lessons as she does lines from poetry and shakespeare i was awed by her timing command of the language and body language i'm hoping it was make up costuming as she portrays an older woman with though no mention of it is made in the movie as a nurse i can say that she did this perfectly portraying a woman on the brink of old age but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in this is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time and i wish i'd seen it in a theatre first but i doubt it ever played anywhere here in albuquerque we miss out on so many of these types of movies here
<START> it's hard to make a bad movie with the underdog finally succeeds sport theme but this movie succeeds admirably my mind boggles at how pointless and boring this film is br br i guess the director couldn't decide whether this was about the runner or the coach it ends up being about neither ultimately who cares neither character has a likable personality there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone even the bad guy isn't really bad i think he's in two scenes and seemingly is on some kind of i think he asks her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him then later he kinda' asks her to move in with him that's it conflict tension what will she do br br and what's with the depiction of running has the director ever seen an actual marathon christine's form is so incorrect it's absurd as is the form of the supposed champion she competes with a character with no lines maybe they could have hired you know an actual runner br br and the speed the run at is beyond comprehension were they running or speed walking it's actually laughable i can literally walk backwards faster then they were running in the big race maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speed br br another absurdity spoiler i guess at one point in the big race the two women in the lead inexplicably fall at the same time what they fell on is a mystery maybe they both just got exhausted and fell down and then they get up but don't start running again for maybe 30 seconds oh yeah very realistic this ridiculous event doesn't even add any tension since the other runners are not close and besides at this point you have been numbed into a state of catatonia br br i especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates highly trained athletes all drop out of the big race due to charlie horses or pulled tendons or something just as improbable br br but who cares this movie has almost no tension no resolution nothing some woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old boring coach with some past failure that is barely hinted at they train a lot she is not happy they train some more she wins da big race woopie br br my description is actually more interesting than the actual movie i just saved you 90 minutes avoid this one like the plague
<START> walking with dinosaurs is absolutely brilliant in every regard kenneth branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen the script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go the music is also brilliant very dramatic when it needs to be but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well the scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real thanks to the simply astounding effects this is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too br br in conclusion this is a must watch not only did i love this but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen if anything it could have done with being longer other than that this is perfect 10 10 bethany cox
<START> first of all let me make it clear this movie is a real piece of garbage but although it is a real piece of garbage it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been it could have sucked big time but it doesn't br br what this movie didn't have was for example scary moments good acting and a good script it wasn't very entertaining either but the movie had cool music fancy locations and hot girls it also works great as a dracula spoof hope it was meant that way although i really don't think so br br the story focuses on three girls in transylvania awaking an ancient vampire which then terrorizes and kills the girls one by one sounds familiar yes so it does br br after reading through this you may think that i should have given it a better vote the reason i don't is because i almost felt asleep at some points
<START> what a boring movie while it did have humorous parts it was just plain boring and lengthy for a 90 minute movie i believe that the cause was a lack of action br br when i rented this movie i expected to see white blood cells combat the evil viruses but no such luck it was more that the virus was thwarted than defeated br br the movie had promise but since made for little kiddies in mind it did not meet its potential in my opinion
<START> i saw this one remastered on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so she's barely in it she does what she can with the script but that's not much br br the sound was awful by that i mean things didn't go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't correspond to the sound people talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there's no motor noise road noise or any other sound kind of weird br br score was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful br br acting was awful i couldn't believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the biff and bam they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with firearms were laughable literally i fast forwarded through a lot of this movie even then it was too long
<START> i stumbled upon this movie by chance i was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night not much else on and figured i watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until i decided to go to bed needless to say i stayed up and watched the complete movie the plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been ss who did this or at least thought of doing it i have been looking all over for this movie i even sent and email to the production company but the weren't sure that it would ever make it to dvd but said there was always hope if anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it as i'd sure like to get a copy some day
