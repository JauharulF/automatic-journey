<START> this is a great valentine's day gift a gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition at a baking contest very romantic i'm a real fan of costas mandylor since his days at picket fences and he hasn't lost his appeal lauren holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together the supporting cast was good as well seeing all those wonderful desserts being made was a delicious sight in itself i loved that costas and lauren teamed up to win in the baking competition and in love this is the kind of film that all palates romantic and otherwise hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception the whole family can view this film also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity i found myself sighing and wishing for more for this film and also yearning for those wonderful desserts i recommend this film highly for all ages a great treat for all
<START> this movie has to be the worst film i have seen there is a reason it was made to be a mow movie of the week the continuity was all wrong palm trees in a chicago setting even though it was filmed in toronto canada the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004 hello lord of the rings had better cgi than that but i guess they also had the money for it the budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this mow more than a 2 needs to go back to film and tv school next time remember that care and time make a classic not rushing for a tornado box office or tv smash hit br br also i know networks can reuse footage from old networks or but using 80's footage for 2004 i have a hard time buying that
<START> film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat wasn't made haphazardly you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i was br br for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from wayne's world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like elf and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices
<START> i play this game exactly after i watch the trailer in old magazine advertise cd br br the is very interesting and dark atmospheric missing in nowadays games movies the game is set somewhere in the middle of the '90 in the spooky mysterious mansion you play as adam randell and your quest is to free the soul of your death trapped father br br the look of the game is doom like but very different type of game a lot of a action various puzzles quests mazes and many more interesting locations and characters are presented in this old classic game br br the game will run only on windows 98 and there is no patch for windows xp
<START> a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isn't called snake island because it's just soooooo much fun to say it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain't anything couldn't see in a pg13 rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out but don't torture yourself with this crap
<START> grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller the acting is very normal the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very and that really annoyed me the whole reunion and the 'wow i haven't seen you in 10 years ' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them it just all seemed very tacky pointless and was poorly executed br br dan akroyd's role as a assassin is very sparse he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a 'final show down' which is hugely hyped up but doesn't deliver at all br br the soundtrack is also very mediocre the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980's and with the exception of two or three are very bad hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this film br br i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department the way that half the time you forget that cusak's character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non existent br br even the way the comedy thinks it's funny but it isn't i didn't laugh once during this movie sure maybe i smirked now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly over br br please don't waste your time with 'grosse pointe blank' despite the relatively high but badly incorrect imdb rating i've seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there just don't bother with this one
<START> i just saw this film last night and i have to say that i loved every minute if taken in the spirit of a parody of bond esquire films it's truly superior the true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness the misogyny cultural insensitivity and almost laughable macho ism of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect it also calls the illogic and formulaic elements to task with agent oss 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely quick such as arabic and how to play a traditional instrument while missing some pathetically obvious clues some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished and i have to say i have learned some interesting french vocabulary that would probably have my professors quite exasperated with me were i to use all in all i thought this film excellent intensely funny and the first film i've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film
<START> this film took me by surprise i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7 8 rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7 9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8 2 if anything they underrated this little gem br br filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother mina and less than forthcoming dad mike i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker mike son doug was going to take us as a matter of fact i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this br br life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten 51 birch street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work bravo
<START> this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen br br i can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a sf one br br for example br br 1 it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold and after 10 hours to get up so quickly br br 2 you can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie believe me it's my domain br br 3 with a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron br br 4 if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint in the best case it's more likely to die because your hart fails before to get to the bone shin br br and there are more other examples
<START> this is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever i really cannot believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors mute witness has all the style suspense and plot twists of a hitchcock depalma movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn and hot dog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is br br the plot centres on billie hughes a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory by a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie br br one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made as the main character is mute she cannot make a noise something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie and a curse in others br br the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well even the opening scene is a tongue in cheek nod to both hitchcock's psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes br br while the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end br br all in all a hugely overlooked well paced and action packed psycho thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy jason scream michael myers damien at
<START> seth mcfarlane is a true genius he has crafted a show that is witty culturally sharp and just downright hilarious br br for those that think its 'offensive' take on social or cultural topics makes no meaningful comment just causes can be pointed to this quote br br peter coming out of the stem cell lab how long was i in there guard five minutes peter why aren't we funding this br br why indeed br br thanks family guy for being not only the funniest show on tv with the possible exception of the much loved much missed futurama but for also being pretty clever to boot
<START> although i do not recommend this film neither do i recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie though i have not given away the ending or most of the plot twists this movie would be best viewed without any prior information it's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film donnie darko as there are many to deal with richard kelly in his first feature film seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage late night stoner diatribes self righteous justifications and inoffensive banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen angst dramas then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci fi twist the result is deeply distressing for all the wrong reasons the film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning to make them sympathize with one dimensional characters and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot full of loose ends by hiding it under a veneer of cgi effects and neo surrealism the main character donnie darko is a young man committed to therapy misunderstood by his friends and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life we are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make for example when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the smurfs and donnie counters with a theory of his own his friend complains about donnie acting all smart speech however is no smarter than that of his friend just angrier the only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as intimidating ' but given the director's slant against simple of human elements as shown in the fear love sequence this is a poor substitute for character development donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems which are not addressed directly in this film in fact the entire issue of the drugs is understated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost the ambiguity of strange destiny the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination is pushed into the background making the film 100 percent science fiction this would not be a bad thing in itself except that the science behind the fiction is very shaky the explanations of time travel are weak at best sounding like detached uninformed rambling we get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters and can't quite remember how it worked but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film the scientific portion as a result depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved at one point a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject he'd be fired apparently no further explanation is needed dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions the justification for these actions is a tricky business he damages his school but it's okay because his school doesn't treat him like a person his punishment of a creepy self esteem advocate somewhat similar to tom cruise's character in magnolia results in the man's public humiliation but should the audience believe that donnie is some sort of avenging angel striking out against ignorance and debauchery he himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact aside from these flaws the film is riddled with flat uninteresting generalizations of humanity the story is set in 1988 just before the bush dukakis election and the director touches on this point during the film the focus however extends exactly this far gruff blue collar father is voting for bush while his free spirited rebellious daughter plans to vote for dukakis there is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here simply a statement of the obvious the former are not necessary to make a good film but the latter should be left out likewise heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of fear and love this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless mr kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film e t stephen king the smurfs back to the future at it's heart this film feels like the director's homage to himself a collection of his own experiences interests personal heroes and adversaries affirmations and roughly stitched together by untrained hands entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions seemingly because the director likes the songs characters who have little to no bearing on the plot including the archetypal bully fat girl and right wing idiot teacher are given unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow the awkward mess that is donnie darko leaves us wondering if mr kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless cluttered meandering effort br br my rating 1 10
<START> this cheapo remake of the terrific five star final suffers from terrible acting humphrey bogart stars as the manager of a radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings the owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago so they hire the fake preacher harry hayden to track down the murderess who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name the preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives br br bogart is always good hayden is good the the slimy preacher and henry o'neill is good as the father everyone else is just awful helen wins no sympathy crucial for the role linda perry is a lousy actress beverly roberts is ok but always looks old claire dodd and hobart cavanagh have no parts carlyle moore is a dud as the boy friend virginia is miscast as the society mother robert overacts as the station owner br br this one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which boasted dynamic performances by edward g robinson aline macmahon frances starr and boris karloff but it's always worth watching
