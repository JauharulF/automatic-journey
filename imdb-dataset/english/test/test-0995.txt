<START> everything about this show is terrible its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing a family theme has already been used too many times most notably by the simpsons which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs meanwhile family guy has about five minutes of story in each episode with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in now if this was original or funny sure i'd think it was clever but no it's not funny at all in fact the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk much of this show is unoriginal and what is original is just lame it is also amazingly crude and irreverent which again can be fine if it's still intelligent animation isn't everything either but from an artistic point of view this show fails also proving yet again that family guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible people enjoy this show and i don't really care because people can enjoy anything they want no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator but no i don't recommend this especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer this is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this the fact that this is so successful says bad things about america

<START> for unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well deserved recognition and has been vastly under appreciated by many american movie critics so it's easy to understand that i've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie finally i watched it and it was so beautiful sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life i watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape the story is focused on the friendship between two young boys erik and dexter eleven and twelve years old who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best and only friends the beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before there are so many beautiful heartfelt and poignant scenes particularly on the river which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them the movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism particularly strong with erik's shoe which also greatly increases visual impression from such beautiful work the story written by robert is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern hollywood's products practically every scene every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them peter horton who as i know had no major experience in movie directing before showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere the cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie but the most important is perfect acting which with all above mentioned makes the cure one of the best movies ever both brad as erik and joseph as dexter created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters only one this movie i haven't seen most of their other works is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation annabelle sciorra also give a terrific performance as dexter's mother it's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by david and terrific mark cohn's song one of the best songs that i've ever heard in the movies my great escape so all that i can say about the cure is one simple word Â great at any point of view this movie is a beautiful heartfelt and inspiring work of all people involved in making of this masterpiece i have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and universal pictures which among numerous formulaic commercial projects has found a way to make such a beautiful movie but such movie so rarely come to movie theaters that very often studios themselves don't realize what gem they have made that they're unable to provide respective marketing campaign the only one minor drawback about the cure for me is its short length only 97 minutes br br i don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words so if you have any opportunity for watching the cure rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed br br 10 out of 10 sorry for my bad english
<START> i have been living in istanbul for 24 years and i a 39 years of experience would suggest do know what istanbul has gone through all those years br br faith akin is still quite young born in 1973 and falling in the great mistake of being orientalist when looking at turkey just as his other movie gegen die wand did this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and misleads the audience when giving out quite false clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of istanbul br br anyone who could speak turkish could easily attest that many underground bands groups depicted in the movie for one are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as of the contemporary turkish music much less a piece of crap which many turkish listeners even do not know about at all br br we turks have long been accustomed to westerners who look at turkey with some orientalist point of view trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind molds what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish originated director faith akin is making the same mistake looking at turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better all of a vain effort br br just ask any turkish friend of yours what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names manco ibrahim and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today br br faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people's minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music
<START> john wayne is one of the few players in film history to have failed at his first big break and then succeed on the second time around of course everyone knows the second time was the classic stagecoach with john ford directing br br but we're here to talk about the big trail john ford's fellow director raoul walsh spotted this tall kid on the set of one of ford's films and thought he had potential he wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that fox was planning to do the film as planned would be an homage to the famous classic silent western the covered wagon br br in watching the big trail i was struck by how similar wayne's character of breck coleman here is to the ringo kid in stagecoach both characters were likable young but both were also on a mission of vengeance and of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them no studio product here with a backlot western set br br i also don't think that it was an accident that wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era raoul walsh i'm guessing looked around hollywood and probably didn't think a whole lot of movie cowboys would have staying power in sound that's something else walsh spotted in wayne br br according to what i've read the big trail flopped because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process some genius at fox realized that their theaters weren't equipped with the wide screen to show it and when the great depression hit there would be no money to widen those screens at fox movie houses so the big trail got a limited release even in what we would call a formatted version and lost money big for fox films br br marguerite churchill is fine as the heroine who duke wins loses and wins again from ian keith keith charles stevens and f tyrone power are the trio of villains wayne has to deal with br br f tyrone power is the father of the famous movie legend tyrone power he was a big burly man with a grand background in classic roles on screen and on stage i wouldn't be surprised if his son who would have been 15 at the time might not have been hanging around the set br br also look for ward bond though you might have trouble spotting him under a big bushy beard br br watching the big trail now it is interesting to speculate where john wayne's career might have gone if the big trail had been a big hit
<START> i'm certain that people from usa don't know anything about the rest of the world but i think they mustn't talk about what they don't know and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations in france for instance the age of consent is 15 in brazil it's 14 in spain it's 12 so the teenagers actors 16 and 17 years old by the time of production aren't doing anything illegal nudity isn't considered big deal in almost all civilized countries and only a freak could consider a teenagers' love as child molestation
<START> i heard about this series in 2001 which a friend of mine was recording off the television each week i never bothered to watch though i became acquainted with the series through the magazine which i looked at every now and then in bookstores i recently purchased series one on dvd and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series the characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force as they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them bearing in mind that this is only a tv series and they are fictional br br however it isn't the pc world of star trek and so whilst every character shows a good trait they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with story lines mixed in with an overall multiple story arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences i have ever had the pleasure of viewing i absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another br br this strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut john crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy strange alien creatures different cultures being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades we can easily relate to what he must be feeling as he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate strong willed and brave character is a joy to watch br br i have watched only seven episodes of farscape season one and look forward to continuing through seasons two four and the mini series maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch buy and enjoy 10 10
<START> this movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time the dialog is crisp the pace is fast not only is this a clever comedy this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business br br there are so many funny lines a couple of my favorites br br ernie merriman sarcastically it must be nice to always believe you know better to always think you're the smartest person in the room jane seriously no it's not it's awful br br aaron he must be good looking jane how do you know that aaron no one invites a bad looking idiot to their room br br the performances of holly hunter albert brooks and william hurt were absolutely brilliant even years later i remember this movie well often forgotten is the wonderfully funny joan cusack i love the scene where the personnel are racing to beat a deadline there are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite i highly recommend this film
<START> on paper this movie has some chops a street kid overcoming past trauma rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off great stuff everyone loves a happy ending br br in the theater though there were some omissions that left the movie dead inside the dialog was hollow and uninteresting the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity and why did everyone need to be gay i have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it's used in this fashion not only is is offensive to homosexuals it trivializes the lifestyle and cheapens the movie if the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut br br every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form each had one major flaw and one minor flaw every character is good hearted were they succeed or not and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone br br the most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name pip comes from great expectations they give it to you once and that should be enough the story shares enough with the dickens classic to make this fact obvious br br the most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for pip and how pip the main character learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape in the end with lessons learned pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life
<START> the 80s were overrun by all those halloween friday the 13th slasher style horror movies so this is something of a relief br br ten unbelievably annoying teenagers would you want to hang out with these jerks decide to throw a halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called hull house during a past life sÃ©ance a demon is accidentally released and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others br br this all sounds very evil dead demons ish but tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings there are some good one liners the music is excellent the steve johnson prosthetic make up fx are scary and linnea quigley is quite fun as a boy crazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick br br great fun on a no brainer level after checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews i don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 br br i give it 8 out of 10
<START> ghillie a remake of the telugu is thankfully a clarified version of the original it packs the same punch and true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache a flagging career with the entry of the likes of surya and on the fray got the much needed uplift with this movie this might well prove to be the best movie vijay has ever been on considering the choices he has been making since then the hard working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new being accepted both by the industry and public alike br br the tightly snug script which runs at a neck break speed revolves around a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of a popular game among boys in india the events following the chance encounter with his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the and end of the movie vijay fits as a 't' into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door br br has more than a stereotyped tamil heroine mantle to play the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble with limited exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming of age to become a professional actress became my personal favorite after this movie br br the movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including change in decision to leave the country prakash raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter weight for role his almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero's armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing br br overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing i give it a clear 8 out of 10
