<START> although i totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of toni as di i would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting the young director paolo had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of darren requiem for a dream they both used the same mtv style filming combined with modern alternative techno music making the film Â le stand apart from the other crime mafia movies in its genre even though the movie may start of very slow paced almost sec compared to the faster hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its serenity marvellous character portray and splendid ending definitely a must see for people who enjoy the european italian cinema ps toni keep on acting like this we need an encore
<START> i blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and i dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob absolutely heart wrenching stuff yet uplifting at it's core br br a great effort on the part of ann margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who knowing her arthritic steel working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone arranges the of her children before she shuffles off the role really deserved an oscar br br you truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system br br if you haven't seen it get it if you can
<START> ladies and gentlemen allow us to introduce to you Â the this ancient latin american tribe even preceding the aztecs supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one hundred and seven year old lawman with a whip but before you get to see this however you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any actual sleaze in case i haven't made myself entirely clear yet the dark power is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor writer director phil intentions were obviously admirable but he Â as well as the rest of the cast crew Â lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half decent carefully watched the evil dead and other similar demonic themed movies and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house barely speaking out his last word above a whisper Â his grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks including a typically 80's aerobics babe a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a hermit as he was actually the guardian of an ancient burial ground sorcerers buried themselves alive only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living and honestly is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos as hinted at before already the first half of the dark power is terribly lame and sleep inducing the clichÃ©d pranks the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of lash larue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever then the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the sorcerers emerge from the ground instead of menacing they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning when a guy's lips are stretched out over his entire skull but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless like when a 9 year old kid named cletus goes joyriding with his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked chick beer in the bathtub after working out seriously unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing i'd advise to skip this film
<START> just a few words it's a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he were dead he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political and the saddest thing of all is that i actually agree with these people's sentiments yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave to vote oh and one of them finishes off the doctor from startrek voyager that's about as scary as it will get people if you are looking for a horror movie i suggest you keep on looking and if you are looking for a witty political satire you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called masters of horror but don't let me hold you back maybe you see something i've missed though chances are you'll be wasting your time with it just as i have let's just say i prefer my zombie movies with the zombies standing in of the camera
<START> i tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program gilmore girls it baffled me for i just couldn't put my finger on what this was about was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non rebellious daughter what the heck is this show about finally i just didn't care the cast makes me want to scream the writing is neither smart or intelligent it's syrupy and tedious br br so why did i watch because i heard so many good things about this and i am not one to voice an opinion until i have watched knee jerk reactions are usually wrong so i watched a few times the first time i watched this i saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40 maybe that is what didn't attract me i never liked any of the freaky friday films not to say this is like that but there are some similarities br br also i have a friend who watches this show every week so i asked her what is this show about a very bright young lady usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer so i asked others who rave about it they really don't know either br br gilmore girls is turning out to be a tv program that's like an art house movie many of us wont get it but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one just to be hip yes i find lauren graham's annoying whine whine nasally whine a whole hour of that wow and the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich the town is hokey the men are wimps the grand parents are boring and sadly i find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do it's like watching paint dry on the wall
<START> the beguiled is one of those under seen films in the careers of a director or actor that ends up playing better than expected in the same year that clint eastwood and don siegel collaborated on dirty harry they also worked together on this little psycho sexual drama set in civil war era confederacy country it's almost a 180 from what 'harry' had for audiences here is a film that is under the radar and with a low budget to almost no business when compared with what dirty harry pulled in it is also a story where eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men but women who despite their first appearances have darker sides to them and there's even romance in it in between some of the rougher and more complex scenes but in this kind of framework to make the film siegel therefore actually has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the picture that roams into something more european i'm reminded here and there of polanski's work in the 60's it all works though pretty well even with the initial doubt that these two figures of masculine film making eastwood the obvious and siegel having made his niche in b noir and low budget thrillers can pull off material that could possibly be made for a lifetime movie br br it was also captivating and really darkly comic here and there to see eastwood's performance working off of these girls he's doing something a little subversive in his performance by still having the sort of eastwood machismo if there is such a thing close to his clichÃ©d movie image by being a step ahead of this little school for young women at times and not at others to see eastwood in a performance like this as with play misty for me the other eastwood work of 1971 shows how cool he can act believably with very good actresses particularly here are the four main female characters each of varying ages and each with varying attractions to their man while siegel's work directing all of the actors has its moments in the first half it's really once the story crosses the half way mark in the dream sequence less successful than the director could be capable of that the real juicy scenes start to pick up a lot of this is the best that siegel directed dramatically pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where not expected br br it's a difficult film all of this praise aside as it doesn't paint anyone as being too respectable only the character of hallie the slave on duty played by mae mercer is sort of separated from what transpires between the all too curious women and along with this here is acting in a role that is and isn't what he's usually seen as during this time of his true formative years in the movies he's an anti hero here which was his trademark of the westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time but unlike those films he's not really in a mode where he's than life' to put it in a way as he is both deserter and womanizer deceiver and tricky even in his most charming and affable moments if it's not one of his best acting jobs which is hard to really put together considering his catalog it is one that is worth a look for fans who might want to see another side of him it's a credit to him but also to what clicked with his collaborations with siegel as they both took chances at this time in hollywood
<START> i only gave this film a 4 because i saw it in 3 d if you don't see it in 3 d i give it a 2 this movie is so bad it's not funny anyone can make a film like this for a weeks pay bad acting effects and story but it was cool to watch in 3d why can't they make good movies in the 3 d format
<START> i was very impressed with with this film which was directed by luigi the story was about a young woman translator who suddenly has lost all memory of the last three days and has suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon she can not explained how this has happened to anyone one day a postcard arrives for her from the island of where she goes to visit strangely though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her br br i thought that this was a very strange italian movie that seemed very haunting at times and there was also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the the time you were watching the film i would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is highly recommended
<START> am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else this film was terrible i'm a fan of all 3 series of the league of and have always respected the originality of the writers even when the format changed in series 3 this film however was a blatant half effort the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero there was about 5 moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end this would have been better as a 10 minute short on the dvd it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first 30 minutes br br if your a true fan of the league of gentlemens ability to stay fresh then you'll hate this film if you only watch it cause there was nothing better on tv then u'll love it br br someone back me up
<START> br br i first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 i dismissed it offhand saying that julie was no daniel never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid br br but here it is 5 years later its on disney and im watching it again and i'm finding that it isnt as bad as i made it out to be miyagi is still miyagi just as kool as ever the musical score is still there pleasant as ever and swank's character isnt that bad her acting is pretty good considering the script it beats the third installment by a wide margin so my original rating of 4 has been raised to 7
<START> i don't know how expensive was the creation of this movie but the effects were awful half of the movie was filmed on stage in front of a movie canvas that's sure that blue box wouldn't look so artificial when they traveled on a boat the background canvas was moved imitating the movement of waves but the characters weren't moving the cgi effects terrible i am not sure but i guess the effect were created with paint and made a sequence of them next time the creators should hire a professional cgi maker team it looks like the cgi creator would have drawn on the picture strip with shaky hands awful that's sure when i first saw the trailer i thought it was created in 1983 one of my friend told me the correct date 2005 my jaw dropped i was so shocked i thought he was kidding people i recommend you to skip this movie the story is also twisted you won't enjoy it
<START> i think it's the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed there were two reasons why i went to see et les vikings first as a film buff and second as a big fan br br in the end the film doesn't satisfy any request it's simply a big animated mess and it proves that the franchise is going from bad to worse br br in fact it has been this way since the death of first scenarist renÃ© in 1977 his faithful collaborator illustrator albert took his place but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the years br br et les vikings is based on the book et les which was published during the reign the basic story is the same arrives to the village and et must turn him into a real man while the vikings come to in order to discover what fear is because it seems that fear gives wings br br the similarities end here what follows in the book is a non stop series of laughs gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the vikings do discover fear and they flee the movie is silly unfunny fast paced corny well just name a default and it has good chances of being applied br br the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good but the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit even older movies such as le which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily better br br animation has the quality of other 21st century movies but it has its faults and any film beginner could find the mistakes the greatest example is the continuity mistake where the day follows the night after a fraction of second in the same sequence br br imagine they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can't get adequate film making br br the changes of the original story are simply unbearable and they still could be even if there was no original story in the movie has a pet pigeon named and who act as his cell phone the viking chief has a rebellious teen daughter named abba and she constantly defies her father's authority there's also a stupid viking wizard his cartoonish dumb and muscular son the faithful bride of who is obsessed with decoration her name is and well i can't stand that much longer br br we're far from the original gags from the original book the biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen i remember that the greatest moments in the book were laughing at the names which all finish in and tries to scare them in ridiculous ways br br and if everything wasn't enough somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there's an already existing cÃ©line dion song which would be featured in the final credits if it was a new song i could have understood but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they're ready to do anything in order to attract film goers br br the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't walk out of the theater without being left cold in a summer release it just can't hurt br br the only other acceptable point of the movie is how becomes courageous his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible while it's better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believable br br so if you haven't seen the movie yet don't waste your money on it grab the book instead br br oh renÃ© why did you leave us
<START> one of the worst theatrical movies of the year if not all time anthony hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke i can't believe david mamet and ridley scott's name appear on this travesty the best career move jody foster ever made was turning this one down julianne moore was as emotionless throughout as a female keanu reeves gary oldman was of course his brilliant self he is a crippled victim of hannibal and the make up is so good i didn't know it was gary until the final credits but eaten by trained boars give me a break rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits and frying and feeding his own brain to ray liotta i was laughing at the absurdity no make that stupidity of this flick at this point i haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since who's that girl br br pay someone else to go for you if you must but miss this one at all cost
<START> my two daughters ages 11 and 13 and i were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night we were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was david duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and minnie driver gave her usually competent performance some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny especially one scene minnie driver has with a fellow transplant i liked the fact that it was a movie that i could watch with my children and i wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves thumbs up bonnie hunt
