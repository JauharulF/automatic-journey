<START> even a decade after frontline aired on the abc near as i can tell current affairs programmes are still using the same tricks over and over time after time today tonight and a current affair are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight loss and dodgy shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff pieces having often been subjected to that entertainment less void between 'the simpsons' at 6 00 pm and of the century' or at 7 00 pm i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings br br fortunately four rising comedians Â rob jane kennedy santo and tom Â were also all too aware of all this and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly hilarious media satires you'll ever see on television the four entertainers had already met with comedic success their previous most memorable television stint being on 'the late show ' the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992 1993 and also featured fellow comedians mick tony martin jason stephens and judith lucy br br frontline boasts an ensemble of colourful characters each with their own distinct and quirky personality the current affairs show is headed by nicely groomed mike moore rob an ambitious pretentious dim witted narcissist mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society Â he is always adamant that they maintain their journalistic integrity Â and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion br br brooke vandenberg jane kennedy is the senior female reporter on the show she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile and if the rumours are to be believed she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence another equally amoral reporter marty di is portrayed by mora who memorably played inept solicitor dennis in the australian comedy classic 'the castle ' emma ward alison is the line producer on the show and the single shining beacon of morality on the frontline set then there's the highly amusing weatherman geoffrey santo mike's best friend and confidant geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with mike's opinion and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesn't get them br br for each of the shows three seasons we are treated to a different ep executive producer brian thompson bruno lawrence who unfortunately passed away in 1995 runs the programme during season 1 he has a decent set of morals and is always civil to his employees and yet is more than willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings sam murphy kevin j wilson arrives on set in season 2 a hard nosed smooth talking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along the last episode of the second season when mike finally gets the better of him is a classic moment prowse steve ep for the third season is crude unpleasant and unashamedly sexist it's therefore remarkable that you eventually come to like him br br with its cast of distinctive exaggerated characters frontline has a lot of fun satirising current affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply often implementing many plot ideas from recent real life situations but this never really detracts from the show's ten years on celebrity cameos come in abundance with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline hanson don burke and jon english watch out for harry shearer's hilarious appearance in the season 2 episode changing the face of current affairs playing larry an american hired by the network to reform the show br br particularly in the third season i noticed that frontline boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour uncharacteristic for such a light hearted comedy show genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion murder by a crazed gunman and mike treacherously betraying his best friend's hopes and dreams only to be told that he is a good friend the series' final minute Â minus an added scene during the credits which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced Â was probably the greatest blackest ending to a comedy series that i've yet seen br br below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite frontline episodes but make no mistake every single half hour is absolutely hilarious and hard hitting satire br br 1 the siege season 1 br br 2 give 'em enough rope season 2 br br 3 addicted to fame season 3 br br 4 basic instincts season 2 br br 5 add sex and stir season 1
<START> i grew up watching the bowery boys on the weekends and even at young an age i could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies still it was fun to watch hall get the better of gorcey after would beat the crap out him the east side kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch enter the year 2005 and i am about my childhood i can't find any bowery boys on dvd but i found the east side kids on disc and also on a public domain website thankfully i saved my dough and saw bowery blitz on the web for free and it really really blows now i can see there are some bowery boys and maybe monogram bad movie lovers here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 of 10 but c'mon folks this ain't even trying to be funny it's an east side kids drama not a comedy so it's no good the best part was seeing fight at the end he reminded me of my grade school days away like a girl when i would get in a fight it was kinda leonard maltin said in his mini bio that this flick is one of the better ones so you can just imagine the rest if you wanna see some halfway decent east side action see ghosts on the loose maybe but the bottom line is usually a comedy team starts out strong in their career and tapers off these mugs blew chucks early on then slowly picked it up until hall's antics dominated than they were at best still 2nd tier stuff way below the 3 stooges who they imitate but amusing for those who grew up with them this feature won't bring back pleasant bowery boys memories and is best left to monogram fanatics
<START> well this is the best comedy movie i have ever seen my both favorite actors did good job salman khan and aamir khan rocked hope to see part 2 soon as i heard they will come back with part 2 as well i have request to those who haven't watched it yet please buy dvd and watch it u wont feel bored i am watching this movie 1 times a week all other was also good in this movie paresh rawal shakti and others the music is also good it have also nice songs there are some sense which will kill u from laughing salman khan did very nice role and also aamir br br so must watch movie excellent job by actors and director
<START> i disagree with dante portraying the democrat supporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of 23 i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that something in the order of a iq a single digit figure please br br the moh series is quite uneven and this is the very worst episode dante yet another mindless hollywood liberal or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the leftist establishment in order to re kindle his pitiful career must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now hence came up with this cringe inducing unsubtle left wing satire of the bush administration republicans and capitalism perhaps he felt he hadn't been overtly political before he wouldn't exactly be the first no talent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career when all else fails the maker of turds such as piranha the howling and matinee dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as adolf hitler had been to world peace br br th uses lowest common denominator humour cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all blue collar union members wouldn't have trouble understanding or have you ever seen a clever subtle intelligent liberal satire populist manure has the basest of all messages hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as sean penn's name and what better people to send this message to the popcorn munching sheep than a couple of cocaine sniffing tinseltown losers who've all fallen so low that they're forced to write for tv br br i don't want political propaganda either left or right in any type of movie but placing it in horror of all genres is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among hollywood's anti intelligentsia so vapid was dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote democrat that's what you get for finishing a movie school not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination
<START> i can never figure if this is the artiest soap opera ever produced or the art movie no matter john is utterly ravishing novel is not reduced but for once elevated to film if there is a fault it is in the original novel not in anthony beautiful movie anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book and probably cannot read i do not like repeating adjectives but ravishing serves the purpose br br apart from the storyline the players excel but it is the australian sense of light and shade that ultimately triumphs like some dutch master uses a blast of light where van rijn would have used shade one could weep for cinematography this magnificent
<START> there's something wonderful about a revenge film everyone wakes up in the morning believing he she is the star of the movie and that anyone who interferes with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self esteem rather than fighting back in the moment the hero draws upon built up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium quite naturally in the real world this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences a good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill in the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved br br swimming with sharks is advertised as a comedy no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity it's dark but it isn't dark comedy company of men and the works of todd solondz come much closer parts of the film are so brutal they pre date the current torture porn genre everyone is so obsessed with saw hostel there are some laughs there are laughs in saving private ryan too but it isn't labeled comedy br br the intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case it is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the mistreatment the hero aptly named guy is an everyman so vague we know literally nothing about him what does he do with his spare time does he have friends family how did he get where he is what are his interests this becomes a running motif through the film no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle what do you want the answer to which we are denied by a vague cheat of an ending it's very difficult to care for such a character even if acted well even tom hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll such as punchline kevin spacey as the boss buddy is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor the best laughs came when he abused his assistant he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what guy will endure when kevin's character is being tortured the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality at this point any message the author had has been lost there's no hero in this film ergo no reason to care at all br br it's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business i worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far fetched i had similar wish fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that i was justified i thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story actually the only woman there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film just by being your eager naive self that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self as the film points out if guy was so unhappy he only had to leave the film doesn't offer any denouement at all surprise ending notwithstanding we still know nothing about the protagonists we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too in short there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that shock the film business can be pretty brutal br br there are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge style fantasies both the feel good variety 9 working girl the devil wears prada and not so much war of the roses the remake of the hills have eyes this isn't one of them despite a fun turn by benicio del toro in the emily blunt role from prada and some interesting work by spacey and michelle forbes this is a frustrating mean confused and slightly dull creation of self indulgence from a director who has one hopes worked it all out by now
<START> this show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny br br terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom they both deserved better but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes june talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion when she is not being a foil to terry and she really is clever br br the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class middle aged comedy and many people remember it fondly but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image
<START> if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator requiem is probably not the way to go in summary alien lands in typical american town predator lands in american town both have a bit of a fight us government blows up town some people get away i'm sorry i think i might have spoilt the ending its easy to criticise someone who's being critical people cry out i bet you couldn't do any better i bet i could having made this film watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room
<START> the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either chaplin's score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done the problem with this compilation is a minor one yet annoying the shorts have been stretch printed to fit the 24 frame p s speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p s this results is jerky motion that doesn't look very attractive and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time it's just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed there are separate restored versions of these classics available even on dvd and it would not be a problem to restore the image but alas this has not been done br br a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article but i say again a minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating the shorts are still worth '10'
<START> this is one of those movies i watched and wondered why did i watch it what did i find so interesting about it being a truck driver myself i didn't find it very realistic no i've never used a nor have i ever seen nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar rv either br br same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question until the end of the movie and well he still really didn't and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut' when the prostitute gets 200 00 well 150 00 after his cut yeah br br i still laugh at the lot lizard comment made them's lot lizards they'll screw anything with 20 bucks and some are men dressed as woman or something equally as weird meaning we're better then them as we may still be prostitutes but we get paid better br br other then that it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home she's 18 remember and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing dead end job at least she had a roof over her head and a job she turned five tricks on the road i wonder if the 750 00 she made was worth it i'd guess not
<START> i could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer but the lure of the dvd box got me to rent it anyway boy was i right br br also for some reason the dvd version is very fuzzy and unclear at times in terms of video quality it appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder it looks so bad i really did not like the plot and after watching the movie i was very let down i will not tell any spoilers but let it be said that the end was so bad that i laughed it has been done so many times before br br the whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler's english paper if i had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie i've ever seen this one may just be it i can't believe they actually released this film it really isn't worth the rent or a penny of anyone's money unless you want a good laugh at the movie's expense
<START> this is one of the best presentations of the 60's put on film arthur penn director of bonnie and clyde and little big man saw that steve outstanding script rang with truth and from these two talents comes solid cinema jodi georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps but always just out of reach just see it or you cinematic education will be incomplete
<START> after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s rock hudson starred in lots of different projects including tv shows and lesser films however i believe that embryo is his only turn as a mad scientist and that's probably a good thing i guess he needed the work br br driving along one dark and stormy night brilliant dr paul hudson hits and injures a doberman which he brings back to his lab that looks somewhat like a dank midwestern basement he then manages to raise the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being he raises victoria the beautiful barbara carrera from a fetus the same way victoria grows at an astonishing pace and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young woman br br predictably things go very wrong after a halcyon beginning sister in law martha diane ladd begins to wonder where the young woman came from and victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of smokey and the bandit after which has shockingly aged in just a few assaulted by a frantic who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child all of this is accompanied by screeching tires roaring engines a car fire and lots of sirens the limp bunch of paramedics frantically working on victoria while writhes in more labored than creepy br br although just made in 1976 this movie is very dated the only difference between this and the many 1940s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff the sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to today's audiences to the extent that hudson's reel to reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role giving the impression that he's truly a washed up movie star while ladd and carrera are much more believable surprisingly roddy mcdowall pops up briefly as a chess player br br the passport video transfer is very substandard looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment if you're nostalgic for 1976 watch this once just to say you did otherwise watch a football game or soap opera instead
<START> the hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time this film produced by screenwriter paddy who gave us the oscar winning film network deals with overworked staff gross incompetence and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in manhattan george c scott in a superb performance as the head physician is driven to alcoholism and a death wish as he tries to recover from a divorce throwing his son out of the house and worst of all a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured br br mr scott makes the movie his own and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment you can feel the pain pun intended of what this hospital has done to him the vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene br br if only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out this picture would be brilliant unfortunately there is a sub plot of scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient the patient has been murdering people at the hospital this is where credibility of the picture becomes strained the romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture and the mental patient posing as a doctor i found to be totally unbelievable a simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings it takes almost the whole movie before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital i could not see one person doing that much damage even as corrupt as this hospital is br br furthermore george c scott's character is overworked another pun intended because the script has too many things happening at once for example within a period of 20 minutes you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do with the nurses and aids it's the same story someone's chart was read wrong someone was given the wrong medication and died the doctor operated on the wrong patient than another doctor does the same thing blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break there is also a lot of subtle dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer br br this repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable however the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie when the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and scott's reactions to this you are glued to the screen but the conversations between scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type who done it scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie when the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings i wondered the following why did the producers need the find the killer mad patient sub plot i think the only point of scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter was to give him anybody with whom to communicate the hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love interest and mad patient scenes it should have focused on the incompetent b s within its walls more frequently in an era where this movie could have been phenomenal the sub plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been
<START> overall the movie heart of darkness was pitiful compared to the book anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws there is an immeasurable difference between the two it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle i couldn't imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating heart of darkness the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation br br first capturing the details of the story is unattainable the colossal fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie if you have taken on the enormous task of tackling conrad's work then you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader you as the reader are required to be capable of and connecting joseph conrad's ideas as a result several crucial details are absent in the movie br br also although the movie was an adequate length the film seemed short it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters marlow was much more of a stranger the viewpoint of the book puts you into marlow's shoes however in the movie you're almost watching marlow from a distance i began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same read between the lines method as conrad did however the connections were weak i know that if i had not read the book then i would in no way be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters br br finally kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly his role was short and the details weren't all included it was impossible to comprehend the true kurtz in the length of time he was shown an important detail in the book was that kurtz had become a god to the africans i didn't think that significant detail was defined also in the book kurtz represented a soulless being he had died inside long ago i believe the director comprehended this detail however instead of recreating it he just had kurtz mope around and mumble everything moreover it seemed like the director attempted to make kurtz seem mysterious however instead he seemed entirely unidentified br br altogether this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project due the next day it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time the characters were alienated crucial details were left out and overall the central plot was lost in translation
