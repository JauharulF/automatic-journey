<START> considering the appalling track record of mick since going out on his own i had rather low expectations of crackerjack even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous in fact if it wasn't for the fact that i'd received free tickets to the preview i would have resisted the pressure from the missus who thinks mick's a hunk there's a worry to pay money for it br br the first few minutes of the movie had me worried it starts with one of tired get angry at insignificant things routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing the rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted even the typical mick and judith lucy humour was delivered well and whilst i never had to pick myself up from the aisles it generated a lot more chuckles that i was expecting and it was br br there's nothing new in the plot pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one liners and other jokes i never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short mick must have worked hard on polishing his script there were a one or two late show in jokes and one or two jokes that only would get but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience br br something that i found disappointing was the relative of john clarke he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy but that doesn't detract from the movie too much br br over all i enjoyed this comedy and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie i left the cinema with a decent sized grin a pretty hard thing for an australian comedy to do in my books 7 5 10 br br
<START> this movie has all the qualities to be good stan singing dancing falling is very funny i think he handled his character in the best way possible it's a parody and very well done maybe times can change there's another audience but if you want to laugh come on see it
<START> is a long excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist after whom the movie is named young gas poisoned first world war lieutenant of very delicate health who previously was a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental goes in a search of their new location and finds much more than he ever intended to and quite of a different nature depressive atmosphere of ultimate despair where the insane ones are much less horrible than the sane where the madness is a kind of poetry will hold you hypnotized from the very first frames of this film to the last and all the beauty beauty of the winter and mountains beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods i don't even know how all the sorrow and sadness of last days of war could be made so beautiful
<START> at first i thought ka man' might be one of those progressive new filipino films as someone noted earlier the movie does not look poorly made it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot better angles better sound equipment good looking actors and nicer locations br br however the improvements are all purely superficial if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filters ka man' would feel just like your typical second rate local movie hyperactive drama predictable plot twists yeah right moments crying screaming and characters you could care less about all shoved down your throat br br a couple of things annoyed me about this movie first of all since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family that not blood related argument does not make an ounce of difference second would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped simply because the father told her to keep it secret and where the hell were the lights in this movie i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic but i was simply forced to turn up the brightness feature on my tv set
<START> i am no ebert what i am is a compassionate and i have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than i felt for leland p fitzgerald sorry if i do not offer a critique but i see nothing but perfection in this film i am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things i do but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren't expecting i've read that the character of leland was flawed it seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the question this movie presents i feel sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers this movie delivers open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this leland p fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning story with extraordinary acting ryan gosling deserves to be talked about
<START> this 3 hour made for tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster's this weekend the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets costuming bridget fonda especially and special effects including a great jim henson talking polar bear reindeer they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script the story line was so loose that it really never came together one can overlook irish accented germans but not herky jerky storytelling with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads
<START> my dinner with jimi is a glimpse at howard giddy and vertiginous ride to fame with his 60's folk rock band the turtles the turtles were kind of a 'second act during the sixties but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat drink and party with the titans of hippie culture and not only that they had the musical chops to back it up many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they interact with the band at work and at play this provides my only complaint about the film almost from the beginning of the movie one sees that it is nearly impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars too often during the film i felt that i was watching an engaging exhibition of phony wigs and mustaches but if you are a fan of the music of the turtles or the swinging 60's in general this might be the film for you and don't forget to view the extras there is a very funny and informative bit by band members mark and howard about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents
<START> it's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution br br sure it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity but by god the production value is the lowest i've ever seen the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment everything is overlit giving everything an amateurish look bringing your thought to america's worst home video's or whatever that show was called br br please people is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this you really should have done some short projects first cause it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs 1 10
<START> you can't take it realistically sheets br br zombie bloodbath 2 is a world all of its own i've really never seen anything like it the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs forgive the don't simply mean that it's incoherent and absurd though occasionally it is i mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you and when it's over you find that it's all happened while you were sitting on the couch br br it is worth noting that it's extremely low budget as a disclaimer to those who after seeing shaun of the dead consider themselves fans of underground zombie films also of note is that it is much more brutal than you'd expect children get disemboweled and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin her corpse is subsequently raped these are certainly not flaws and indeed i feel it is to the film's credit but if it doesn't sound like your kind of movie don't waste your time br br i don't mean to over hype it regarding brutality don't go in expecting inside or something i hesitate to give away any of the plot because it's really full of surprises even the opening scene which has nothing to do with zombies is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original br br man i'm three paragraphs in and i've hardly said anything at all here's why i thought the movie was awesome 1 it's big and it keeps moving at one point you expect it to turn into another notld clone a board up the windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another by the end of the film however the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream there are also a number of outdoor urban scenes these are rare in low budget zombie films br br 2 the makeup gore is much better than zb1 more convincing and more creative something kind of funny the early zombies look really lame then halfway through they suddenly look really good with prosthetics and everything some of them look like fulci zombies some are reminiscent of mr tongue from day of the dead and it's got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around never gets old br br 3 there's something oddly emotional about it one character asserts that heaven exists and that our dead undead protagonists are now in heaven in the context of the film we believe it to be true though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity they genuinely seem to care about each other and accordingly i found myself caring about them br br 4 the pacing is great there's hardly a dull moment br br my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i've ever heard i personally feel it adds to the experience but i don't think he does it on purpose so i can't fairly give the film a perfect rating example when a car breaks down the owner yells at the passengers then he says something to the effect of sorry i yelled at you guys you don't know what it's like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you're five years old wtf at the very end it gets to be more than i can handle involves a montage with bill clinton and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor really by this point i was firmly re living my drug experiences br br highly recommended 7 10
<START> i couldn't help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996 apparently email is an interactive discussion similar to a chat with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud and some of the other tech aspects are also laugh out loud funny i'd swear the high tech communications centre she has actually has a few commodore 64 monitors in it almost like watching the movie hackers nowadays i guess br br despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can't ignore i mean why include something so stupid br br anyway to sum up the plot is pretty predictable the acting bad the killer quite but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre 3000 kind of way i guess
<START> g m started a the odd couple downstairs in man about the house and went on to amusing the nation in their own sitcom br br what was the typical small scale personal charm of the couples chemistry on the small screen g m's to the big screen was as appalling as and wise and countless fine tv shows br br unfunny unsatisfying and featuring an ill yootha joyce who died before the film was released
<START> one night at 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br according to harald the director of one night at this film is a dark comedy about the power of women over men and how a group of people can all perceive different realities it's the same story told from three different points of view and each time we tell the story we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened which nobody really knows br br one night at marks the feature film directorial debut of an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old i always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking we have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another advertisement or music video for tv with their productions resists that tendency he captures a specific humorous truth in one night at from an inventive complex screenplay by the late stan even if it is often somewhat perplexing br br one night at features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman in some ways this movie is the comedy version of american beauty but in others it is a world apart br br it all started one night at explains each of the three men to their various listeners there is randy matt dillon a tender at the local bar and his cousin a lawyer named carl paul reiser who stays until the place closes detective john goodman arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named jewel liv tyler randy is the first to see her as an individual treats her unkindly he stands up for her and before you can say sexy they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him at first randy is reluctant the sex and the violence all in one night Â it's a little much but who could turn a jewel like jewel away br br jewel changes the lives of each of the three men for detective she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died for carl she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household for randy she lights a few fires both positive and negative the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named michael douglas to put an end to her deceptive ways br br it is interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicles even the costuming of jewel is relative to the man telling the story sees jewel as a beautiful mesmerizing gift from god carl sees jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage randy is unsure what to make of her an awakening to his otherwise boring road to nowhere life the most intriguing element of this movie is jewel herself however deliciously played by the always delightful liv tyler armageddon she is not really interested in the men but what they can offer her her motives are all too simple not truthfully diabolical or evil she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty br br the film has a lot of fun with its material from the enthusiastically entertaining cast to its violently hilarious showdown one night at takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas what makes the movie even funnier is how the three men's points of view differ the actors have a lot of fun with their characters too goodman is curiously whimsical reiser fits his kinky squirmy part quite well douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movie's funniest performances dillon gives his character arrogant personality even though randy is a lackluster nobody liv tyler is dazzling she injects jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing wit she reminds us of mena intimate performance in american beauty br br one night at is the first film to come from michael douglas' new production company films it is a creative genuine and sexy production along the way we often become caught up in the twisty structure but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several angles to a single story the movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic this is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way i e the black comedy many films of this genre come across as either too black or too lackadaisical one night at is one of the few that actually work br br
<START> of the korean movies i've seen only three had really stuck with me the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters the second and third and now fourth too have all been park chan movies namely oldboy sympathy for lady vengeance and now thirst br br park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his irreverence towards convention all his movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense it's more like he shows us what we don't expect to see typically situations that go radically against society's morals like incest or a libidinous blood sucking yet devout priest he's also quite artistically inclined with regards to cinematography and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i've seen br br thirst is all that being about said priest and the repressed conscience less woman he falls for and more it's horror drama and even comedy as park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations as such this might be his best work for me yet since his other two movies that i've seen were lacking the humor element that would've made them more palatable for repeat viewings
<START> i saw bandit queen in 2005 over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in india the language the stark treatment and the natural acting by a relatively unknown cast for that time might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema the film the cast and shekhar kapoor deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort br br the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india in fact there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself the reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen and survived to tell the tale survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994 br br the film scores on several counts the cinematography is brilliant the music is apt the cast many of whom became more familiar names later is very good but the screenplay is patchy things move too fast and in jerks at times it's understandable though because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive or maybe i felt that because i have read mala sen's book which is a more detailed and better though obviously not as shocking as the visual account of travails and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film br br there are some factual ambiguities too according to devi she wasn't present when the massacre took place and despite claiming to be the dictated account of herself she is shown to participate and in fact initiate the massacre then the final scene where surrenders shows her touching the feet of the chief minister while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of mahatma gandhi symbolic value only but shows that didn't want to show servitude to a living ordinary person it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to arjun singh who many remember was the cm of then br br but these are small chinks in this eminently well made movie a rare gem to come out from the mainstream indian film industry made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80s mr india
<START> mgm hodgepodge of jimmy durante throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood no major stars show up we get the three stooges laurel hardy durante and lupe velez i didn't recognize anyone else they were probably unknowns for good reason the movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography the only things that save this from being a total disaster are laurel hardy's battle with lupe velez and a wonderful color disney cartoon called the hot chocolate soldier it's a beautiful very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost otherwise the movie is a colossal bore there's no director credited what does that tell you
