<START> i love musicals all of them from joyous oklahoma to poignant and bess to the touching romantic damn yankees and i know most of the songs sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alone br br in a real musical as differentiated from this vaudeville show every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment it is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltation a natural extension where mere words fail so in guys and dolls my time of day describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing of song br br for this lover of the broadway musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre there the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines while here the songs simply picked up from a collection only interfered with the shaky premise of the film br br perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love as achieved in sweet charity br br let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review perhaps another day another mood i could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this review br br but i can't help but imagining what richard roger oscar hammerstein cole porter irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise i think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and i can not help but to mourn the great loss
<START> if you have plenty of time to kill and the dvd was given to you by your friend for free but still it may require lot of courage to watch this film which does not have good script or humor for that matter br br on the acting front is frozen in time acting tushar kapoor was slightly better than in this movie paresh rawal was good at comedy was usual br br the story revolves around a college campus where is a bad boy n tushar is the good one they pretend to be the opposite of respective nature and so the story goes on br br watch it only if you don't have any thing to do and the film is running on your local cable tv
<START> i had to watch this one for my canadian cinema course and i was told that it was considered to be the best canadian film when i watched this i really did not agree considering i've seen a lot better ones i understand that there were canadian themes and messages but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me as a spectator it made me not really care what the film was trying to tell me the plot was too dry the characters did not have many positive personality traits but this is to emphasize the messages not to tick off spectators this film shows a little about the history of quebec not a very interesting film it definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal
<START> i actually went into this film with some expectations not because i thought the film sounded particularly good but because i'm a fan of italian exploitation flicks and with a cast that sees franco nero and telly savalas starring alongside oliver twist i figured it had to be interesting at least well redneck does have one or two positive things going on but for the most part it's a dull lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is pointless the plot simply focuses on two criminals nero and savalas who kidnap a young kid oliver the twist in the tale is that the kid realises that he'd have more fun if he gets accepted into the 'gang' telly savalas and franco nero are two actors that have proved they can carry a film on their own on numerous occasions and they do have some memorable moments in this film although really for all the wrong reasons savalas in particular gives a silly portrayal of the 'bad' criminal the plot doesn't flow badly but since nothing interesting happens that's not really a positive point and doesn't save from the film from being mediocre overall i can't recommend this film it may appeal to some for its cult value but it didn't do anything for me
<START> i challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement that is if you can stop looking at her practically flawless face she also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting but not nearly as much as i was hoping for the film is extremely slow moving and low budgeted though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated nearly the entire crew is on suspended animation and the ship moves on auto pilot and the heroine doesn't rescue any of them or bring anything useful back home it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end there are also some long but rather tame soft core scenes and a couple of alien rip off monsters that kill about 2 people 1 2 out of 4
<START> i saw this film without knowing much about it at all the split screen device was immediately irritating and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence had finished the plot characters and dialogue were all extremely cliched poor guy from abusive family gets thrown out of home wants to get out of his reinvents himself changes his voice dresses in others' clothes is adopted by a gay man who he proceeds to on his way up to becoming part of an international set of drug taking british aristocrats br br the estate of patricia highsmith talented mr ripley should be suing the makers of this film the triple screen to me together with the over 120 min duration emphasises the almost non existent editing can't decide which image works and is the most powerful why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them this gimmick removed any connection or interest i had with any of the characters important dialogue was repeated 3 times across each screen as if to say 'this is an important moving deep moment ok ' br br don't waste your time br br
<START> the real plot br br a group of post civil war prostitutes seek alternative housing in fort boom lacy everett and a close knit family of call girls have been eating date expired sausages for days and plan to move into the former fort mcmillian locals warn the women of eating more of the dated sausage because there is a vicious pyromaniac loose in the area and he refuse to shuttle them out to the property when they finally arrive at their destination they discover their stomach is full of gass after all the bad sausage it is not long before they learn why their new home is called fort boom
<START> i have seen many movies over the years and i am a big fan of comedies br br but this so called comedy almost reduced me to tears it is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever witnessed the worst br br i remember hearing about this movie from a friend and decided to view it if i could i could turn back time i would i will regret for as long as i live the time i wasted watching this rubbish br br the storyline is so insane it just makes no sense at all and leaves you confused there is a scottish mob and a german who are after vargas john leguizamo the scottish mob after 50 000 dollars and the germans after his head br br in trying to escape the pest takes the form of many disguises but in doing this we witness some of the most annoying worst mind numbing acting dialogue and sounds in cinema history this movie annoyed me so much by the end i was full of aggression i was so angry that i had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide i mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made br br i know people have their own opinions but the most shocking thing about the pest is that people actually like it why what is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last a man who cannot act who has an annoying voice and confusing face br br i sat through it thinking the movie would get better surely it would it did not usually you want the good guy to survive but i wanted the germans or the scottish mob to find and kill the pest anything to put me out of my misery there is nothing funny interesting or normal that happens in this movie its just plain annoying and confusing the jokes are dead even before they are told i feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made but actually have to film this drivel i wouldn't be surprised if they are receiving counselling br br if you want to remain sane and part of society my advice is to never watch this movie i'd rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again br br i don't think i'll ever hate anything more than this
<START> not since 8 heads in a duffel bag and the how high previews br br have i laughed so little at something that the film makers thought br br would be hysterical br br jerry lewis is the richest man in the world he is rejected as 4 f br br by the army and decides to use his money to raise his own army br br of about half a dozen he then impersonates a nazi commander in br br italy and eventually tries to kill hitler that is the description of the br br flimsy plot br br this film is as funny as a heart attack this film makes hogan's br br heroes look like shakespeare if the money men of the br br producers had really wanted to lose their cash they should have br br shown this film i cannot stress how bad this thing is br br lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting the br br action from two different angles then being edited together this br br sitcom type of direction works on television but here it is an br br obvious attempt to cheat the audience he ends most of his br br scenes with a still shot as if giving the viewer a chance to double br br over in stitches before going to the next tired set up i spent most of br br the movie doubled over in abdominal agony accompanied with br br severe flatulence over this thing br br lewis the director and producer sets the film in 1943 but makes br br no attempt to use period costumes or sets everyone wears the br br latest style and has the latest interior design for 1970 the br br supporting cast is lost as lewis goes off on his patented tangents br br which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to br br watch when lewis becomes the nazi commander he spends the br br last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a br br performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring br br in at the beginning br br the final embarassing shot has lewis and his cronies trying to br br put one over on the japanese they wear buck teeth squint their br br eyes and talk in a funny accent it may be one of the most br br blatantly racist occurrences since the camps i was br br slack jawed at what lewis did through this whole thing but that put br br me over the edge watch for kaye ballard's very tasteless scene br br where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again br br star trek 's george takei has two small scenes then wisely br br drops out of the picture this has less laughs than mel brooks' last br br three films combined there is nothing sadder than watching a br br formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly you br br actually feel ashamed for them jim carrey learned that with the br br majestic but jerry lewis still shows up on television once in a br br while pulling the same unfunny schtick i feel sorry for him br br which way to the front is cheap unfunny offensive and stupid br br i feel bad for everyone involved and anyone who must endure this br br i do not recommend it br br though rated g this contains some physical violence some gun br br violence and some adult situations if your child shows interest in br br seeing this please consult professional help br br
<START> this movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion there are some good performances but the subplots are extraneous and largely unresolved br br in addition i found all the characters unlikeable and if you can't identify with at least one character there isn't much to get excited about all in all this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little
<START> i watch a lot of movies a lot of movies getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch 2 3 flicks a day for years it all gets very exhausting mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare is it when i get surprised by something mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to be br br death bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its genius br br the rhythm of the piece is psychotic it's structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame it's not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy the most pretentious way i can phrase it is this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie i mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people and fried chicken out in the middle of nowhere and there's bone hands i can barely articulate my feelings about this film and yeah copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule but things get real same y after awhile its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down from what it is to how its put together we need films like that movies that shake us out of our complacency consider it like existential camp it's fun and it's stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way the worst horror villain of all time maybe but at least it isn't a guy in a mask
<START> this is a poor film it certainly belongs in the how not to make a feature film category story direction acting and style are all flat as a pancake story consists of five Â yes five Â football matches spread out over the film's duration each one more boringly filmed than the last as a dysfunctional amateur football team go from strength to strength that's it that's the plot it's hard to know who this film is aimed at it's too banal for football fans and there's nothing in it for teens nor grown ups there's nothing in it for women either there isn't even a single female character it's dreariness wears you down as the team play game after game after game after game after game the story such as it is dialogue and mannerisms seem lifted from a bygone ireland with all the actors spouting cod theatrical dublin accents it doesn't have to be seen to be believed avoid at all costs can someone give me back my 90 minutes high point the credits at the end low point too numerous to mention brendan gleeson is in this film
<START> this film should never have been made it stinks it's awful it's no good it's bad it's terrible starting to see a pattern here jackie mason is certainly no rodney dangerfield gone were ted knight and bill murray who along with dangerfield were essential to the first film it seems that the three of them the stars all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one the one who didn't have the good sense to bow out of this was chevy chase who stuck around but was extraneous to both films in my opinion this film is quite simply not funny nor does it have any other endearing qualities this thing relies heavily on anti semitism to work and it works to it's detriment i hated this thing a waste of everybody's time
<START> operation scorpio scorpion king doesn't slip into top gear until the last 25 minutes or so but when the action does hit top speed it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer's attention that is not to say that the first hour is just that compared to the final fight fest it seems a bit underwhelming br br the plot revolves around yuk su a talented comic artist who dreams of being a like those he depicts in his drawings when yuk su rescues a young maid siu yu who is being sold into prostitution he incurs the wrath of her evil boss wa led by sonny master of scorpion style kung fu henchmen give chase to yuk su and the maid yuk father intervenes but he is injured after being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders the three eventually hide out at a noodle restaurant owned by their friend master yat br br yuk su learns to cooks noodles but also regularly sneaks out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of jean the teacher of the musclebound who rescued them when master yat must leave on business yuk su is left in charge of the kitchen however he pops out to practise his skills with jean leaving siu yu to serve the customers sonny and his men visit the restaurant and disgusted by the noodles they are served trash the restaurant br br when master yat learns that yuk su has been sneaking out he tells him that he should have learnt kung fu from him it transpires that master yat used to be a top triad assassin until he decided to try and change his ways under the guidance of master yat yuk su improves his skills even learning the art of the shadowless kick yuk su eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend fatty announces that his maid has also been sold into prostitution with jean they visit wa posing as french brothel keepers looking for new women when fatty's maid is presented to them she accidentally blows their ruse and at last the action kicks off big style despite his best efforts jean is badly beaten by sonny and he and yuk su are forced to flee on returning to the restaurant yuk su finds it ablaze and worst of all the bad guys have found siu yu yuk su accompanied by master yat returns to place to try and rescue siu yu br br despite some fairly entertaining training scenes the slow build up to the final action at house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes it is a shame that the tedium wasn't broken up by a decent scrap midway rather than saving all of the juicy stuff until the end br br the last fight however is worth the wait in the end won jin gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking sonny who flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity and chin kar lok gives a solid performance as yuk su the artist turned fighter also particularly good is old school kung fu star lau kar leung aka liu chia liang as master yat proving that this old timer has still got what it takes to kick ass although not a perfect film operation scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing br br nb i may have got some of the names wrong my dvd calls characters by different names than those listed on imdb
<START> peter strauss by nature of appearing in mini series and made for tv films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channel hopped into it half way through well i've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the jericho mile that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film br br peter strauss won an emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br br looking to be objective i attempted to criticise this film instead i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit picks this is what true realistic film making is about this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted it's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event
