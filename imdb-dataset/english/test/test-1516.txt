<START> before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema 1 your average completely uninspired fare i e constantine and 2 the work that is charmingly bad or so bad it's good a la manos the hands of fate now that i've seen dr gore i know there is a third kind of bad movie the utter crap sandwich that will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory a work that is mind bendingly execrable anathema br br i have hated certain films before but i've never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its hold and became self loathing have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it but makes you grieve for another hour after that mystery science theatre disciples beware this is soul sucking cinema go rent circle of iron or the killer shrews instead
<START> i really wanted to like this movie because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved ghouls another of films it did have some almost good moments like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure but on the whole it was just boring and mildly unpleasant br br the unimaginable shocks that came up with were really predictable and worn out poop murdering prostitutes incest could have still been good but poorly done unsure whether it was trying to offend amuse or both ultimately did neither br br in conclusion we watch troma movies because we want films with heart this film did not consistently feel like it had heart there were some good scenes but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant
<START> i was surprised to catch this on tv friday and i enjoyed it between the presence of bobbie phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered cyberpunk this was a fun movie to watch i enjoyed the story which reminded me of a book i've read earth david and was fun to see on tv bobbie looks great but i also enjoyed her performance as kam because she did seem different from everyone else but the greatest thing about this movie was the atmosphere that has been described in books by gibson sterling and others it was just fun to see it on tv
<START> i loved this movie it's a lot of laughs the acting is good and the writing is really sharp i'd rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves br br it's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together why do you have a ten line minimum i'm not a critic just a patron br br i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence this movie should be seen on more screens than just one i laughed from beginning to end
<START> do not watch this movie go see something else i was very disappointed i cannot rate this movie any better than 3 the acting was quite good and i really liked william dafoe as the villain but i cannot see why this movie made it to the big screen the story was old and has been shown in 100 other movies and 1000 tv series movies the main problem was basically nothing is happening take a kidnapping let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes you got your clearing movie the only 2 reasons i did not rate this a 1 was a dafoe and b the plan b ending there are not many endings you can give a kidnapper movie 75 of these kind end with ending a 20 end ending b and 1 ends with something boring boring boring
<START> the sf premise isn't unique although it pretty much was back then but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world br br in part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation he knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses how does he deal with this knowledge he knows that there is a world that is more real than his but he is trapped in an artificial world a world where nobody can understand him the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with for me the film transports this hopelessness very well with its dreary artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world br br other than 'the matrix' or 'the thirteenth it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world br br arguably it is longer than it has to be which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was and part 2 runs pretty low on steam
<START> i no words no words can describe this i will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their toasters after watching this show br br this cosgrove person her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly agitated insects perhaps i exaggerate however i have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show br br the characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets i have no doubt that it will happen eventually br br the main plot of this loudly into the faces of the actors is that of a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly web cast on the creatively titled com with her brainless friends one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn't afford her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother br br i haven't watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer or perhaps a cold but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator the doorman of the apartment almost dieing and the world's priest coming for a visit no really br br avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma if you do decide to watch it laugh when the laugh track tells you to as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long br br the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production but it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved how the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen lets see what they do with horton hears a who i hope this one does dr seuss some justice
<START> this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen however it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious i like to compare it to plan 9 in that it can be so bad so awful so dumb and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud br br one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn and robin hood men in tights but let's face it from the forbidden love between peck who is definitely slumming it although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a mockingbird and the female character who is so forgettable apparently that i have forgotten her name to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams robin hood all over it br br however i don't think the film isn't worth seeing on the contrary i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years even if it was unintentional
<START> a really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time and our equally valuable leisure time by bothering to support this utterly predictable and plainly formulaic piece of commercial junk the movie is based upon a really good and very topical idea but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard hollywood movie' formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production br br an unusually high tide and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a record high storm surge that overwhelms london and floods most of the thames valley the plot centers around a heroic scientist tom who alerts the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an embattled deputy prime minister david suchet who tries to look important br br but it's all so unreal that one feels like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes the young glamorous female police commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared state of emergency and gets it as if the experienced general is just pushed aside like a complete moron who has to lick her boots because of her obviously superior capacity the trouble is that our female supremo whilst now responsible for millions of lives spends most of her time worrying over the fate of her two daughters who have taken a trip to south west london and haven't to say they were alright so our mighty woman sets her staff to look for them and decides that the sole priority for all the army and the rescue services must be south west london and not any other quarter of the city of course the minister the army and the entire entourage accept her without question one can only assume they all had property there when her children are eventually found after endless reports and efforts by her staff she is told by our male hero 'thank god they're safe that's the main thing' never mind about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she was supposed to control as long as her own kids were safe everything was alright br br this film is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist clap trap that women are the clever mindful caring and clearly able leaders whilst men are good for nothing except physical bravery mindless strength and very specialist knowledge and yet the one simple instruction that she could have given the populace namely to go to the nearest tall building and calmly go up to the 4th floor or above and await instructions when the waters was never given by this female super hero or indeed anyone else the whole problem was so simple to solve and yet millions of people apparently didn't think of simply going upstairs pathetic rubbish
<START> the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didn't warn you kind of like the button labeled don't push this br br segal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like 40 mercenary types and doesn't even blink when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesn't quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act rappers out of the movies who came up with idea anyway i'd lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels br br the only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin which again doesn't sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie he'd throw some signs down on her and probably saved segal's life or something
<START> honestly this may be the worst movie i've ever seen and i've seen spider baby and not of this earth heck i've even seen 200 motels having just discovered the freaks and geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb i didn't realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio br br this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state seriously br br watch this movie if you think will farrel is really really really funny if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius watch this movie but please don't breed
<START> have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made and then said to yourself wow that was not a good mix well that is how i felt after watching this film br br many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very very corny comedy its almost like watching mr rogers play a ruthless gangster very weird some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that br br there are some very good performances here as dean stockwell mercedes and alec baldwin are all excellent but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film br br jonathan demme has done some excellent work in films such as silence of the lambs and philadelphia but seems to be out of his element with this one
<START> i saw this before ho at the fantasia film festival in montreal everything about it is either tipping the hat to or completely ripping off tim burton i enjoyed it nonetheless even if it is extremely derivative what most impressed me was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe string budget the set design and the props were inventive and original although the script definitely was not
<START> especially considering i can count on one hand the romantic comedy films i have ever enjoyed br br minnie driver is very good as the heart transplant patient who has a mysterious connection to duchovny's recently deceased wife i can think of several awful films which have used this story line i think there was an lmn movie with jane seymour this film however is a keeper br br duchovny is sympathetic and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad the dog misses his deceased wife all of his friends want him to find a replacement and there is an amusing scene where he is on a blind date and driver is the waitress his date is horrible and he finds himself intrigued by minnie driver br br caroll o'connor is also good in one of his last roles as the curmudgeonly grandfather bonnie hunt and james belushi this is the only film i have liked him in round out the comedy aspect of the film br br this is a good film because the story works it is not overly romantic and does not insult the audience's intelligence highly recommended 9 10
