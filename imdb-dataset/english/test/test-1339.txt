<START> one of the best as being a fan of the civil war i was very pleased with the first installment of the north and south trilogy patrick swayze gives and extraordinary performance as well as james reed and leslie ann down in watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten the subjects of love passion grief shame harmony and cruelty come to life i was first introduced to this series when i was in the eighth grade being a young boy you would think that i wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap to be honest this story stole the hearts of every one in my class and this is just the first book i bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome i am 17 now and still enjoy the story characters subject and remember the times of the civil war as a movie director of the future i will always enjoy north and south book one
<START> i just watched it for the second time today and i must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it and eric is hotter than ever to often in the movies first nations people are seen as other than everyday people we are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people hey we are just like everyone else and this movie showed just that we hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice it is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that i cant wait till this comes out on dvd thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was
<START> we're living in sad times today in which it seems like every comedy movie and tv show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap crude or poor humor most people don't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy and these people desperately need to watch throw momma from the train i say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen from beginning to end the comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout don't be fooled by the murder plot the plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what's going to happen the story involves a young man danny devito who wants to get rid of his annoying grouchy mother anne ramsey nominated for an oscar in a role that was completely flawless in my opinion and does so by killing off billy crystal's wife whom crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel i don't want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film but all i can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh fast paced and genuinely a real treat to comedy lovers and the type of film you just do not see today br br 1 2 out of
<START> people get a clue i mean the writers dont have one so i would expect you to this show is such a pale imitation of the show that you can laugh at it and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects and is in b w fer chrissakes yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this drivel get hip kids if 98 degrees or brittany told you to watch it you would you know it just bypass them and tell all your friends you were 'in' with the before it became too cool
<START> i supposed i was actually expecting a bollywood remake of the fog from the title but this is actually more of a bollywood remake of i know what you did last summer with some elements of scream kind of sort of and not a very good one either apart from a couple very entertaining song dance numbers this is pretty terrible it's obviously got a decent budget yet it's wasted on reheated leftovers that weren't that tasty to begin with a young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win she thankfully doesn't look as creepy as her brother but she enters anyway and wins and of course the creepy guy comes after her and is killed after which comes a rousing game of hide the body of course the body disappears and no one seems to know why but someone knows and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers especially the celebratory dance number at the party for the girl who won the beauty contest it's highly colorful it's well done downright fun and utterly wasted in this terrible film i would much rather watch an old ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available for the most part which is a crime in itself but not as big of a crime as this film i took one for the team watching this one so take my advice don't bother 2 out of 10
<START> is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end while others will stop watching it within five minutes it is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles batman's gotham city look carefully at the streets buildings the police car chasing the criminals etc it is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as secretary and the actor playing assistant lover who do their best to sing albeit not very successfully br br the spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent blue box there is a real club with this name in vienna where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen bureau with the sweet picture of his assistant etc br br the humorous moments in the movie are many and include flat in the face type of humor such as farting in his assistant's face the prostitute charging extra for orgasm the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of montana etc br br a legendary film from the 80's especially for those interested in austrian or german speaking cinema
<START> i watched a movie called dark talon dated 1974 the credits to this movie are exactly the same as dark star so i'm going to presume it was an alternate title dark talon was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states the acting was lame the editing slipshod and overall stupid at the beginning there's an annoying 1970's trucking song called benson arizona that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombing places that are unstable the bombs are sentient and respond to people the obligatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew one of the crewmen goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever the movie i saw was done in under an hour and a half with commercials thrown in so i suspect that dark talon is an version of dark star br br the alien is an red beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on it was silly and unconvincing as an alien br br it's hard to believe that john carpenter had a hand in this his other movies were so much better
<START> if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's how can you not love those great chipmunks don't forget about the lines and songs years later i can still sing every word to every song the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today it's just pure fun and worth the rent even if your all grown up
<START> i agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull i found myself disliking the main character and the following actors actresses that came in the scenes the camera work was non pleasing itself random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and i turned the film off i will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with sense and sensibility emma becoming jane and pride and prejudice i've only a few others to watch besides these films but i believe they were done in great taste the music was kind of out of place with the film also reminding me of another show i had seen this year it was called hex and a show from bbc i came across it one night on the web i rather liked the first season but the second season was dry and pulling things out of thin air that should of stayed with the clouds i found the main male character who was henry in this film out of place perhaps i just do not like his way of speaking or his stature well i would not recommend this film to anyone unless they were going to have it muted and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era or the way homes were kept at the time again i will watch the 1999 version and hope it is a better and does jane austen some justice to her writing
<START> there were at least a half dozen silent film versions of shakespeare's the merchant of venice and there have been several television productions but no one has ever gotten around to making a big budget theatrical feature from the play until now given the nature of the play s most memorable character shylock the nasty jew it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm sure the main motivation for michael new film is to provide al pacino with a chance to shout bray brood mutter and be tormented all of which he is quite good at like richard iii the role of shylock is a scenery dream it is ridiculous to call shakespeare an anti semite since he never met a jew jews were banned from england from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad on some level jews might as well have been a mythological race to him but while shakespeare may not have been anti semitic his play certainly is pacino gives shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of yiddish unfortunately the result is a 16th century with the unmistakable diction and cadences of fozzie bear version begins with a crawl about the wretched of jews and then spot antonio jeremy irons spitting on shylock pacino who's really just standing around minding his own business will buy it when it comes out on dvd for sure sarge booker
<START> the wild life has an obvious resemblance to fast times at ridgemont high and the wild life comes up short br br br br some other stan wrote the above comment of course the wild life is no ridgemont ridgemont is the quintessential 80s however the wild life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place the little latino from scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful i got visa the colonel also makes an appearance lawsuit rip the colonel 1931 1997 br br this movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres btw it is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that it does very much have the feel of a cameron crowe movie only gave it a 5
<START> when fellini committed 8 1 2 to film many commented that it was the most personal vision ever to find its perfect expression when dante cast to the flames of his undying passion many were aghast at the honest brutality of his unrequited feelings for a younger woman when and a merry band of wickedly talented and filmmakers from the mecca of movie making insanity band together during the course of two chilly weeks in december 2000 many commented that nothing more sophmoric had ever been committed much less on film br br well to the doubters out there watch this original piece and find out why the id is both a charming and powerful thing and if that doesn't roll over and rub one out it's probably time you did so br br kudos on a great piece of art
<START> honestly this show warms my heart i watch it everyday on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before the characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter the are super fast talking witty girls that will truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious but serious enough for it to be completely addicting it's an hour long which is a major plus because you can't ever get enough gilmore even in one hour emily and richard gilmore are kicks parents grandparents they're you're average rich parents emily president of the dar and richard a well known lawyer and yale alumni st rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier of course mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and rory going to yale did not help her on that journey but believe me every episode she does get closer
<START> thank god that there are films out there that don't follow the same old hollywood crap formula i think the digital revolution and the dvd revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it i love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches it really was like taking a trip through the soul of america and that soul is disturbed and confused what really blew my mind was the way they used martin luther king's speeches about vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard i found myself choked up every time i heard his voice i've heard him speak before of course but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like i understood his message in a way i'd never thought about br br what can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be in fact there's no credits at all in the film you have to access them by selecting them in the features somehow that made me think a lot all in all i can't say enough about this dvd brilliant
<START> it became apparent in the first 25 mins of watching this that the writers really wanted to make a feature length film and they probably certainly enjoyed the whole process but then seemed to forget the fact that it needed a decent plot if the best they could do was have 3 of the dullest characters enter the real world and have 'all sorts of amusing then they should have left well alone i didn't laugh once and that whole adventures of baron munchausen time bandits thing going on in the middle was very very poor contrived and very loose it just seemed like a whistle stop tour of anything they thought work just to drag it out to a feature br br full of holes eg the royston vasey characters needed the writers to carry on writing in order to save them yet jeff managed to write himself into the sub story time filling william and mary and era if he could do this then why didn't they just carry on writing royston themselves duh and herr audition what was that for i mean what was the point he did it and we heard nothing else whatsoever about it br br my main point is that while i loved the series this was an ill thought out seemingly rushed project put it this way the plot was so poor that if we didn't already know the characters and as a fan i had a certain loyalty to carry on watching and we relied solely on the the story itself this would have fallen flat on its face at best it would have gone straight to video and at worst would never have been made in the first place or maybe that should be the other way round truly dreadful
