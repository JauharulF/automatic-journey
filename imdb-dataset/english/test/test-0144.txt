<START> please if you're thinking about renting this movie don't if you're thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips don't if i had my way nobody would even have to read this summary br br the acting despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic the director was probaly a sadist the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti social 7 year olds that eat paint chips for breakfast br br the problem with this movie is that it tries to be a movie like evil dead 2 do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies in that it's so bad it's funny but it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails so overwhelmingly to do so that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an to save itself br br i could go on for much much more detailing just how awful it really was but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it if you need me i'll be off trying to boil myself so that i might feel clean again
<START> oh why did it have to end like this laurel and hardy's last film from the crudely cranked up cuckoo theme with erroneous credit to hal roach to the closing nice mess i couldn't help it schtick this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves in between their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting asinine dialogue and half hearted slapstick people slate king of new york but chaplin's final bow out was nowhere near as as this br br what really hurts to someone who loves laurel and hardy is the appearance of the two comedians the video cover i'm holding shows them at their prime all boyish smiles and glowing skin with a blurb on the back that reads the photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film necessarily it doesn't even come close the actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve with ollie distressingly overweight this is not humorously or comically fat as he would normally appear but ill looking and on the verge of obesity he would be dead seven years after this film was made after a series of strokes stan meanwhile suffering a prostrate problem and looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically every time something bad happens to him such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table you fear for his life even ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed he would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965 it's upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths and it's distressing watching their deterioration both in health and in performance on screen when i and i'm sure almost everyone else likes to think of laurel and hardy i think of way out west busy bodies or our relations seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog end of their career is a blight on my happy memories of them br br the warning signs are clear right from the opening credits which list not only four writers but also someone to come up with the concept and a credit for gags so if monty collins was writing the gags then what were the other four writing and in that case why was monty collins paid a fee given that there's no evidence of a single gag in the whole film over 40 of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in when i saw the bat scene i wanted to curl up and die so great was its childish ineptitude yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed unable to speak english not only does this make the film disjointed but also it severely stan and ollie's reactions to their co stars flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing this totally belies the rumoured 2 million that was spent on it frankly it looks terrible and while a dvd release might clean up the picture the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their hal roach work br br stan and ollie's friends and antoine are charisma free bores who stand out greatly against laurel and hardy's outdated repertoire this is another major problem with the film in that none of the supporting characters are funny or keyed in to the boys' innocent mentality the dubbed harshness shown to l h you the fat one makes them stand out as isolated social misfits rather than loveable sub there is evidence of some darker political satire though duck soup this ain't and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic perhaps more relevant now than it ever was a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the american constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003 sadly however beyond an amusing scene where stan is elected the people this doesn't really go anywhere and this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges or is a laurel and hardy movie where rape is directly implied and stan threatens a man with a bottle only to accidentally glass someone in the face your idea of a good time after all the years of stan and ollie sharing a bed we also get a definite reference with stan accidentally kissing him ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust also worrying is the implication that stan and ollie's illegal immigrant friend antoine ends his life being eaten by a lion mind you i never thought i'd see a laurel and hardy movie where they were due to be hanged either the need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is with the american release the same version available on video hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it br br almost completely unwatchable this horrifically made relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of stan and ollie avoid at all costs
<START> this roscoe fatty arbuckle comedy is best remembered for featuring a young buster keaton fresh from splitting with his family's vaudeville act in his film debut buster gets quite a substantial part in this film and it's quite a funny one overall the butcher boy has lots of laughs and is an example of pure old fashioned slapstick done well though it would seem to come from the brief era of two reel comedies when filmmakers still imagined in one reel segments as a matter of course br br the first half of the film takes place in a general store with arbuckle as the the butcher boy of the title it's an excuse to mine the many possibilities for fast physical humor that a general store provides and arbuckle really shows himself to be a 300 pound acrobat demonstrating subtlety skill and grace in his performance of what might have been unremarkable slapstick routines that raise them to a different level a running gag has him flipping a large butcher knife casually so that it spins accurately into it's proper position stuck into the cutting board and i'm still stunned that arbuckle really seems to do it each time there's also a really nice gag that sees him leaning on his scale and confused as to why his cuts of meat weigh so much br br buster keaton is a boy who comes into to buy some molasses and performs deftly in a foot stuck to floor routine that follows apart from the odd and almost unsettling half smile his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him recognizable immediately as the buster we know he even has his eventually trademarked flattened hat here destroyed for the first time when filled of course with molasses br br the second half of the film moves into more situation based comedy and arbuckle and his rival al st john dress in drag to infiltrate fatty's girlfriend's boarding school a lot of the humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysteriously laugh inducing sight of these two odd fellows wearing drag and trying to be girls buster is in this segment too but mostly stands there in the occasional cutaway helping st john br br the ending of the butcher boy becomes a little emptily frenetic but on the whole and beyond its historical curiosity interest it's a well done comedy that gets just the knockabout laughs it is going for
<START> i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie that's the way of the world it's been about 30 years since i've seen this movie and i would like to see it again earth wind fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes it was unfortunate that this group didn't take off like their counterparts in the early 70's but as previously stated racial tension existed in the united states which prohibited exposure for the african american musical groups it is good to see that earth wind fire continuing their success i would like to add this movie to my collection someone please help me if possible thank you for your attention milton shaw
<START> honestly awful film bad editing awful lighting dire dialog and scrappy screenplay br br the lighting at is so bad there's moments you can't even see what's going on i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that didn't help br br they must have found the script in a bin the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low you can't even laugh at the br br the directing and editing are also terrible the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal br br there's not a lot else to say other than it's really bad and nothing like jean claude van damme's earlier work which you could enjoy br br avoid like the plaque frankly words fail me in condemning this film
<START> first of all let me say this film isn't for everyone it has a very strange subject matter a spinster living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her townhouse she notices him sitting out in the rain and invites him in to dry off warm up the man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute still she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him he finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn't mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him the woman i won't give away the rest of the plot if you can find this film watch it you cannot take your eyes off of it what makes it so interesting well it is totally unique i've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable especially when you find out what this bland boring obsessive spinster is capable of you won't forget it soon
<START> obsessed i have every season of gilmore girls and i think the reason i love it so much is because of how smart the script is its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on if you missed you missed it and its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks i think gilmore girls is one of the bests shows on t v shows of its time its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is br br and you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty to the hermit luke to the immature kirk the show is just amazing i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them there is only one word that can describe gilmore girls classic
<START> the late director john frankenheimer directed his first feature film the young stranger after starting out directing live television dramas in new york city this film came on the heels of the success of rebel without a cause in 1955 james macarthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father played by james daly who doesn't establish enough of a relationship with his son kim hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son the film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story macarthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by whit bissell macarthur in turn has to deal with a police sergeant james gregory bent on teaching him a lesson the material could easily have turned exploitative laughable and sensational like any number of others of the period did however under the sure handed direction of frankenheimer the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics the dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well some of the scenes with bissell as the theater manager and gregory as the police sergeant are a bit heavy handed and dated the performances are uniformly good though which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed this is an impressive feature film debut both for macarthur and frankenheimer of 4 stars
<START> to me this movie was just plain confusing slow and uninteresting why did the aliens choose to communicate through ants it makes no sense the ending was muddled and made no sense whatsoever in the end i was hoping that the ants would kill everyone br br avoid this one at all costs not even mst3k could save it
<START> i wish i would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before i rented it a waste of money a waste of time very little dialog the dialog was hard to understand in every way the storyline and plot were both weak the only thing that was nice at all was the cinematography br br the characters were interesting at the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out because of the lack of dialog that you will be rewinding the movie a lot br br do not watch this movie it was a mess and will leave you feeling like a mess br br you will say what the heck was that when the movie ends
<START> this was an interesting movie half comedy half political thriller it had a lot of good elements although it was a little predictable br br robin williams stars as tom dobbs a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political commentary think daily show with john stuart during the taping of one of his shows a female in the audience tells him he should run for president that followed by a few jokes taken seriously were all that was needed to get the ball rolling and start political career br br he runs independently and opposes democrats and republicans equally he is straightforward and honest and becomes increasingly popular but maybe not popular enough to actually win he's clearly the underdog in this election br br meanwhile a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much quicker and easier for the common people but there is a glitch the glitch is discovered by a young lady named elanor who is appeased by the software developer with a lie that he fixed the glitch before the upcoming election br br election day comes around and lo and behold dobbs is declared the winner big surprise elanor knows that he is not really the president he didn't win legitimately she decides to tell the president but complications arise her company went as far as poisoning her in order to silence her in addition to that she quickly takes a liking to dobbs br br the plot takes a few twists and turns before reaching it's slightly predictable conclusion but it never got boring robin was great as usual and christopher walken often stole the show as manager turned political adviser and best friend br br it's an entertaining film and it has a good message i recommend it if you're in the mood for dark satire or something that makes you think overall i give it a 7 10
<START> i have been waiting to see this film for ages and i finally have as soon as i heard the title i knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when i saw it believe me i wasn't disappointed br br this film had everything dance love and patrick swayze there was so much in it and it dealt with important issues that were at the time 1960's such as abortion br br the dancing in this film was fantastic just like the acting was swayze was brilliant just like grey was too br br although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene it really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing br br overall dirty dancing is a film not to be missed and even if half the actors are in the where are they now period the actors will always have this superb film in their career
<START> there's only so much that i can take of filipino films especially nowadays where the trend is sex action and slapstick comedy which i hate the fact that ka man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus it's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great especially the cinematography i think that claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie milan the fact that there's only so few filipino movies that i really like i think laurel did such a great job in this movie i truly truly loved this movie technically and character development wise the plot was complex and that's what made it terrific
<START> i had great expectations surrounding this movie not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1 2 but high enough and when i saw it on cable they were all shattered starting by the acting poor almost mediocre an astonishing waste of good actors and talent and the story itself since when does a 5 men squad go out on patrol on a supposed zone to suicide thatÂ´s one big mistake that costs the film dearly very good actors do very poor acting here like sean penn that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on am and michael j fox that wastes a good opportunity to beat charlie sheen on performing just but the most irritating character was diaz played by john leguizamo another stupid waste of fine talent by the director that was a cheesy scared and insecure kind of person even more irritating that jar jar binks yes you heard it the battle sequences are average the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence with michael j fox trapped by his feet on a vc tunnel mr de palma has a weak work here and if it wasnÂ´t for films like and Â«the these ones excellent films i would consider him a director too much publicity bad filming br br 3 10
<START> i read all of the other comments which made this movie out to be an excellent movie i saw nothing of the excellence that was stated i thought it was long and boring i tried twice to watch it the first time i fell asleep and the second time i made it to within six minutes of the end and gave up i suppose that it was mainly my fault going in with great expectation but i don't think that this would have completely ruined the movie for me the movie was just bland it had nothing that was spectacular or unique to it the plot was not half bad the action sequences were non existent the dialogue forced and the movie just went on forever i would not recommend seeing this movie
