<START> if you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and unchecked government can do to un popular people this movie provides it read what some people are saying about the patriot act passed after 9 11 and then watch this movie is it worth it do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people regardless of what you saw on tv you are not fully informed until you watch this movie i apologize for quoting another reviewer but it needs repeating roger ebert of siskel ebert said what's interesting is if you're looking for people who are unbalanced zealots you don't find them among the branch davidians you find them among the fbi and the alcohol tobacco and firearms those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared i think i think every person responsible for 9 11 needs to be brought to justice but i think the government has not shown a history of honoring it's duty to protect people's rights and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion
<START> i'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when i saw this movie in a 5 bin i figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection while i never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing br br the premise has enough potential a penguin named finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea he then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home that set up isn't great but it's enough to set up what could be a fun adventure unfortunately the duo's exploits never really amount to much and it all gets pretty repetitive most of the situations they find themselves in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity and the bonding the two of them under go is cheesy and forced br br animation is good but not up to don bluth's usual standards this is the guy that gave us the secret of nimh land before time and an american tale all of which had an attention to detail that often surpassed disney the granddaddy of feature animation this one doesn't amount to much beyond high end tv fair br br the music is alright but pretty forgettable and the voice actors are all wasted talent martin short is particularly wasted here as the lead character who in spite of being spoken of as a is practically a straight man through the whole film br br in short the movie will probably appeal to very small kids but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it doesn't got what it takes
<START> most people get the luxury of typing in the title of a film and finding out about the film before watching it but unfortunately i've just never been one of those kind of people i wouldn't even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers but there are two sides to that because if you ignore such warnings and even give a film a chance after it has flopped in theatres you're entering at your own risk and might just end up with a bad taste in your mouth which is exactly how i feel about this stupid movie br br honestly the only thing good about crap crap are some of it songs and seriously excluding the title track even the ever promising talent metro gangster is seriously wasted here as she plays the woman who has captured the attention of both the leading male characters played by bobby deol who plays a j a rootless music producer and patel who plays an upcoming artist who crosses a j 's path celina jaitley provides the right amount of oomph required of a socialite who gets jilted by whom she helped get his foot in the record industry's door this doesn't sound like a mix or movie that should include anupam kher right well you're wrong because he's in it as father another wasted talent br br the film might not have been so bad had their not over killed the writing behind deol's character the moral message was too preachy revenge had a deadly dark side and the ending was way too overblown that it will make you wonder why you sat down to such a foolish movie in the first place truly this is the epitome of crap
<START> naturally in a film who's main themes are of mortality nostalgia and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones however there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy the pace is steady and constant the characters full and engaging the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion screams to show fear shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger naturally joyce's short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond but the small changes huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly it is truly a masterpiece of tact subtlety and overwhelming beauty
<START> for some reason i always enjoy movies that people hate when i really don't think they're that bad and this is one of those films in the case of this movie i think it is way too over criticized i really isn't that bad of a film at all in fact i think this is one of the better sequels halloween the curse of michael myers begins on the night before halloween where michael brutally murders jamie lloyd who was taken captive by the man in black in part 5 after she gives birth to his baby we are then introduced to the strode family who is now coincidentally living in the old myers house which seems to change in each film kara and her son danny are the main characters along with tommy doyle the now adult boy who survived the original killings they must fight together to save jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of michael while michael himself is driven to kill by an old celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in haddonfield br br this is surely one of the best sequels in the series in my opinion anyway and i can't understand all of the hate it has gotten it had some nice suspense an interesting plot but sometimes confusing i'll admit some scary moments here and there and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds not all of the acting wasn't particularly great but it was convincing enough for me marianne hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable paul rudd plays a grown up tommy doyle and is also very talented and plays his part nicely the rest of the supporting cast besides the brilliant donald pleasance isn't much to praise but it wasn't too bad either all things considered i'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why michael kills was completely necessary but it turned out to be okay in the end and i wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together the open ended conclusion was also kind of eerie but could have been something more br br i have also seen the infamous producer's cut of this film the original cut of it and i think that in some respects it is better it further explains the thorn curse that drives michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion it felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film i wish that dimension would release this alternate version of the film because i personally think it is better the chances of that are very slim though br br overall halloween the curse of michael myers is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series this movie isn't the best of all horror movies but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see michael do his thing just don't expect brilliance and you'll enjoy it 7 10
<START> milos forman's original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years not only in the usa but especially in this country one of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after hair for example in american etc it was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it the characters in the film were like lonely cells in a body that was changing all over overall a very good film perhaps a little underrated though annie role was minor but she acted very well it was the film that practically launched john savage as an actor one of the members of the chicago played his role well even though it was a minor role
<START> no no no no no no no this is not a film this is an excuse to show people dancing this is just not good even the dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre 'dirty dancing' let alone any other good dance movie br br is it a love story is it a musical is it a drama is it a comedy it's not that this movie is a bit of all it's that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be the film turns out to be even more meaningless as the film progresses br br acting is terrible from all sides the screenplay is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship but fails miserably br br watch for the moment when patrick stewart enters the scene and you think the film might get better as he brightens up the dull atmosphere for a second
<START> in luchino visconti's film death in venice it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays but in the pursuit of beauty itself gustav von decays into a mere shell of a man to understand the decay we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us it is best described and explained in a quote from socrates found in thomas mann's version of death in venice beauty alone is lovely and visible at it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our else the divine if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses should we not perish and become consumed by love we see in the film this very thing happen the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty which turns into a longing for the boy even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon he cannot contain himself br br it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film early on we see the extravagance of the parlor and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turn of the century upper class life all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer pasqualino de santis but visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of venice instead the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty and these things are relegated to the past the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff the streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot the city decays in step with the protagonist only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man the death of his daughter and presumably his wife along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself br br alfred with whom has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it but alfred is more than a friend he is alter ego and what alfred says the composer's own doubts and fears the scene in which decides to leave venice is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling him that he is weak alienated and lacks feelings in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all it is a decay of memory rather than objective renderings of the past these flashbacks become distorted memories we can say that these are decayed memories because even alludes to it he declares reality distracts and degrades us and following the scene in the travel agent's office we see confront and his family and warn them leave venice but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of gustav he allows the viewer's mind to wander as we watch life and respectability decay with the beauty around him br br slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth the crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man's attraction to it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed even in fantasy the beauty of this polish boy a fire in him that at first makes him glow then consumes him the film concludes with von sitting feebly in a beach chair watching fight with his friend we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood it is a vision of his life's moments though before his last breath the final decay has happened all around him the city is soiled and with it he has become what he detests as dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film a man that had disturbed him it was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise and that of the city around him his sensuality is indulged in while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in venice together beauty death and decay these themes are visconti's art the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself br br in this film we are treated to the of one great man we see the honored composer gustav von in the pursuit of true and pure beauty and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable lonely death watching the target of his affection i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last decay is intrinsic in the world around us and when we become distracted it can destroy the splendor in death in venice it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted beauty and are woven together like thorns in visconti's works at once beautiful and destructive it is these themes that define his art
<START> i've seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it the quirkier and funnier it becomes perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas cage's character's persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film nonetheless it's a cute love story with extremely funny unique characters i think it's right up there with fast times and weird science quintessential eighties flicks
<START> two things too long and totally lacked credibility this movie didn't make any sense and was to sit through i am usually pretty patient but man it just doesn't keep your attention at all i think i am being nice here even you keep thinking it's almost over only to find out it's still got another half hour good actors
<START> who gave these people money to make a movie there was nothing funny about it the fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this piece of sickness says it all first of all it has nothing to do with christmas it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the chevy chase original they took randy 'i have no talent i m just a fat and sweaty quaid the only wrong thing about part 1 and made a 'movie' about him there are only morons in his family but not the 'aren't they cute' kinda moronic but the 'don t touch me' kinda moronic watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone who takes part in it dies they didn't even bother to get the effects in order when they re on the boat the only thing that moves is the fake background when pigface quaid is in the water you can tell by the lighting that it's in a studio this movie was sexist uncle nick racist uncle nick and should never have been made never throwing the money into a volcano would have had so much more use br br well i hope i reached some of you nobody warned me and now i m scarred for life merry f cking christmas
<START> within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing well actually the soundtrack shows that the best i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting well if i saw any i would gladly let you know the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep i will give the person one 10 10 and that was for the dvd cover because if i actually saw before watching this in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i wouldn't ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is wow if this was the best i wouldn't want to know what the crap in the film festival was like br br films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there
<START> i watched this with great trepidation and my trepidation was well founded it seems what was this movie about knight the season the players what it was all over the place all the time it had no tension sorry we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things but brian a fine actor comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension cheaply shot like a episode contrast this thanksgiving main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie only in america to show how to do sports biopics warts and all notice that espn promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again
<START> in spain the former sailor ramÃ³n javier bardem has been for twenty eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend clara ramÃ³n is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause julia belÃ©n who has a degenerative fatal disease and meets rosa lola a lonely worker that has been abused by men their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of rosa and julia br br the chilean alejandro amenÃ¡bar is in my opinion one of the best contemporary directors his filmography released in brazil is composed by excellent and original movies abre los ojos tesis the others and mar javier bardem is probably the best actor in spain in the present days their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme the right of committing euthanasia this drama is never corny or depressive since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations the performances of the cast are perfect with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme the dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent i noted in imdb plot outline that this movie is based on the real life story of ramÃ³n unfortunately neither the movie nor the dvd gives this important information my vote is nine br br title brazil mar sea inside
<START> this movie moved me more than i was expecting and i was fully prepared to cry the acting mainly carried this film with superb performances from jude law nicole kidman and renee zellweger as well as the supporting cast these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me and i had trouble shaking this war drama the costumes and cinematography were also magical but didn't get carried away with themselves they didn't take focus but added to the whole effect cold mountain could never become my favorite movie as that title will always belong to the english patient but it's in the top five the story itself was well developed and stayed fairly unpredictable i did not find myself guessing what line came next a heart wrenching story about humanity and war in fact this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century it seemed to apply to all times
