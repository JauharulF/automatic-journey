<START> ok so by minute 15 in the film there's still no dialogue br br this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under with encrypted info on the front i am a programmer from a north american fest and mod love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having at the far away moscow vary interface br br straight away i thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute 15 but kept watching anyway well well well it built and built and built and half way in i was involved in this film because like when you go to the zoo at first you're reticent but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit you're totally 'there' br br this film has a not at all like the much hyped wolf creek but because it is so totally 'other' in every way shape and form and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first time ie gloomy weather red neck intrigue odd splicing eerie music and a plot which though imperfect and basic has a bit in common with one of the 'great aussie movies' ie the cars that ate paris by but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of ocker and playful self deprecation that pervades many of that country's films it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start no cell phones no brand names no i pods no gritty urban middle class angst just a dude married to a good looker an old volvo and a little boy son who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around oh and it's set in weird sea side village where people all look slightly 'wrong ' photographed by nick matthews 2 37 and music by tom ten canoes mod luv succeeds where many movies fail ie it stands up without regard to the god forsaken country that it comes out of instead it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve and herein lies the weak link what on earth does this film have to do with modern love the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer or at least hints at one and as i sat and drank a coffee and ate my hershey's afterwards all that i could surmise was that this film's helmer alex will prob have a lot of fun with this one
<START> danger watch for falling spoilers br br boy was this a bad movie i know that they were going for a true love conquers all kind of thing but about all this film conquered was about 3 which felt more like 9 hours of my afternoon which i will never get back the movie is about two young lovers named kai and who live in a remote town in a fantasy world kai is the much abused bellboy at a hotel owned by father at first ignores advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of you guessed it father as if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in eye and he becomes a mean person treats poorly kai is eventually taken to the snow queen's fortress which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice because the good people at hallmark like to go all out and sets out on a mission to get kai back along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way but escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way all the while you will want to turn it off but can't force yourself to do it it's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen anyways i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it so in conclusion the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie which takes the fan out of fantasy
<START> this is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there john carpenter as made a tour de force horror epic with outstanding special effects great performances from kurt russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you for ever the greatest thing about this movie after 17 years is it dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this back in 1982 this was up against e t and of course it and was a box office bomb over the years the thing as made a cult following from video and t v sales and as many new fans in the end this movie kicks ass and to me it as never loss it's edge to scare the pants off of you and to me that a horror movie long live john carpenter
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film which in many ways as hitchcock did on several occasions was a first attempt at a plot which he re shot later in his career possibly the most amazing thing about it however is how faceless the lead characters are after watching one remembers murray as the jovial truck driver vaughan touching turn as a blind patriot the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive compare that bridge jump to harrison ford's similar stunt in andrew davis' the fugitive and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believable br br the other major support player is of course hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects my feelings are that with lack of technology to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement br br obviously this film carries an anti fascist message made at the time of the second world war but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action well worth checking out especially for the support roles
<START> a surprisingly beautiful movie beautifully conceived beautifully directed beautifully acted beautifully acted and most beautifully photographed the cinematography is nothing short of splendid it is a war movie but is epic in it's scope and blends romance tragedy and comedy into a story that is as harrowing as it is provoking
<START> i don't normally write reviews but this film was special i couldn't turn it off i don't believe i've ever seen a worse movie but there i sat watching it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway it was disgusting but i couldn't turn away where do i start the movie seems to think it's a sports thriller but it's so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but it's not funny not even in a dumb silly way it's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get it's painful to watch but at least it's only for a minute or two second string went on for over an hour br br whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again the writing directing acting and everything was just terrible the problem is i can't describe how bad it was you just had to see it and i'm sure this will never be shown again so unless you saw it you're out of luck i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film i've seen over my lifetime and for every film i see in the future that i can't stand i will think to myself well at least it wasn't bad as the second string
<START> give me a break how can anyone say that this is a good hockey movie i know that movies tend to do a pretty p poor job of portraying hockey to the general public and yes this was made back when the u s hadn't embraced our sport to the extent is has today but really i have played hockey all my life and have watched even more and this my friends is sheer lunacy the scenes on the ice were stupefyingly bizzare the particular instance to which i am referring is the sword fight er i mean the stick fight at the end of the film during which everyone is just standing around and watching not with fascination that this is actually happening but in wonder as to who will win the duel between youngblood and his nemesis yes the story off the ice is a little better i do stress little br br i don't know maybe there is no point in going on i mean let's face it the film is right hockey is just one big battle on ice oh yeah with a little piece of rubber bouncing around occasionally into what is loosely termed a goal youngblood is either appalling or hysterical i can't figure out which maybe someone else will have more luck
<START> a wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller to me the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one and they should have gone for an all out comedy for example rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy the scene where betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy an even better example is the hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through freeman's character early on about the plight of the indians i mean yawn they should have given freeman something funny to say in that segment but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring pc speech br br there is yet more new age pc ness in the form of the ending the girl not only doesn't get the boy she gets no boy at all in fact the message is that the girl needs no boy at all bit of a feminist statement there the first half hour is weak but the movie gets better ironically once zellweger gets to kinnear i say ironically because i'm not much of a fan of kinnear's though he's solid here zellweger is very cute as usual she has the sort of all american cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy and i have to wonder why more of such women aren't represented nowadays instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars such as diaz roberts aniston lopez or barrymore br br since the movie tries to be very serious at times i have no choice but to criticize freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker with the heart of gold there is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son
<START> excellent entry in the rko saint series with well written original script good camera work and transitions good directing to handle some twists in the plot good editing to keep the flow constant and good acting george sanders is suave and witty jonathan hale simply is inspector fernack paul plays a mobster who goes straight and drinks milk because he cannot take the pressure he will return in a later entry in the series story begins on an ocean liner headed to the u s where the saint meets but cannot connect with barrie she eventually succumbs to the charms but she breaks his heart in the end the saint assists inspector fernack clear his name from a frame a few bodies fall along the way good entertainment and above average for this type of film watch it
<START> i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear this movie is awful beyond awful in fact so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is skeleton man in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible sure loads of people are getting killed by this skeleton puppet wearing a ridiculous cape but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is where he comes from or why he's so angry with the world he looks like a crossover between skeletor from masters of the universe and the horseman from sleepy hollow and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness the setting of skeleton man is another totally retarded aspect for nearly half an hour i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods huh why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes anyway after a couple of totally random killings a special commando squad led by poor washed up michael rooker arrives to come and hunt a monster they don't know anything about really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him herself as the expert in a certain field we have a sniper specialist a tracking genius a drill instructor yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills the horror gods must really hate casper van dien as he's present again as well portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason crashes on the highway but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there right that makes sense furthermore the characters steal cool one liners from predator the horse constantly changes colors helicopters are brought down with bow arrows ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael rooker i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top 100 asap
<START> i saw this film for the first time last night i have been thinking about it all night and this morning i cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet i need to see it again br br the cinematography is stunning each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has wim wenders's name attached to it br br it is always tempting to see de in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits in many ways the figure of malkovich walking through the fog and wind of echoes the shadow of the off canvas statue that haunts milan in the major works of the italo greek painter he is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story br br the dedicated wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of and wandering through the streets of berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants and following the himmel uber berlin metaphor the angel or in this case malkovich the director gets to interact with one of the stories br br at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far i need to see the movie again i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring monologue together br br perhaps his musings and are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication maybe that is the whole point of it no one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework br br we must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious it is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal when we shun all discussions of philosophy god existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death perhaps this is the warning that wenders and antonioni are giving us it certainly is not the only theme of the film but i think that it cannot be ignored br br the other and most obvious leitmotif is that of satisfaction there is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review br br my advice is to see the film but i offer a caveat it is not an autonomous film at least i don't think so yet some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film par les is one of those films
<START> i still wonder why i sat through this entire thing it only had about 3 minutes of actual entertainment the rest of it was just a total bore the acting isn't that great and the action scenes are soooo cheesy it's not even funny i kinda wish i could say something good about this film but i can't think of anything right now there probably was somethings in it some can enjoy but the ending of it is gotta be the dumbest idea ever what type of person would get a little toy remote controlled helicopter with a burned in machine gun in it to assassinate the president this idea could have never been done in the first place let alone have anyone dumb enough to try it i guess the writer must have been to obsessed with the toy car scene in the dead pool but actually tried to make this look serious
<START> storyline drags drug smugglers a beautiful women and a determined cop nothing not already done a hundred times before the boat will be well worth the wait amsterdam is the perfect city to pull it off the canals and put you on the edge of your seat i would say the same as did the car chase in bullitt very intense
<START> an excellent thoughtfully produced historical drama well played artfully written shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo and with more than a few moving moments especially for those who care about the history of africa and imperialism however a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation and because names and so forth are hard to follow so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted and the subsequent history before enjoying the film if you have the dvd version there is also some useful historical background there is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an american accent is actually beeped out a simple google search of film censor or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating and perhaps disturbing twist regarding the production of this important film this film if coupled with a little outside research helps dozens of other films relating to central east africa and or imperialism e g hotel rwanda shake hands with the devil various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness and even ali when mohammed ali visits
<START> try as i might i just simply couldn't get into this one perhaps it was the washed out tones perhaps it was the drawn out approach i'm not really sure but though this was by no means a bad movie i didn't really find it to be very much of an effective movie words that i understand are so much more arbitrary than their common uses br br so basically the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys' deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town triggering a witch hunt what do the boys' death have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who has appeared in town is the crazy hermit woman involved is it voodoo the story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensues br br good enough but to me most of it fell a little flat oh it had it's moments the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter commentary even if the effects themselves failed considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with red hot irons br br my biggest issue was the ending i've already put spoiler tags on this review but be warned here's the big spoiler i don't believe it i don't believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier with other boys with a history or some other personal affect the movie didn't really earn its ending end spoilers br br nonetheless fulci is a big name and i'm more than certain there's an audience out there for this i definitely need to check out more that he's done because this may have been a poor introduction most italian giallo is hit or miss anyway so i'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him off br br polarisdib
