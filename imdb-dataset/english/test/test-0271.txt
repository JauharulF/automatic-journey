<START> this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face i'm a christian and liked the film in one way it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see it can be a bit long winded but the film has some quite nice cars that rescues it from a lower rating from me as a christian film it was quite good but maybe a bit right on in the message the film works best on a big screen spoilers the fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the christian thriller mercy streets starring eric roberts end of spoiler i give it a 7 10
<START> it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this 1933 release although sound came into general use in 1928 there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story br br hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim br br the swimming scene is very brief discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film artfully so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece br br not so it's disappointing primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn't br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note
<START> the episode begins with scenes of a dead woman washed up on the shore a forlorn jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery yep this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end jim does well to unravel what is a priori an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home to be sure the eventual explanation is a little far fetched why for example go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her and her companions out would've been as easy and left less of a trail however these niggles aside it's a memorable episode full of invention even if yet again jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious police dept i mean to say have the ungrateful so and so's ever sat down and counted just how many of their files have been solved by dear ol' jimbo
<START> wow this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now to say this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love br br when i saw name in the tv guide i figured it would be a spoof maybe it should have been could have made for a better movie br br look for the scene where they are in an airplane in mid flight with the door open and there is no wind what so ever they could have sprung for a fan at least br br look for several canadian c list actors in the movie this is the kind of movie that litters the b rate cable stations you never watch except on a rainy sunday
<START> ok if i was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks for the rental i'd have to say no the plot was implausible i've come to the conclusion that keanu reeves can not act he can at times be painful to watch though my wife thinks he's cute dan aykroyd who is usually great was even a little disappointing as the crooked cop on the plus side the plot because it is far fetched is unpredictable cameron diaz was good
<START> i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like i am ever going to get bored of it i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the tv together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on tv br br this film is perfect even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters the dance the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song all you need is love actually has some kind of a meaning br br i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time we'll be able to see dirty dancing
<START> one cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunities br br i found the script to be excellent and the vocal talent of edmund purdom quite impressive however as an artifact of its time the film suffers from too many hollywood isms especially poor casting too much lushness of the sets and too much pretentiousness edmund purdom who plays the title character is so obviously awkward with physical acting i suspect he had primarily been in shakespearean theater before this br br so if movie people are reading this i propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake especially if you cast real egyptians as egyptians
<START> closet land was sponsored by amnesty international and does have a lot of political overtones but there's so much more to this richly stirring story than that br br this is not just about the political tension of the late 80s it's about the personal persecution that a woman puts herself through as a child who was molested by a family friend we see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest government society structure and the culture of sexual predation where one in four young children are molested and one in three women has experienced some form of rape br br for me it brings up a chilling chicken and egg question does the attitude of our sexual repression leading to predation create the political environment of fear and censoring or does the socio political dysfunction fuel a culture of sexual predation the psychological ramifications of even asking this question force us to a place where we are brought to develop our own answers br br in the end our young lady writer stowe has a similar moment to the one at the end of labyrinth she realizes in one shining brilliant moment that the idea of having her power stolen from her by the secret police rickman is an illusion no one can steal your power they can only trick you into giving it up and then you have the right to take it back at any time br br this is not a movie to be entered into lightly and you most certainly do enter it the minimalist aspects coupled with the child like animation stirs the deepest parts of the psyche and leaves no viewer unchanged
<START> it's very easy to figure out why the new professionals was a dud at least in new zealand it didn't just follow in the footsteps of the original it followed bodyguards which out the show considerably with its boss and two agents formula cmdr mcintyre was a latter day george cowley tough on his team but one who would defend them to the death against others the shadow the show cast was huge br br well not as huge as it should have been in the uk here it was networked in prime time it was even marketed in the promos as 'they are the professionals ' someone else obviously noticed the difference we were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different regions at different time slots br br it was the high production values that sealed the deal for me as other reviewers have noted it followed the great british tradition of the one hour actioner but blended in personal elements at the same time there's a slight undercurrent of something developing between liz and ian though that never distracted one from the real plot most episodes were based around inflammatory diplomatic incidents the sort of thing that helps spooks along from time to time br br unlike many 2000s shows the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy pants photography or over stylish direction directors like christopher young kept the pace up and did their job they made use of good locations making bodyguards slicker than if it had been shot on back roads and alleyways it was contemporary it would still stand up beautifully today and it was one of the better examples of the british actioner in the 1990s showing that the uk can still do them better than anyone else br br maybe except for the germans and their cobra 11
<START> 1979's tourist trap is a clever unique b thriller that stands out as one of the best of it's kind br br travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner's mannequins are a little too life like for comfort br br while the film has hints of the texas chainsaw massacre tourist trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of the twilight zone director david schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery that reaches nightmarish proportions also adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings br br actor chuck connors is the best of the film's decent cast pino music score is excellent having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie a number of the film's sequences are quite memorable br br for horror and thriller fans alike tourist trap is an unforgettable must see film br br 1 2 out of
<START> the falcon and the snowman is a superb example of an anti 80s film while many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance there's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it it boasts two superb performances timothy hutton and sean penn as lifelong friends christopher boyce and lee respectively hutton penn and tom cruise were a of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things all 3 starred in taps while penn and cruise's popularity soared hutton has been largely forgotten about and that's a shame actually hutton is the first of the 3 to win an oscar for supporting role in ordinary people in 1980 but i think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding br br hutton really captures the post vietnam war rebelliousness in his character chris boyce a failed seminary school student chris has a love hate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor pat hingle the scene where chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one br br chris gets job at dept of defense and uses his hatred of u s gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the soviets he gets his buddy a hyper drug dealing self server in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm while chris is doing it based on his beliefs is doing it strictly for the money the soviet liaison is excellently played by david suchet penn and suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them but make no mistake this film is anything but that it is a serious character study about pessimism malaise paranoia and mistrust br br again the leads make this film hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesn't think at all the ending of this fact based film is very saddening on several levels a truly powerful character study
<START> i'm usually a fan of art and foreign films but when i saw this one my reaction was it must be called experimental because it makes no sense the action is static while at the same time it bounces from one location to another there aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man
<START> this very loose retelling of carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering sexually frank dance between prisoner and her female prison warden but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film one minute is all sexual predator the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas although the film deserves kudos for the first bisexual the broad strokes it paints are so vignette like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic undisciplined melange of basic instinct meets bound meets an african version of a bollywood musical
<START> tediously long dreary cinematic waffle i couldn't believe how bad this film was i watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site was i watching the same film the entire episode is one dimensional nothing that happened in past affected his or anyone else's future and no one was affected by their past i think it was socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect then it shouldn't be there obviously the director didn't know this rule and so stuffed his 'work' with one dire scene after another even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected it wasn't a surprise but it was unexpected br br it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this 1st dec 2002 even though many people say it is one of their favourite films no one has bothered to add a memorable quote the reason being that there simply aren't any br br don't waste your time watching this watch a plank warp instead
<START> what a gargantuan pile of ye gods where to even begin with this oneÂ br br well mix crap acting including one bloody infuriating woman who speaks as though she's either a chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b has just woken up after having undergone some extensive root canal surgery editing that would appear to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced via the of an angle grinder some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts 'action' a script that has ostensibly been written by a two year old and some of the most hideous and intrusively loud background music ever committed to any film and hey presto you have death machines aka the ninja murders although note that surprise surprise Â there are in fact no actual ninja anywhere to be found in this sodding travesty br br in a nutshell if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement bout of then this must surely be it avoid at all costs
