<START> this movie brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a d d group while watching i could not help but notice how vividly characters reminded me of myself and my gaming friends to the point where they acted literally the same as we do including the bickering the fighting the internal jokes driving the dm crazy everything br br it has it all jokes that made me cry action scenes which even filmed in low budget i found uncannily awesome the story is pretty straightforward and unsurprising but that doesn't really matter since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the br br seriously if you're playing d d or any similar rpg i cannot stress this enough watch this movie it captured beautifully the spirit of d d
<START> after watching this movie i couldn't help but notice the parallels between it and another film called america 3000 both were very bad mid 1980's post apocalypse disasters on celluloid obviously fake sets wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films about the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here played by has a very thick accent avoid this one unless you're watching the mst3k version joel and the bots barely salvage this turkey
<START> one of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice the final sequence with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted committed and his own execution are just superb br br no what about the work of sean penn and susan sarandon it leaves you breathless they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion br br tim robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor he's a nice director as well br br my rate 9 10
<START> my wife and i saw this when we were 17 the only good thing my father ever did get us in this is our movie and the music is our songs michelle's song is our song yeah nowadays it's a crime to show naked children on the screen but we were screwing at 16 why not these kids the movie is rich boy impregnates poor girl then rich dad steals him away from her at the end after she gives birth under impoverished conditions she is left alone with child it is a love story and a growing up story the music is fantastic and the story is one any person could relate to may be someday this will be released on dvd
<START> i thought this movie was really good it ends up showing the viewers in the end that leila should of kept what she had leila was sick of her husband jim who was more worried about work then her he was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary he was also very sloppy she couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her the movie shows that he misses her he even tries to make up for the night he messed up he goes to her and tries to bring her home she ends up finding another man named he seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her in the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way jim did the same kinda thing jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing
<START> one dark night is a highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80's that deserves an audience that i fear it will never get and that's a damn shame i have seen this film compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the years most notably phantasm hell night and mausoleum this is a much different film than those and i don't see the comparisons other than the mausoleum which is a bit similar to the one in phantasm but not enough to make any real comparisons i'm not sure how this one slipped through without a broader acceptance maybe it's all in the marketing i don't know perhaps a remake would breathe new life into it unless drained all the life out of it that is i'm not too big on all the remakes that are abundant these days but i think they do work well with lesser known films except for the awful ghost ship remake which other than the opening scene and not falling blaring was utter crap so if a remake of one dark night would happen to fall into the right hands i think it would make a lot of people go and watch the original i know that's what i do if there's a remake of a film i haven't seen before so anything short of a remake i fear would not bring this film back to life unless of course got his eyes on it br br anyways one dark night is a must see for horror fans especially 80's horror fans 'cause we all know that's when the best horror movies were made creepy setting fairly good acting very good story campy what more could you want from an early 80's horror film what's that nudity and gore well sorry no nudity or gore in this film but it's still great nonetheless a solid 8 out of 10 enjoy
<START> gary cooper is a cool headed guy always liked his easy going level headed characters as some others have commented there are some oddities in the script such as a us marshall who got his job and can't even hit a barn with a pistol a rancher with about thirty hands but can't seem to keep his cattle from being run off br br but there is plenty of the quick thinking straight shooting cooper to keep you entertained br br this movie was made in 1950 people in their 20's and 30's have trouble understanding those movies were made for entertainment not oscars br br to expect oscar material does this film injustice it is about the good guys finding a way to round up the bad guys br br so rent borrow or buy this movie pop some corn and enjoy the coop one more time
<START> this film was hilarious it provided a somewhat comical view of the british club scene which if you really look at it is a funny thing the characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves br br there were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work the getting ready scenes the get me a real doctor scene the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being wrecked ending with the infamous line what was i saying and the comedown sunup scenes i have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour br br i can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to groove which i thought was out of this world but it certainly has its moments the mise en scene and the camera work is superb the special effects are well worth mentioning and the acting is fantastic br br after waiting a long time to see this film i am glad to say that i was not disappointed i hope to see more from the writer director in the future
<START> it is difficult today and in the us to understand this movie we have nothing really to compare it with here is an attempt at comparison it is as if during the last years of rule a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film which for the first time ever showed life as it really was lived in that country the life of ordinary young girl with all the terror and the repression full blown then the film was exhibited freely in iraq if you could imagine that unlikely event then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union prior to this film soviet cinema was highly censored soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise then suddenly this the alcoholism the random sex the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city the choking pollution the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves the utter hopelessness it is all there people were stunned soviet women would often weep during the showings many would say that this is the story of their lives it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing it undoubtedly the breakup of the soviet union br br reading the reviews here i can see that few understand this film one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex to the soviet viewers at the time the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema br br others compare it to current films such as as good as it gets might as well compare homer's to the latest john novel they simply do not compare this is not just a film this is was a social document and a transforming social force it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film br br other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life there was nowhere else to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same this was life in the soviet union for most people br br this is a film that can be viewed on many levels as a drama it traces the landscape of despair as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the break up of the soviet union and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other br br little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims despite any good intentions that system may have in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history
<START> this program was on for a brief period when i was a kid i remember watching it whilst eating fish and chips br br riding on the back of the tron hype this series was much in the style of and the like except more there was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy he'd go around solving crimes and the lot br br all i really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally br br when i mention it to anyone they can remember very little too was it real or maybe a dream
<START> i saw a test screening of blurred recently and i am surprised to say that it was actually pretty good its a film about different groups of kids your hillbillies your rich snobs your typical teenage couple plus two geeky guys and one post hippie babe together but as separate storylines each group is travelling to the gold coast for week australia has never had any problems writing comedy and australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and just the right amount on quirkiness the cast is full of stellar aussie actors with enormous talent and loads of screen presence keep your eyes on craig horner a young graduate who's optimism for a week long party gets lost in his friends shenanigans travis cotten and mark priestly who successfully tackle some tricky physical comedy as two bummed out and jessica gower as a cutie but confused teen angsting about love veronika makes her film debut as every adolescent boys dream girl and holds her own amongst an array of considerably more experienced performers look out for matthew newton cleverly cast as a seedy limo driver fantastic aussie
<START> i watched this movie with my mother she is 81 yrs old and was raised to be a bigot she even acknowledges this i don't think she really understood what was happening she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty scary i felt for this child and his family what torture they went through and remained faithful that is true faith back to the movie i was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude i am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him i could tell when one the cops was lying he would not look the defender in the eyes his eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions it is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men they were finally found guilty after many years i can't remember the title but it was the same premise whites doing whatever they want with blacks i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time if not forever i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white no comment from her i want to commend the director and producer of this film i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project i am an avid viewer of indy films i feel that they are well written and have substance i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society
<START> sweet rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch the movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk but her friends too as they shop party hang out and go to the mall if the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non stop for a week the music will songs like johnny are you queer are found throughout also elizabeth daily is a funny existential character and the prom king queen speech at the end is hilarious
<START> a movie i've seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie i first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and the great climactic battle as i got older i enjoyed it as much or more than before but now due to all of the components that work together to make a true classic the acting is great especially keith as t roosevelt the cinematography spectacular the script is full of gems and the directing pulls it all together wonderfully it's loosely based on an actual event and it shows rush of europe and a newly america to carve up the 'sick old man' the ottoman empire as it collapses in a fashion unlike any other 'historical' movie i've seen humor drama action love it's got it all and deserves far more acclaim much like 'the great waldo
<START> following the advice of a friend i got myself this movie i'm very fond of computers in general hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen i had some bad echoes about it but in the end i wasn't so disappointed the story though classical is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see computer performed actions are somehow realistic as they use windows 3 x and normal computers the storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer the end is typically american the actors' performance is globally ok sandra bullock usually annoys me with her oh my god why me way to behave but this time she seems to have controlled herself i'd recommend that movie
