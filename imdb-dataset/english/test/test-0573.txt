<START> quite simply a well made well written and wonderfully acted movie eastwood is classic as grizzled secret service agent frank and rene russo br br holds her own as partner and love interest lilly raines but the movie's br br greatness rests on the shoulders of john malkovich as booth he captures br br this character's rage and hatred as well as his humanity oddly enough br br personally i think this was his best performance and should have received an br br oscar for it but i loved tommy lee jones in the fugitive as well that year overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be br br on the edge of your seat the whole way through enjoy
<START> when just days away before the film's premiere its screenwriter backs out of the project and demands his name to be removed from the credits you know that this does not bode well br br the books on which is based on have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film Â de is a his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world but not everything monstrous looking is evil and not everything fair is but all that didn't matter when a polish film crew with a low budget and no or little appreciation for work decided to make a 13 part mini series out of it the two hour film is a by product of their actions to maximize the profits br br it's not hard to point out in this case what makes people label this film as bad plot incoherent thanks to cramming it with too many stories acting below average with exception of dialogues bland editing choppy special effects unbearable and choreography poor add up to the film's overall bad experience only the soundtrack done by brings out the beauty of the world of which was never brought to the screen even grandiose flora and fauna where part of the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe was shot a crucial element in almost any fantasy film were not used up to their full potential the more i think about this dead loss the more i'm running out of words at least it's a comfort to know that the director of has directed only one film ever since in addition in germany br br for now we're left with top notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer rpg released in 2007 referring to the books but i'm sure that one day justice will be done for the saga and we'll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough
<START> without going into any details of a good if a somewhat provocative tv movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame here br br i disagree yes the young male lover of beverly d'angelo played by rob estes may be young and horny and good looking because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesn't mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i don't buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adult he said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes it's a good flick but he got what was coming to him don't kid yourselves folks that what happened was no one's fault
<START> back in college i studied marketing and even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing namely it's not what you sell it's how you sell it this principle fully applies to the devil's triangle as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package writer director richard knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention away from the major inaccuracies so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king crimson and i'm guessing richard dirty little tricks worked very efficiently as there was a huge bermuda triangle hype going on during the mid 70's and literally every movie production Â whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick Â covering the topic earned big money at the box office the devil's triangle overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating stark voice of the almighty vincent price generates an ambiance of fright and creepiness the narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of strange occurrences and mysterious vanishings of ships and airplanes in the bermuda triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent mr price invariably ends every chapter with the sinister words Â just another unsolved mystery of the devil's after a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic but i guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974 the documentary expands a little more on the most notorious bermuda triangle mysteries like the five planes of military flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the vessel uss cyclops but still even in these chapters only a minimum of serviceable information is given the cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the bermuda area for example and the testimonies of the supposedly real life witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes if you're looking for an informative and objective documentary on the bermuda triangle i certainly wouldn't recommend this movie but in case you want to sit back and listen to vincent price's hypnotizing voice for nearly a full hour this is your chance
<START> the first two movies of this series excelled for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society this movie doesn't have any of that natural footage which i understand is part of the point but it really makes the entire video component of the film seem like random images stuck together ones and zeroes flying around computer models of human skeletons and so forth occasionally the stock footage is put to good effect the nationalism finance segment around 35 00 but usually it makes the video appear to lack any meaningful content and demands you accept the context of the stock photographers rather than the context of the director it's no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine three stars added for the philip glass soundtrack
<START> this is a very good black comedy with a great view on how different people have a different perception of the same situations the three main characters each met a girl named jewel played by liv tyler who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men each of the three men go through the same situations but when they tell of them to other people their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say that is a very good concept probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie the plot is very good very bizarre and extreme which makes it a good black comedy the acting is equally good not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league the comedy is very black pitch black in some scenes and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it overall this movie is not for everyone's taste but most people who like black comedy will probably love it as it is definitely one of the better black comedies 7 10
<START> i don't know what movement was this film about i saw this film a year ago i am an orthodox woman living in an orthodox community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie it's so far away from the reality it's scary the director could at least hire a rabbi for a brief consultation before making a realistic movie about ultra for example morning prayers or a jewish wedding or a ritual bath customs br br movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies but it's not them that bothered me it's the spiritual side are portrayed next to taliban woman are powerless while men are the ultimate rulers please no one can force a jewish girl to the against her will we also live by the law which clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife no beating and no raping also and no man even rabbi is allowed to peak at the woman in the and is not to place a hand over woman's head while she's taking a ritual bath the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time director was clearly trying to bash ultra but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner br br love story cute but not credible dialogs are long and boring the ending sucked totally for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending for all that sitting i felt i deserved it obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews or for non jews perhaps look at those fundamentalist they are so evil and mean and they succeed long thing short was hoping for a nice kane level movie got instead a tradition bashing unrealistic mistakenly guiding junk i mean today we live in a time of a free will as never before everyone has a right to choose chose a rock singer made her choice meir made his many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these days because in this mad world religion might be a nice gateway
<START> after reading many good things about it i finally watched the clearing with a cast of great actors like redford and dafoe one would at least expect a decent film after the closing credits had rolled i was still shocked by how bad and incoherent this movie actually was br br is it supposed to be an art film i don't think so cause it is too melodramatic for that the bad thing is that the drama seems way too forced and unrealistic br br the truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense first of all it never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters it just their so called personal issues what's so bad about redford's character's life that he has to clear it the fact that he cheats occasionally his wife the guy is a millionaire who has had a good life has a great son and a great daughter a wife that loves him and a girlfriend that also seems to be way above the generic mistress type of woman o and a new born grandson the only problem seems to be that he has been working hard for all his life to be a successful person so what it seems that his hard work has really paid off and there's actually no real problems with his life br br then we come to dafoe's character here's someone who was a manager for one of redford's companies and was fired why is this guy unemployed for eight years it seems that he must have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had in the first place and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work as evident by his flashback of a conversation that he had with redford when he was working for him why couldn't a man like that get a decent job and have a decent life cause he was once fired totally unrealistic br br the film really tries to portray these men as tortured souls or something and that comes off as really cheesy in fact i would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the american dream then they failed miserably br br as for the actual events that take place during the movie they also make no sense at all in fact the last 20 minutes of the film come off as an insult to the viewer's intelligence because there's not one thing that takes place that actually makes any sense redford seems to have about a 1000 chances to escape yet he doesn't at one moment he is ready to escape and yet he misses his chance cause he feels sorry for his kidnapper and doesn't want to hurt him then dafoe picks up his gun from the water and the mud which should be useless if you fire a shot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and mud it will possibly blow up in your face and the gun is in perfect condition the way an unemployed useless as portrayed in this film and mentally unstable character manages to outsmart the entire fbi with such ease brings the narrative of this film to twilight zone levels the cheesy ending with redford's wife illusion comes to finish the viewer off br br this film pretends to be something it's not i e a quality sophisticated psychological thriller unfortunately it fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and that's the word that describes this film best a disaster
<START> that's certainly not the best film ever but that's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind so the one who loves sadness and depression and scary fairy tales at night and wolves and real madness welcome if you find a copy of course as for me i could stand it only once but since that the wolves and saint lucy and children's drawings and a headless christ live in my nightmares
<START> this film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally at the end of the 1960's decade it was immensely entertaining and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period and were still ongoing in terms of the black power movement vietnam and the volatile movement which followed the quieter preceding postwar 1950's br br all of this and one of the funniest films then or now br br viewing it for the second time recently i was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally its humor is as funny and its message as strong br br and in viewing it now you get all of this while at the same time gaining the added enjoyment of its being a period piece and a superb chronicling of its this historic turbulent time
<START> would be promising if it were a student film never seems to know where it's going next as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film as a result much repetition and a deadening pace there's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world it involves the internet phone calls a computer science experiment a suspicious grad student withdrawn behavior red rooms dark stains and then suicides good luck figuring out the connections or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely characters are barely sketched which could be ok but they're completely uninteresting it's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario although the conclusion is nonsensical weakest moment when the boss sits down to give some incoherent advice
<START> i am not a golf fan by any means on may 26 about 10 30 pm the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's old movies i like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy harry is awaken by the voices of men he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something so then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on the movie is excellent we then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning don't want to give away too much i was up until 2 a m this is super please see the movie
<START> it sounded so promising in the rental store the premise sounded great and i couldnt wait to get home and watch it it was apalling the diologue is dreadful the action is extremely badly scripted and the plot takes a nosedive from the beginning gutenberg puts in a pathetic performance sean bean tries his best but with a script this bad there wasnt much he could do br br this isnt even worth watching even if you can get it for free borrow it off a friend for instance dont as you will regret it and waste 90 of your life br br 0 10
<START> in the movie the falcon and the snowman when they were showing christopher boyce around the complex the satellite in the background was the actual satellite that is now in space allowed interior shots also allowed both interior and exterior shots for one of the original star trek tv series the episode is the one where spock goes blind when a string of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens christopher escaped jail and was featured on america's most wanted he was drinking in a bar when the show aired he said hey that's me needless to say he was captured and transfered to a maximum security jail
<START> i saw night of the demons 2 first before i saw night of the demons unfortunately my old blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel but no first one looney huh now i think all horror fans need this movie it's like mcdonald's you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have the cheesecake or whatever restaurant you prefer but you can't help but just wanting the cheap stuff br br night of the demons has it all your innocent sexy goes by the rules chicka dee your token black guy that surprisingly doesn't get killed you're slutty girl you're slutty guy you're dark girl or guy the goof ball the cheesy settings of a haunted house bad acting and lots of unnecessary nudity isn't this stuff great i mean i know deep down in my heart of movies that this was pretty bad but it was a good bad for horror movies horror fans should enjoy and dig in br br 8 10
