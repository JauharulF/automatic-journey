<START> i have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot started watching this movie by accident lazy sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on and was mesmerized by martin sheen and emilio estevez wow gut wrenching kudos to everyone have always admired martin sheen but was particularly impressed with emilio excellent job of acting and directing simply superb so why have i never heard of this movie before i'll have to spread the news
<START> mst3k fodder it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason there are some hilarious things in it such as the mysterious device the bad guy is seen working on for the whole movie that turns out to be this tiny helicopter that flutters around carrying and firing a machine gun without so much as a wobble but is brought down by a bag of balloons the kind they release at political conventions many other wonderful touches of that sort stars charlie sheen there's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation only to drop the in the river by accident if they'd cast emilio estevez in the part that never would've happened
<START> i can't count the times i have watched this and although it differs from the book in story line the mood is still the same the bond that two such diverse people give each other that surpasses trials and years is immortal and that the element of the women prisoners was an actual event that did happen to real people the story is about the strength of character of ordinary people people who just tried to survive a horrible time in their lives and this also presented australia in a real mode the country is like all countries areas that everyone loves quaint country areas and desolate areas but it gives a stage for transformation from a lowly outback town to a family community
<START> for the first forty minutes or so luna is a real pleasure to watch the characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and locations are beautiful to look at then jill clayburgh discovers her son matthew barry is using heroin and the movie starts to unravel and then becomes outright laughable in its sickness br br clayburgh asks him why and when he started using the drug and she nor the audience ever get a straight answer which would be a bit helpful he mentions not caring about anything but that's not right because we see clearly in the amazing early scenes that he has a good deal of interest in his mother's singing baseball sex and apparently cared enough to turn down marijuana this movie is for people who think junior gets into hard drugs because mom and dad were workaholics who missed his piano recital i think such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug like heroin was chosen as some sort of intellectual catalyst for the later scenes of incest there's a lot of discussion about the mother's love for the son but it's really about bertolucci being pretentious luna would have been great as a quaint little family drama br br how old was matthew barry in this movie i was more concerned over the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this film than for anything his character was going through out of
<START> yes the movie is not a piece of art but the first time i watched it i was 10 years old my parents were out and i stayed home with my two brothers it was may 1970 i know that because i found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network had it's one of the most vivid memories i have with the guys we ended all in one bed and covered up to the head our very first horror movie we kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment those were horror movies nowadays horror movies are always the same or was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogs most sure it was that but for me this is a great movie
<START> over the weekend i watched the movie tipping the velvet and if i was to have to score this movie out of 100 i would have to give it 100 no question asked i am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in alot of different ways and the actors fit the parts without a but i have to say that the ending was not so great for i did not see that spark in nancys eyes when ever she looked into eyes as her eyes sparked each time she looked at kitty kitty only had to be in the room or in nancy's thought and nancy would just glow that spark kitty told nancy that she could not find her and that she looked for her but could not find her kitty was ready to give it all up to get nancy back in kitty's eyes you could see kitty's pain i believe that nancy should have let kitty see that thier love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy you need to make a part two and have the two make it together but you must not let anyone else play the roles it has to be the real kitty nancy or it'll never work my mother once told me that true love is just not real i am no fool i know that we all have a true love out someplace just waiting for each of us and i believe with my life that nancy's true love really is only kitty and kitty's true love is only nancy come on lets play the game the right way the only way let nancy's eyes shine again kitty lost her everything by losing nancy and kitty is not to be the only one to blame i am gay myself and being gay is not easy wake up in 1889 i'd not want to be gay kitty was lost deep inside herself and in 1889 maybe the right thing to do was to be married to a man even though you love a woman kitty needed nancy to stand up to her needed nancy to fight for her myself i remember how deeply i loved this girl and i let her get away because i thought i was doing something wrong and i went back to my ex boyfriend i thought i was doing the right thing but i know i was wrong to let go of her and i will pay for the rest of my days for like kitty i could not find her anyplace i heard that she is married to a man in the u s a someplace i even heard that he beats her i guess in the end we both lose give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one br br thank you kristen ann
<START> you can survive anything anything except a dumb horror flick the director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer you can't have both it's like michael moore trying to have his cake and eat it too or in his case 1500 cakes by making his particular charlatan brand of docu comedies they're supposed to be oh so hilarious and zany and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth based earth shattering hard hitting documentaries some genres cannot be mixed br br anything can happen to anyone any time any place translation this is the horror genre so we can do any kind of nonsense we want this sounds not so much like something wise found on a paper of a chinese fortune cookie but more like the credo of every bad horror film director we get this baloney of a statement served to us early on sort of as a preparation justification of the absurd buffoonery to come br br my phone isn't working well of course it isn't there is a far greater chance that sean penn's brain starts working after decades of catatonic apathy than that a horror film cell phone does the single most dreary and predictable horror clichÃ© of the past decade why even say it we know help will never come via a phone call so ye horror making might as well just not even mention it the last 50 horror films i saw use this plot device it's becoming embarrassing br br you always have to expect the unexpected the final twist was rather surprising i'll give them that much however plenty of nonsense on the way there br br check out the elaborate traps the heroine sets up with the speed of a drugged up lab rat in the cold wet and almost totally dark conditions i just love horror film realism br br when a blood thirsty demon starts trying to be funny by his victims then you know your horror viewing pleasure is in doubt the less said about the old geezer cracking wise the better another stupid clichÃ© served by a tired lazy uninspired director br br what are the odds of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye hating demon on the same day expect the unexpected they might as well have squeezed in an event in which she survives a plane crash and then another in which she encounters aliens who tried to anal probe her br br the fast forward button needs a temple or a shrine built in its image
<START> this coming from an adult who happened to come across the first one expecting a movie aimed towards children and was surprised at the adult humor that was in new groove the character i liked most of all was so i was thrilled when i heard of the sequel sp featuring non other than br br i just watched new groove it took me two days because i had to shut it off i was so bored halfway through it i finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first br br being a disney film i was expecting to have some musical scenes however this one was filled with them and they were not amusing the great thing i found about new groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience from toddlers to adults new groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first it is really aimed towards young children the comedy is pretty childish the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely corny br br save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worthy of a second viewing i was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was they actually managed to make a character not funny in this film that is amazing in itself br br obviously every ones opinion differs but i am very easily amused i usually enjoy sequels sp even when others discredit them mostly because i loved the first so much i needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was i would enjoy the film i cannot say the same for this one i never would have thought i would be turning it off half way through due to pure boredom br br buy at own risk
<START> overambitious and shoddy and at times too darkly lit dark reality's scenario is not even close to being original dark and dank basement kidnapped prisoners fearful survival carey alisha tells her family and friends she will be backpacking across europe she doesn't make it out of town she is grabbed from a rainy sidewalk drugged and awakes chained in a dungeon she eventually realizes she is not alone and upon meeting a few of her fellow captives there is different thoughts on survival her cell mates start dying off one by one can she garner enough strength and courage to see daylight again others in the cast laila rachel oliva eva arthur bullock and jen parker
<START> ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie i have lived here my whole life i have waited for this movie to come out and i mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me it was worth it br br the movie is different from the book but in my eyes it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book in both i cried there were moments that tore me up i laughed and i smiled just as much it's a great movie with a great story line br br it's about never giving up on finding that one the one that will change you forever the one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of life br br i have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever which is what gere's character did to lane's i met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that i never forgot him or how smitten i was with him until i him again a year later for me i could relate to this movie with my whole heart i think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what i'm talking about it's never too late to find your true love great work ms lane and mr gere
<START> this one gets better with each new look certainly one of paul sorvino's best roles outstanding music score which was also outstanding on sound track lp so why no cd one the very early dolby stereo sound film releases by the way the original 35mm theatrical trailer for this is really great
<START> i saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it it is so sweet and heartwarming a real tear jerker i was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie it's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through it's something anybody can relate to i really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a saturday night rental with your girlfriends your family your boyfriend everyone will really enjoy it d it's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings not to mention beautiful landscape shots and fantastic acting see it i'm sure you'll love it as much as i did
<START> i'm mike i co wrote the score for this movie and proud of it br br and i love all of the comments some have not gone far enough br br the movie premiered in san francisco in the summer of 1973 the theater was packed with friends and family we all clapped br br five days latter it was pulled from all of the screens in the bay area br br if anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details which might make the movie even more enjoyable please let me know br br we could start with the shot where gideon blake throws the toilet to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of bud's house br br or how gideon diffused the bomb in the original version br br didn't help it still bombed br br bring it on
<START> the china syndrome could not have been released at a better time twelve days after its release the infamous screw up in three mile island happened but even if that and or had never happened this movie remains an important look at what could happen through mismanagement of nuclear facilities jack lemmon turns in a five star performance as the supervisor trying to expose a cover up at his nuclear plant with jane fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate and michael douglas plays her cameraman br br i don't know whether or not the current threat of a terrorist attack makes the china syndrome more disturbing but either way it's still definitely a movie that everyone should see br br i hope that those people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so that they could know that their views and ideals are completely defunct
<START> i cannot believe i actually set up a on my tivo for this apparently they had a good preview or something i can't imagine it though after seeing about 5 minutes i thought to myself why am i watching this it is definitely not reality and some of the worst acting i have ever seen on television i am a total addict of reality tv and there is nothing real about this the acting if you can call it that is awful the only ones that are almost 5 decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either this is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap there is no way they could get a job in anything else someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service maybe they could do that oh and by the way p i no longer occupies any space on my tivo or tivo's season pass list definitely the worst show i've ever seen
