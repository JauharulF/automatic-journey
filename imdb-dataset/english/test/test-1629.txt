<START> a charming movie enhanced by the musical and vocal background especially during the competition my understanding is that there was never a soundtrack but could you through your sources advise me where i might get information on the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang your help would be appreciated the song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy wherever possible so that we might play it as background music when we have our family and friends over for our italian nights if you are able to get this information to us we would be eternally grateful even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go direct br br regards br br john
<START> i am always impressed when a director and this case director screenwriter takes a piece of classical text and makes it come alive sure shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self importance but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe inspiring there are many troubling things about the play it is a racist play about racism and that still sticks i have never accepted jessica's desertion of her father without any acceptable reason i have never accepted the position of sanctimonious self righteousness but brilliantly there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set and mercifully much of jessica's part is cut br br the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut but i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it and it was replaced by a look that said it all this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie not just a film of the play br br and at last there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserving unrelated you can almost feel antonio's pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of passing by in a gondola or arriving for a visit but it is as subtle as that no more i was spellbound br br there were many other highlights i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking and the trials are hilarious br br add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times and you'll understand why i can't wait to see it again and again
<START> last year i fell in love with the tim burton's version of sweeney todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library though i think burton's is best probably because i like film a lot better than theater this is still a great production of the story i haven't seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on them br br after seeing johnny depp as todd it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role but george does a fantastic job angela lansbury is great as always and all of the singing is fantastic i found myself singing along this is a play you won't want to miss but try and see it before you see the film version so you won't have a biased view like me
<START> if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this br br don't get me wrong i a good crappy movie i am a big fan of films like wizard of mars queen king and others real classics of b cinema br br but this film actually makes jack nicolson and boris karloff in the terror look like an academy award winner the dialouge is so needlessly long winded and mostly inappropriately used ie i will now yes to your wishes the acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines br br the story what story a count is exiled because his wife had leprosy i'm still not sure on that count a rich fleet one and the captian of one of his ships crash on the island people acting unnaturally ok i like camp in b films a lot there lies a lot of it's charm but this was just dumb plain dumb a salty sea captian who sounds as well versed as a college professor a fleet owner who is as clueless as they come i felt this guy had no idea of how to play it one scene he's spanish acting the next english european the count who's not sure if he's a reincarnation or really don't ask me how figures into this after 4 beers my wife friend and i still couldn't figure it out br br the scare factor i could show this turkey to my small grandkids and only worry about them sleeping through it i like a lot of early 60's horror movies and some still have good shocks but this thing never had a shock or even a hint of of a scare br br on the info on the back it says this movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare the only degradation is watching this movie it's 90 mins the case says it's 74 mins of your life you do not get back br br i paid only a buck yes one buck for this and another film i still feel like i am owed 50 cents for even sitting though this br br to sum up dungeon of harrow had no one named harrow in it but it did have a lovely cardboard dungeon
<START> a highly original film using a myriad of genres and film techniques to stunning and powerful effect all people involved gave only their very best and it shows on screen a committed film with a committed cast and crew simply brilliant just go and see it now
<START> largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects the claw in question is a giant puppet that would make jim henson want to kill himself i just saw the movie last thursday and i can't even tell you who was in it that's a bad sign i'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower basically i should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words produced by sam katzman came on the screen if i knew what was good for me but then i sat through also so i guess i deserve it
<START> american graffiti is one of the best movies ever made i've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it i graduated from high school in 1962 br br however more american graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made br br it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate i served 18 months in vietnam with the 101st airborne division br br the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it br br if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies more american graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong
<START> i am a huge fan of northern exposure men in trees is a complete knock off of northern exposure there's the city folk from new york stuck in a remote backwoods town marin joel she immediately doesn't hit it off with a local jack maggie o'connell the town only has one pilot who is not often available ther is only one radio show and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships too many parallels just like northern exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character i'm bored give me something new to think about br br on the upside the writing is pretty good but if this was a school project it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism br br perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of joshua brand and john
<START> br br it's common knowledge and has been said before no one can ever play scarlett and rhett like vivien leigh and clark gable joanne whalley kilmer no longer kilmer having been divorced from ex hubby val kilmer plays her own scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re make god forbid she still cannot rise to the occasion i e her voice sounds evil on several occasions she's got brown eyes scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even vivien leigh's eyes were green and her vocal power was not up to the job either scarlett is a southern belle therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting as she did in scarlett the novel and gwtw of course and to be a great flirt like scarlett is you would most likely need a higher pitched voice like vivien leigh br br i suppose i'm comparing kilmer to leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as leigh did with scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective timothy dalton should have had no accent whatsoever due to the fact that both margaret mitchell's rhett and gable in the film had none his acting has never been truly noteworthy except maybe his portrayal of the evil conniving king phillip of france in the lion in winter and he gives very little if any freshness or vitality to his rhett br br standouts in the cast are most notably tina a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance as the tragic victim mary boyle and then of course there's sean bean as the cold calculating and not to mention almost demonically evil lord fenton mary's nemesis and scarlett's eventual violator one thing i could not forgive the writer for was the fact that scarlett is raped in this movie a fact that never occurred in the novel lord fenton is cold and of ill repute among the irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart another omission from the novel but for the film is the character of belle watling played most horribly by ann margret in a cameo role which we all could have lived without seeing as how the book was such a run away bestseller without requiring any assistance from ms watling br br for a film by itself scarlett is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being gone with the winds sequel another actress was highly necessary for scarlett as well as rhett br br
<START> there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don't see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
<START> peter yates film from the pen of steve is a relatively low key thriller that doesn't really manage to get off the ground story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran james woods who the police believe may have taken revenge on his ex employer as the eyewitness william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act br br hurt is well below his usual strength and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black br br in retrospect steve story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick the plot is far too contrived br br friday october 17 1997 video
<START> after spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode three minutes the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is with the use of the boat jack and sayid come up with a plan to confront the others however when jack sawyer kate and hurley follow michael to the others jack is forced to reveal michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere br br meanwhile locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if the button is not pressed however mr resolve to continue pressing the button is surprisingly strong so when locke concocts a plan to lock eko out of the hatch with the help of an ally eko goes to surprisingly desperate lengths to stop locke from making what he believes will be a big mistake br br this is a classic episode of lost full of secrets suspense and very few answers to the many questions it poses to its viewers however some of the secrets this action packed episode reveals will be truly shocking to the fans there is also a trademark end of season cliffhanger which achieves the feat of being both shocking and extremely confusing one thing is guaranteed it will keep you guessing right to the very end and you will still be frustrated with more mind boggling questions as you wait in agony for the third season to begin
<START> i didn't really know what to expect from future kill but i certainly hoped it would be a little better than what i got i knew the rating was bad and the reviews were but the subversive dvd cover illustration looks beyond cool and i can't resist that for a very long too long in fact time this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to porky's with lame vulgar and offensive fraternity pranks five mega dorks one of them resembling an exact young clone of jim carrey desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate initiation might just be a tad bit far fetched and dangerous they are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war it doesn't take too long before they are confronted with splatter a seemingly half man and half machine warrior who leads a gang of which i never really figured out who or what they were were they a government experiment cyborgs terminator imitations from a distant future does anyone care future kill is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative the plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like the warriors escape from new york and the terminator but the end result is one gigantic sci fi monstrosity the costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and there's a truckload of cheap and gratuitous nudity the acting is terrible but i'm willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members one to avoid at all costs in spite of really cool dvd cover art resist it
<START> this wonderful film is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to last even so they can be great worth the pain suffering of breakup br br director gives us an insight of the period around 1900 the way society mis treats women and how a very strong woman deals with with great costumes landscapes lovely music and good actors and acting this draws you in for the length of the movie br br at first the ending is a bit sudden a page describing the rest of her life scrolls on reflection this is a great the best way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life br br this was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles by the first being schindler's list apparently the movie had this effect on everybody
<START> a friend and i went to see this movie we have opposite opinions about but after watching this movie we agree on the following the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really abusing their power to make it even worse the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with regime she decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to peruvians but this is not surprising because both the director and the cia are violating the sovereignty of peru by trying to affect the democratic processes at very different levels of course br br if the director was really interested in helping peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary in any case there are numerous peruvian made documentaries films and books about the subject such include ojos que no ven dias de santiago las dos de la etc the director of the fall of should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations
