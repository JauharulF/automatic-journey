<START> seriously you've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it it came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy the little rascals mr nanny etc yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm every single character in the movie is driven by rage with the exception of mother who shows only aggravation and weariness possibly at the tired clichÃ©'s this movie enjoys br br to put it simply the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting nor the filming but most notably the writing the lines we receive are reminiscent of disney classics although this film lacks the whole heartedness il' walt managed to pull off junior's dad john ritter makes you mad without even doing anything simply because he allows junior to run around unsupervised and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200 pound behemoth to a chalk board br br also junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating for those of you who saw the first one found it nauseating and thus did not see the second one big ben healy as he is referred to in this movie is still a total douche he basically into john ritter's house uninvited settles himself in junior's room even though he says that he hates junior and basically does nothing to accelerate the film's speed or to support the film in any way rather he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader br br finally we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters such as the smug obnoxious trixie who carries dynamite in her backpack which she first lights then hands to junior who simply stares wide eyed at also gilbert gottfried returns in this film this time playing the obnoxious principal at junior's new elementary school if gilbert gottfried ain't enough to get the point across i will put it simply this film reeks br br 2 10 stars because the actor's convictions shine through the film even though the script sucks
<START> if you are like me and observed the original benji phenomenon from afar finally seeing the movie for the first time 30 years later you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974 br br my judgment is not entirely objective as i tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack on the other hand i have always hated this particular dog a feature on the last couple seasons of petticoat junction never a great show the dog less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time br br benji is an 86 minute mega dose of the dog following him on several daily circuits through the town of mckinney texas if this sounds boring you would be advised to give benji a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a benji fan if there are still any out there br br unlike my dog skip monkey business or because of dixie the human actors in the cast are extremely weak big peter breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame br br if one of your children of any age appears to be finding benji entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i went into this movie determined to like it i usually enjoy dramas like wall street glen gary glen ross boiler room etc i went into this movie thinking i would be on the edge of my seat plus i am a big pacino fan br br what a piece of garbage quite possibly the worst movie i have seen in five years this makes pacino's debacle in any given sunday actually look good first half the movie is watching matthew mcconaughey lift weights ok we get it you are in shape matt we don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron shirtless br br secondly how many plot holes are in this movie why introduce the phone call from long lost dad and never address it again what was the point of his mom hanging up on him why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money what was the point of that the guy from puerto rico who lost 30 million also since sports betting is illegal in ny and its acknowledged its illegal how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end br br this was simply a very poorly written script it had potential but it was devoid of a coherent plot i thought pacino learned his lesson about script selection after any given sunday but apparently not my gosh this is the same actor that starred in the godfather br br don't waste your money
<START> i got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 dvds i knew nothing about the history of the series season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4 season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being beyond good and evil with an original air date of 7 december 1998 the other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from december 1997 to 1998 so beyond good and evil looks like season 3 episode 1 except there are no more episodes in season 3 br br spoilers here the two main characters of the first 8 episodes dr mccallum john hannah and dr angela moloney zara turner are missing from this episode being replaced by dr dan gallagher nathaniel parker and dr charley fielding eva pope i recognized nathaniel parker from the series the inspector lynley mysteries which began in 2001 so they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast br br it seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character mccallum when the main character is gone from the series so they might have been planning a return of dr mccallum but when that failed the series was canceled i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and nathaniel parker were involved in other projects in 1999 does anyone have any information on this
<START> i really enjoyed the film it was really cheesy at times they destroy the villain with hair but where are they plugged in it's a unique film though and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope i also enjoyed however you write it liking megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb besides the acting the rewinding and showing what happened on ariel's and then megan's point of view was quite interesting i saw it twice and i'd see it again
<START> wow it's even better than i expected the best animated movie ever and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of again i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of but i suggest that you go to see the french version cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast did you know that roger carel has played for nearly forty years i think he did a marvelous job and the song from cÃ©line dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits the music is good the drawings are good the actors are wonderful in a word a masterpiece go to see it you will not regret this
<START> this documentary focuses on the happenings in gothenburg 2001 in swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence this movie shows that there not actually they are intelligent articulate people that has something to say and says it by the force of bricks they believe in a better world a world where people can think and say what they want without being aimed at but are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic i think not br br this documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed capitalism and the future it might bring it is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong br br i have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it i think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief all you get is more facts to rely on for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a mcdonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think br br overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen that fought violence with violence did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march and in some cases beating people with even though they are lying on the street without making resistance where as good as it gets br br rating 8 10 very good but not best
<START> how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie the lack of script is one thing but the cinematography makes you want to weep a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it's of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden it would be a shame for the industry if he or any in the team for that matter is given money to make a film ever again this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year
<START> i though that it was hard if not impossible to watch and not because of the horrors it depicts but by the way they were depicted imagine what costa gavras could have done with this true horror story what i object to is the idea the need to denounce which i subscribe to is enough what about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema i feel that the eagerness of the filmmaker maybe even the justifiable anger didn't allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view or if this was a cinematic point of view i mean a choice then i didn't like it at all i was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself well intentioned i'm sure but unfortunately that's not nearly enough
<START> i watched cheats a few years ago with my friend he hyped it up as a great funny film that is one of the best comedies ever i think he was on crack or something i just recently learned that this film was not released into theatres i can understand why perfectly br br the basic plot involves a group of guys who cheat on pretty much all of their assignments in school to get good grades that is the main problem of this film is that the morals are all bad there are other teen comedy films where students do bad things but it is most often stuff that does not take place at school so i think that the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids cheating on everything is pretty bad br br i did not like the characters in this film either the main character guy is a completely smug arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist actually i am not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist due to the fact that they all are cheating at school which is wrong the other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the cast blows in this film br br this film has a bad message and even worse acting and characters there are other teen films that are way better than this film so you do not have to see this one and that is a good thing because i do not recommend this film at all
<START> it was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie the director maintained focus on the main subject without venturing into side plots the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients that are so typical of bollywood assembly line products he kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray the rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon the zeal of the social worker gave the movie a feel of genuineness i am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of anand or safar a couple of scenes toward the end of the movie such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy at the sound of splashing and birds chirping are sure make your eyes misty br br many bollywood players do not realize that oscar committee members value simplicity of the subject and genuineness and brevity of the movie more than the glitz and glamor is certainly a better nomination than lagaan which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death no mpaa member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and a lot of song and dance br br i look forward to more movies from director sawant in the future
<START> as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family after coming to an arrangement with rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah eventually she accompanies her cousin a passionate leader of the brotherhood to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been scorned by rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of fenton until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision
<START> it pains me to say this about an australian film but mr accident ranks with the worst of the worst films i have ever seen what's even more tragic is that it doesn't fit into the 'it's so bad it's good' category what annoys me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been away on a pointless unfunny underdeveloped inept screenplay dumb performances what are garry mcdonald and elisabeth gore aka elle doing in this trash inadequate direction no plot and a general sense of meanness totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth comedy ha do yourself a favour and stay away
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen as well as the worst that i will probably ever see i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously just be forewarned br br this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it its just plain bad bad bad bad bad br br this movie is the equivalent to having a pet rock as your friend you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen unfortunately it never does at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into lion's gate completely deceives on this bombshell no this is a disaster after watching this film you would swear george w bush had his hands all over the making of this film yes its that idiotic br br stay away unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time its probably how lion's gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe
<START> let's face it br br this movie is incredibly clichÃ© as korean romance dramas and movies go first of all there's a pair of long lost siblings one of which falls in love with the other second there's a not so popular girl and two gorgeous popular guys who fall for and fight over her third one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease which eventually takes his life br br still i like this movie br br without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel but because the actors fit the roles perfectly the movie is engrossing i honestly couldn't stop watching kang dong won despite his pretty face gives an awesome heartrending performance not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun plus all the supporting actors br br i'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone
