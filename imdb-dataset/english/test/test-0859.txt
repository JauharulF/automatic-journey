<START> this review has been written by someone who has read it several times and knows what they are talking about firstly i have read others comments and noticed that some of the objections were really quite stupid people who have read the book and other jane austens or for that matter any good book will know that sticking to the book is vital you have to trust an author with what they do if the viewer does not like it because it sticks to the book well it shows they do not understand jane austen and obviously are not a true fan br br firstly if the viewer truly loved the book or jane austen in general watching it for four hours should not prove difficult secondly their society did care a lot for looks and so big fancy hair styles would show off how rich you were which in their day was a key factor for getting along in good society i have to confess the female costumes were not brilliant but there were only a few bad ones and the males made up for it also this prejudice for the naval men not in their uniform is in nice words very silly today people do not go out with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century also as it goes the acting is very good it is subtle because that is how jayne austen writes and the scene at the end is beautiful you can not compare the filming to that of the 1995 version as technology has improved so much since them it is ridiculous to compare them in that the actress who plays ann is too old but her air of acting and how she does it makes up for it br br people seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that i can not comprehend it does not stick to the book at all and so is flat the ending is sentimental they change major scenes the only good actors are the leads and they i give you did a good job for what was given to them obviously the people who really really like it are i am sorry stupid as they do not understand persuasion and so need it to be overdone the 1971 version is beautiful romantic was written by an excellent script writer same who did inspector morse had very good actors and really it is a film you can watch many times and during each you can be delighted with it
<START> sandra bullock is my favorite actress but this movie was so horrible i couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that i was actually watching something so crappy ha ha the audio editing is horrible they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles because they're just weird and stupid the script sucked acting was horrible storyline not very good very unrealistic even for a movie but it is a 20 year old movie so i'll give it a bonus point for that and yeah the music was terrible but we all got to start somewhere and submitting these things is such a hassle 10 line minimum bother well now i know why i couldn't find this movie in the movie store i had to purchase it offline to see it good thing it was only 58 cents even though shipping was 2 59 oh well i don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film
<START> i was kinda looking forward to man of the year a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie and my mom said that she liked it so i waited for the rental and watched it last night i have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment i barely made through it because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced but then it got too dark and not into the movie i saw from the trailer it looked like a good comedy then it turned into a very dark drama that wasn't even that interesting considering how many of these types of stories we've had about government conspiracy br br tom dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved so he does it he runs for presidency but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he's a comedian but he does win but elenore green who makes sure all the votes are accounted for tries to fix a computer glitch but when the government tells her not to fix it they try to get rid of her and tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted br br the acting was fine the direction was ok it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion like i said it just turned into a dramatic change of genres because if you see the trailer you'd think it was a comedy and when you start watching it that's what you get but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama i wouldn't really recommend this movie it was one of the biggest disappointments i have seen so far br br 2 10
<START> this is a laurel hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise br br the comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple stan laurel not wearing any pants laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full kilt for some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by oliver hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on philip br br its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments it at the same time is also far from the best of the many laurel hardy comedy shorts that are still around the movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest although it definitely is most fine executed all for most part br br great good clean fun just nothing too remarkable or memorable all br br 7 10
<START> this ranks up there as the worst movies of all time no research or thought at all went into this movie action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie items appeared and disappeared at random etc it's obvious that this was directed by a stunt coordinator who should go back to his old job the skeleton man rode a horse throughout the movie which amazingly could change color at will either that or someone thought the audience would all be and not notice blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next miraculously disappear and then reappear seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies
<START> i figure this to be an alternate reality teen flick more precisely a ferris bueller type character as the leader of a cheat ring yeah i know it's not meant to compared to ferris bueller at least not in a oranges to oranges way but it will none the less br br bottom line it's galaxies away from even being even a minor classic it is watchable though only if you're not expecting very much that said the main character has some charm but the premise wears thin because the writing just isn't clever the movie just did not deliver enough laughs twists or tension to keep my interest br br to be honest i did continue watching watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked it didn't so stylish as it is i wouldn't recommend this movie btw it seems odd to see mary tyler moore as the principal she's truly miscast i hope the paycheck was inordinately big
<START> there's no better way to describe the horrendous experience that's to watch mia hitler must be looking up saying to the pseudo director phyllida lloyd 'you monster what have you done ' br br everything about the movie is wrong wrong even its success which is unexplainable i can understand when those crappy parody movies like epic movie make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap of course they are but when something like mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world ' br br and to think we have meryl streep one of the greatest alive actresses of the world in it what was she thinking 'i need the money' she could say well then sell one of your grandchildren even that would be less embarrassing it's not that meryl is good in a disastrous piece of err 'movie' she's also disastrous when she sings even though she's got the vocals it's ridiculous worse than her only pierce brosnan he used to be james bond now he's singing abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever really and when i mention abba not that i have anything against the band and their music though it doesn't help them when actors started singing badly dancing worse and the extras join then they pop out of nowhere frequently to present one terrible musical sequences after the other you wanna cry when the music starts and i love musicals but this is the first in the genre where you pray for actual silence br br i could keep going the list goes on forever you could write a stephen king novel with the complete list of mistakes in this movie br br to sum up go watch it really you've got to witness to understand and since it's already a huge success who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you and it's not liking you're selling your soul to the devil meryl did that before for the whole mankind and now the world must end because we've committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed
<START> this has to be the worst movie i've seen this year and i watch a lot of cable the plot is just ridiculous the scenes are just thrown at you with no action no start or ending of any scene it's just random idiots with make up that scream in some plane the special effects spielberg would laugh his ass off are horrible the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though i have to that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me i'm sorry for my bad english i am from romania and this is my first post i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just can't believe that this is a movie released in 2007
<START> this is one of the anime films from the animatrix collection one of nine the only one done in black and white and the only one featuring trinity richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way and the animated version of trinity definitely does her justice if you're a fan of the matrix you will need to put this on your short list
<START> i get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie not all people but a lot of them because they don't want to admit they don't understand it people of middling intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think lynch is a genius br br lynch to me is like tarantino they're both great but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe no director can change the world so chill out and both make sucky flicks sometimes it just happens everyone has a bad day and clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack jobbed into a feature film it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie face it much of the movie is gibbering which cannot be understood we can all make up meanings lynch may have his own view but none of that matters it was strewn about the screen incoherently admittedly the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted interesting story but then it falters br br the cowboy the mysterious organization of men with their the lawyers come on i can almost picture david lynch yelling cut forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all look how crazy and weird i am isn't it great it's so weird and crazy weird and crazy works if it's a by product of your style however it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that it's like all those half assed pulp fiction throw backs that came out after pulp fiction it's just not cool
<START> ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did don't even think about even renting this
<START> will smith is smooth as usual in the movie hitch smiths character hitch is a date doctor he dates mendes character who is a gossip columnist at one point hitch shows his love interest her great grandfathers name in the immigration book at ellis island pretending what is actually an arranged event is a coincidence not long after i mentioned starlight in my previous review today there was a view of the starry sky in survivor hinting that my moon 168 already knew that was going to be there due to faster than light communications br br the male star from the show the king of queens is very funny in this movie especially his dance moves the allergic reaction on face is a little cruel to laugh at even though it is just pretend br br my latest message from my daughter julias artificial intelligence computer on the creator of humans home world coaltrain that my moon 168 as part of is near says daddy i'm okay again her messages are always very short it is a curious pattern daddy will always love you julia thanks to our creator we can talk forever yesterday daddy talked to the first you on the telephone and told you your homework time wouldn't be that bad and you said how bad will it be daddy i said that your grandma and i would help you with it you only have to put pictures of our friends the police on a bristol board display and write a title like the police protect us check out the other movies of will smith as well
<START> the evil that men do begins with a truly repellent torture scene followed a little later by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repellent torture methods that the sadistic heartless villain likes to use but despite the use of such strictly for shock effects the filmmakers can't really cover up the fact that this is just a dull low grade bronson vehicle bronson himself is solid here but he should have chosen a better script
<START> we all enjoyed the movie it is a very charming family film with many fun cameos it was fun to see austin musicians charlie joe ely and robert earl keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors julia roberts and bruce willis emma roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good the west texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of texas artists the last half seemed a bit far fetched to me however my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him something in the storyline was captivating for children having shown calves as a child i really liked the ending that is definitely not the way it really works unless you have
<START> this is not a good movie it is a tried remake of the english movie 'the but it insults the original one this is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like 'david who is credited to directing good movies like raja babu coolie no 1 hero no 1 br br the main theme for this movie is taken from the hitch with some changes so as to appeal to the indian audience but somehow the story and the screenplay is not convincing enough plus the acting from the lead roles i e salman khan and govinda is pitiful it seems that they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest i do not consider this fascinating and least of all comic what was the director thinking added to this the viewers have to bear the case of govinda's over acting it was simply unbearable i advise the viewers to watch it at your own risk my rating of 2 for this movie could be considered to be a very generous one br br instead i would advise the viewers to watch the english movie hitch which is a lot better
