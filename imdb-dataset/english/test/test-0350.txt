<START> renee zellweger absolutely shines as nurse betty easily one of the most charming off beat and lighthearted comedies of the year br br when soap opera obsessed waitress betty sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two morgan freeman and chris rock she snaps and thinks the cast members on a reason to love are real she decides to travel to los angeles to find famed heart specialist dr david a character on the show br br as the two oddly paired the caustic rock and the pontificating freeman generate some very fun chemistry and greg kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona renee zellweger turns in an innocent candy coated and sometimes terribly sweet performance as nurse betty she exudes goodness warmth and is irresistible while the script sometimes feels like a sit com is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations zellweger is so likeable and so utterly disarming that it all comes together br br with just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting a winning performance from zellweger a great supporting cast and a competent script nurse betty is utterly delightful br br 7 out of 10
<START> normally for movie reviews i try to be constructive and objective but there is only one word for this uh film sucks the dialogue acting special effects plot set and characters all seem as if they were made up by well my potted plants don't see this for the sake of all that is good and right in this world
<START> walter matthau can always improve a mediocre film and this movie proves it he turns in a very realistic performance as a small time horse trainer and single father not sugar coating either role br br he can be by turns soft hearted and doting then iron handed to his boys and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training we see that he doesn't want his young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in small time races but he seems to be willing to risk the horse's life when he gets into the big time br br this is just one of matthau's wonderful performances and one that i highly recommend
<START> i just watched atoll k laurel and hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as utopia on internet archive expecting to see some extra footage since the ia version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes turns out that it's basically the same version i previously watched on the bargain basement vhs tape from goodtimes home video that ran an hour and 23 minutes with the exception of no product placement of the welch's grape juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space while stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon he still performs fine physical comedy with ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard not to mention a charming female french singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of ollie saying for the last time to stan here's another nice mess you've gotten me into before stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out in other words if you're a die hard laurel and hardy fan this movie is recommended for you to see at least once anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for hal roach from the '20s up through 1940 when they completed their final roach film saps at sea come to think of it even some of the l h fox flicks have yet to see the two they made for m g m from the '40s are better than this one update 8 29 09 just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the italian version on youtube cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the captain in another that captain's wife pulls a gun on cherie in one more giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene stan is dubbed in high pitch here
<START> this movie's script is indistinguishable from others most notably the core another bad movie it's pretty clear why luke perry doesn't get much work but to see the beloved lt commander worf michael dorn resigned to something like this is just sad br br i really can't think of one plot twist that isn't seen coming a mile away that's not an exaggeration br br special effects are very poor even by tv standards the lava flow at the beginning of the movie signaling the coming global disaster starts things off at a very amateurish level and it gets no better from that point on
<START> this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy a fish called wanda although i can't see why the only connection i can find is the monty python one eric idle in nuns john cleese and michael palin in wanda otherwise the two are incomparable br br idle and robbie coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead so they decide to rip off their boss and make for rio when the getaway goes wrong the two are forced to take refuge in a convent as nuns br br what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour once again there are the occasional high spots but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings an attempt at a wanda type manic finish fails too along with the effort at men in drag humour which is hardly surprising when you think about it men trying to be women is funny men trying to be nuns is ridiculous br br friday april 22 1994 video
<START> this movie was made 20 years before my time its introduction of john garfield in the supporting role of mickey borden makes it a classic he slumps onto the screen and your eyes are glued garfield was an original and his portrayal of whipping boy is a must see
<START> superb story of a dedicated young teacher who sets out teaching minority children in an area off south carolina br br jon voight is just tremendous as the headstrong dedicated idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal who believes in stern discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a crusty old school superintendent played with relish by the late hume cronyn madge sinclair is the principal who loves her babies br br as i'm a retired teacher i could in some ways relate to this excellent film the ignorance shown here as well as the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite apparent in urban areas br br voight realizes that these children need far more than the traditional teachings of a classroom he has them go out and experience life by themselves by learning outdoors br br the end is a definite downer but so true to life br br amazing that such backward students had a zest for learning and were well disciplined i guess that answers my question the behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment br br the ending will just tug at your heart it was memorable and so well poignant
<START> spawned by the same monty berman dennis spooner partnership which produced the champions and randall hopkirk deceased the latter retitled my partner the ghost for the us market department s remains a classic example of the action adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s like those two shows its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality dept s also has a black superior but it's mostly facade the launch episode six days is barely halfway through before rosemary nichols is called upon to parade around in bra panties and one yes one stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation still it's an interesting time capsule even if the appalling fashion sense of peter character which amazingly degenerated even further in the spin off series jason king should definitely have remained buried
<START> yah i know it has the name sinatra in the title so how bad can it be well it's bad trust me i rented this thinking it was some movie i missed in the theaters it's not it's some garbage movie made by the folks at showtime cable station geez these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want it's not good i am as big a sinatra fan as any sane man but this movie was just dumb boring dull unfunny uninteresting the only redeeming quality is that assuming they did stick to the facts you do learn about what happened to the captors of frank jr otherwise it's just a stupid film
<START> okay so i don't understand why people are getting so aggravated over this movie so i thought it was going to be the usual amanda bynes movie but it wasn't it was great br br okay okay so the acting wasn't the best but i thought the performances were still overall great also you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie in other movies that have surprisingly won awards where the actors didn't like working on the film you could tell all of the actors had chemistry and that also showed br br a ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have yah so they're not perfect get over it they are actors not soccer players i have been playing soccer for my whole life and trust me it is hard to learn so stop ripping on the level of skills they have br br i thought this movie was going to be stupid but it was really funny the way amanda bynes and channing tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny i found myself laughing a lot in this movie br br overall i love it
<START> having seen the original when i was 13 and yes i was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting i was excited to see this remake br br camilla bell did a great job as jill johnson and the fact that a teen horror flick could be made in the year 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and gore made it even that much stronger of a film i had a great time trying not to chew my fingernails off br br this film won't win anyone an oscar but it is entertaining and worth the matinÃ©e price ticket i bought to see it i think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake and then determine to never babysit again br br all i can say is i'm glad i'm too old to babysit there's just something about being in a dark creepy house with sleeping kids that makes this movie classic no blood no gore just good psychological fun winner
<START> the guidelines state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines that is the only reason i am saying anything more about because after all my one line summary really says everything there is to say there is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining in this film
<START> i found the film don't look in the basement to be very good with some great characters in it it is about a young psychiatric nurse called nurse charlotte beale rosie who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including dr geraldine masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital dr stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axe br br my favourite characters in the film are mrs reah macadams a very funny little old lady allison who is a nymphomaniac and sam bill a young black guy who goes around all day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film i know that it was on the 'video nasties' list back in the 80's but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it it did have some disturbing senses in it great film recommended
<START> an astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien outlaws this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv installment comes along as a positive birth fantasy the individual characters in conflict at the beginning of the series have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last most of the action takes place inside the womb of the living space ship who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship while science fiction stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies watch the 'alien' movies for example especially the fourth part 'resurrection' this comes as a surprise also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human and alien body one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences while being exposed to sunlight the crew even has to go to the toilet wouldn't that be impossible in 'star trek'
