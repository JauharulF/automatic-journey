<START> not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal br br there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off buster's physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the 27 minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero br br earlier it's a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later it's big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his best br br it's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares it's buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
<START> may contain spoilers br br i had very high expectations for this film based on the trailer i knew a bit about the real ed gein so i figured this was a medium budget hollywood version of the real events man was i wrong br br first the writing apparently came from an eight grader who barely knew anything about ed's history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes the movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of ed and his relationship with his mother not to mention what the real police found in his house and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set likewise all of the male characters seem to be ad libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie i'm not exaggerating br br don't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie seriously who the hell directed this this movie is supposed to take place around 1957 but the cops are carrying modern side handled some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from and when the cop gets to a he 9 1 1 didn't exist back then also ed was a small guy scary like anthony character in psycho who was supposedly based on real life ed not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in men in black br br another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned 3 building set because of the clever camera angles you never see any actual town and the interior of the sets looked like old long abandoned shacks pop a cash register on a saw horse and bam instant hardware store br br i'm usually pretty forgiving of low budget horror films but this one just begs for it all you had to do was include most of the real events even embellish them pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones and for pete's sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while my advice google ed gein you'll be far more entertained
<START> an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all where is anthony mann the director of such classics as el cid the naked spur or the man from laramie br br there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds lovingly filmed the story is very trite and almost completely devoid of dramatization the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june choice for the wife imho totally misses the point with her less than attractive look her hoarse voice she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed at the time women were barefoot and pregnant there 's not one single woman among the base staff even in the desk jobs all they had to do was worrying about their who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear but in 1955 it was not hard to guess it br br one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made
<START> i finally have seen the real reason why peter boyle became famous it wasn't being the monster in young frankenstein or being cranky frank barone on everybody loves raymond for younger people who only know him from tv give this film a try it makes frank look like a saint br br joe is boyle in his finest acting role and as someone mentioned most likely gave the inspiration for archie bunker on all in the family i think boyle even went back to joe a little to play frank i say this because i noticed the basement of both joe frank barone look similar br br i knew nothing of this movie when i checked it out of the library i just knew boyle and susan sarandon were featured yes susan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role a young hippie wanna be who escapes her parents home and lives with the ultimate lost in a drug induced haze hippie who also sells as much as he buys br br after a near fatal over dose on too many pills she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her things her mother wont go into the smelly run down apartment but her father does while dad gathers up her things her boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we will later hear joe say he'd like to do to a hippie br br joe is shooting his mouth off about how he hates different cultures races hippies and a laundry list of others when he says i'd really like to kill one of them the father trying to look like he's kidding says i just did joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny br br later when the police are at the scene and the story is in the paper joe realizes he wasn't kidding instead of nailing the rich guy for money through blackmail he actually kind of does blackmail him by just wanting him and his wife to get to know him and his wife long story short their association is awkward but after sarandon gets wind of what her father has done the bottom is at risk of falling out br br how this all plays out in the end you'll have to watch for yourself although it's over 35 years ago the ending is something you wont expect unless you've seen the film before of course again i recommend it mostly for those who haven't seen it br br 10 stars for boyle not just playing someone completely opposite his nature but for what will show others that he was more than just a tv and movie comedy actor end
<START> the film disappointed me for many reasons first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well built but did only feature a marginal role then the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation the middle eastern setting man with family meets new girl overseas karaoke bar the camera movements and the imagery all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural it is not i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film the female main actress is awful did she play the in minority report and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes r rated just for this this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore
<START> cuba gooding jr and ed harris are touching this movie is really surprising it was enjoyable from start to finish br br the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team br br
<START> i had the privilege of attending the uk premier of inglorious basterds this evening having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films c'mon lets be honest self indulgence is his middle name br br i was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one the film is rich with interesting dialogue perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination br br the crowning glory of this film though lies with christoph waltz whom no fault or error can be found he manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite theatrical couldn't think of a better word he definitely deserved his prize at cannes and is heading for an oscar no doubt hoping to see him in something again soon
<START> i was supremely disappointed with this one having just read the wonderful oscar wilde story i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen well there was none this version played like a condensed dumbed down reader's digest movie not only did it feel rushed it was cheapened and needlessly re written major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen especially on what may very well have been a limited tv budget but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way i thoroughly recommend reading wilde's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors but i cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty
<START> this is the final episode we deserved at the end of the last season things were left in a 'life goes on' mood which was hardly the wrap up that this realistic series deserved while not a happy show this series was always one that made you think a rare thing on television and this is no exception 'is death justified by reasoning ' 'are morals reflective of society or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ' 'what is a just death and can it exist ' all of these questions and more are posed by the writers of this show every week and this is their final thesis fine acting great writing wonderful camera work brilliant editing clean direction if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran then get a hold on a copy somehow if you never watched the series when it ran then this will stand up on its own but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons this is very satisfying viewing
<START> i bought a dvd collection 9 movies for 10 euros where this one was included it turned out to be the uncut version whatever that means beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange the soft sex scene it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts after around 2 minutes i had an expression on my face which fitted the term quite perfectly 7 5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits at this point the term breasts is a bad choice is far beyond from entertainment br br the rest of the movie was more like people aren't that stupid are they br br lucky me the dvd was scratched and i got my money back
<START> yes my summary just about tells it all br br if you haven't watched this try it but not for pleasure for studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct family oriented and cool at the same time br br the men always think they know everything are stupid and finally loose to the magnificent women etc this is especially offensive when all the characters are just as terrible and stereotypic i mean ok cody was funny one time or another but unlike other stupid characters tm like woody in cheers or joey in friends he doesn't get good lines his stupidity is cast in a way which gets quite annoying after a while br br the family morale is awful everything for the family mother and father are supreme dictators who inbetween severe punishing and old fashioned parenting constantly say they love their kids and then of course in the end the kids love them back barf br br and there's always a tender spot like that squeezed into the action where american c tm morale lessons are forced upon the viewers about sex in a mature you can't have sex before you're 18 kind of way or drugs even church habits are thoroughly described here the whole concept is directly sickening all made in a half hearted way to make money if there are people like karen and frank out there please lock them up and the key br br so with themes ranging as far as revolting religious propaganda i think it's fair to conclude as i did in my subject
<START> both the book and the film are excellent in their own right they do differ slightly but that enhances and not detracts from what is an excellent script and acting the historical atmosphere the young girl looking for love the amazing background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of london early twentieth century make this an exceptional movie andrew davies as the scriptwriter excels himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity rachael sterling and hawes are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best the rest of the cast are very good if there was higher than 10 out of 10 i would give it
<START> i was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary the content is poorly produced very poor quality video and especially awful audio there's extremely little about how bruce haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music the interviews of people who knew bruce haack are ad hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo jumbo too much yak and not enough haack although i have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span even for slow and or difficult subject matter i fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts i slept through if you watch this make sure that you are set up before viewing like alex in a clockwork orange bruce haack deserves much better than this shame on the producer and director
<START> tandem is an odd slice in the japanese pink genre as it has the requisite sex scenes and misogynistic tone that is all but required for these types of films but also throws in a disjointed drama dark comedy storyline that seems like it'd have been better suited for a different type of film Â  br br the film starts with two lone guys at a restaurant each daydreaming about a previous sexual encounter one is a mutual subway groping the other a pretty typical for this type of film semi rape scenario the two pervs meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette they hang out for an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex lives the film is inter cut with flashback scenes of both of the men's interactions with the women that are central in their lives the two men have a falling out and the film ends on a weird but predictable note Â  br br i really don't know what to make of tandem it sorta comes off as a soft core couple' type of anti buddy film but doesn't really explore the subject matter to any satisfying degree there's also not much of the typical extreme sleaziness often so prevalent in these types of films so i can't really figure out what the point was i also cant quite tell if the film was supposed to be funny depressing or both Â i think that tandem could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark comedy edge but as a soft core sex film that tries to be too 'smart' for its own good it just doesn't work Â  can't say i hated this one but can't say there's anything notable about it either 4 10Â 
<START> looking for something shocking okay fine the imagery is that that's about it this film attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being annoying i am not quite sure if the director's purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore sex and violence i am thinking that it was probably the first but in the failed attempt it simply ended up to be a piece of artsy garbage with lots of blood some obnoxious characters and an over reliance on religious symbolism if you're looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphor have at it if you are looking for a gore flick that will make you queasy and uncomfortable here you go if you are looking for a film that will irritate you to no end because you realize that in the end the message was stupid the movie was stupid and you will never get those minutes of your life back this is surely the film for you
