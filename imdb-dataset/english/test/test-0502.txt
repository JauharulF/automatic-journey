<START> i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i can't understand why geena outdoes arnold as an action hero in this film geena is an ex cia assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else especially when someone tries to kill her it seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does she hires samuel l jackson who is a former police officer together they form a pair that is as entertaining as mel gibson danny glover when geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song she's not there playing in the background what follows is geena and samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive all through the rest of the film geena has to decide who she really is the killing unfeeling machine the mother schoolteacher with the quiet family life or a combination of both especially since the bad guys grab daughter great action scenes that rank up with any of the die hard movies
<START> i haven't seen ishtar but i did have the misfortune of seeing kevin costner's postman this is worse maybe the absolute worse piece of garbage i have ever seen and if you look at my review for moulin rouge that is saying something bad plot acting was substandard and even wasted even though yes michael keaton has been in some of the worst movies i have ever seen and this movie has no redeeming value to anybody with more than half a brain do not see if you have graduated the 4th grade as you will find this an insult to your intelligence
<START> at 2 in a bathroom at an adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever br br 2 37 is a brutal honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers all intertwined all dealing with their own personal dramas while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix Â the beautiful would be popular girl dealing with body issues the over obsessed with his grades there are several horrors that are as far from main stream as you can get including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past br br the movie is mixed with documentary style interviews from the characters which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative the pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie the young australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular theresa palmer who's heartbreaking performance earned her an afi nomination br br the film is very well shot with terrific direction some scenes are a little hard to watch Â in particular the five minute long suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its' viewers it draws you in right from it's shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom ultimately it's a beautiful made but slightly disturbing look at teenage life
<START> i'm starting to wonder after reading some of the opinions here if i watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts i am forced to the sad conclusion that i have br br this witless wannabee screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest 94 minutes i have spent and one of the most unfunny things i have seen for ages now don't get me wrong i love screwball comedies but this boring set bound drivel falls so far short of the dizzy heights of preston sturges and hawks that it doesn't deserve to mix my metaphors to be thought of in the same breath as those greats writer director charles martin's dialogue is neither witty subtle or interesting and there's so much of it he doesn't know how to end a scene either with some ruthless cutting especially of people exiting rooms and saying goodbye to each other the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and motiveless things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other and move in and out of apartments at a moment's notice only to move what little plot there is forward one moment people are desperately yearning for one person the next they are getting married to someone else having wooed and been wooed off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us oh they're getting married usually after someone has made a faux pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion if we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we the audience might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them as it is the characters just come over looking like selfish petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them br br the sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play the only moments of relief from the tedium are keenan wynn who looks like he has wandered in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around him br br highly avoidable
<START> my reasoning behind viewing this film despite the fact that it was free was more or less out of curiosity slight slight curiosity i wasn't all that familiar with this straight to video biographical account of mr gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon kane hodder in the starring role my emotions turned from not just curiosity but now a glimmer of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of gein would turn out also in the credits among some grim photos of ed's crimes was michael berryman and priscilla okay i thought to myself this may be mildly amusing as the movie started and progressed slowly my microscopic confidence or as i call it micro hope for this movie faded entirely and i was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation as i died a little inside from watching this dung heap hodder who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer inaccurately puts that into play here turning eddie gein from a mild mannered recluse to a hulking full blown killing machine he lurks by night killing cemetery caretakers his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls leaving in a panic as the local sheriff's department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least the deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside or that could have just been the cyanide pill i ingested halfway through this turkey i'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with there is already such an abundance of films pertaining to story that unless the ed gein snuff footage is discovered i don't want to see anymore of these on the shelves if you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out 2001's ed gein aka in the light of the moon
<START> my friend made me sit down and watch this film this is out there material god the devil heaven hell and a restaurant thrown in for good measure br br four guys and a prick who dies when and how is that's the story you'll never guess the ending for this one a skillfully realized little gem of aussie cinema hats of to the team that made this one br br 10 out of 10
<START> this film also known as don't look in the basement is actually not bad it is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but i found this movie pretty entertaining don't get me wrong it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look the story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me i thought the acting which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along it seems like the actors really got into their roles there are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier one who thinks he's a judge an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her the title don't look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film if you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like i do check this out
<START> this dvd usually sells for around 20 i wouldn't pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting but regardless this is a pretty good disc it displays the knot in all their glory with footage from their concerts playing surfacing wait and bleed and scissors among other tracks including the spit it out music video which was apparently banned from mtv br br slipknot for those who don't know is essentially a symphony of the damned nine masked men who display total chaos on stage with machine gun drums squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more for those who've never seen slipknot before i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better deal br br a short though well made show of the knot br br seven out of ten
<START> this movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title the movie was cool despite the fact i hate new ones all of the cast was awesome it has great cast and an awesome plot the main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder neat eh dennis quaid is the man who is d o a in other words dead on arrival he finds help with his friends but everyone is now a suspect character has several hours to find out who poisoned him the movie is quite fast and full of action you can see two other big stars in meg ryan city of angels courage under fire and daniel stern home alone very bad things in supporting roles in this awesome cool remake of a classic movie
<START> russian actress tatiana reminds me so much of the young audrey hepburn and the camera in the cranes are flying seems to love her just as much she is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of world war ii in moscow br br the film is almost poetic in its gorgeous b w cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since i had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on tcm br br it's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime russia she's unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart br br by the end of the story she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation there's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families br br the stylish and striking camera work is what carries the film as well as the honestly played story br br tastefully done but perhaps the english subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over br br summing up easy to see why it won awards at the cannes film festival reminded me in style of another great russian film ballad of a soldier
<START> see i really wanted to enjoy this movie there were moments when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to stand up when my muscles began to tighten but just like a strip tease i was left with no real action no resolution and money missing from my wallet br br and miguel flores apparently don't know the correct recipe for making a horror movie and as such utilized the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot br br this movie is really the shining poltergeist amityville and hellraiser all rolled into one amazing i know but true all the flavors are there you can taste each of them they just don't mix well i'm not gonna go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie in short good cinematography mediocre acting worse dialogue br br the real problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie aside from the resulting confusion is while you can have several plots running at one time you can't have several endings and what does do when he runs into this problem just like a freshman in english 101 you end your story with ellipses the little car vanished into the darkness and the end oooh spooky not really and very anticlimactic the ending left me confused and disappointed almost empty br br take your 10 go rent the shining poltergeist and hellraiser scare the pants off yourself have a great time and forget that the darkness ever existed br br
<START> superb editing outstanding acting especially by and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack this film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady br br the actor portraying the young terrence howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate new york town the audience laughed cried and erupted in applause for the film and its director br br soon to be shown on hbo feb 7 i believe fire up the tivo and enjoy a great story
<START> i was looking forward to this movie i like road trip thrillers i like sex drugs youth action and a great sound track and i was especially interested in taking the movie trip across europe to see if i recognized any of my own travel spots br br from the first scene however this movie was unwatchable what was guy doing driving on the wrong side of the road what could possibly have blown up the van that rolled gracefully down a shallow incline if they're such bad drivers why would they take a delivery job and that's just the first scene not even bad enough to be campy or silly just horrible horrible horrible waste of time move on to something anything else
<START> 2005 the final part of toronto based indian film director deepa mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element 1996 which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel earth' 1998 mehta made her directorial debut with a 24 minute canadian short film 'at 99 a portrait of louise tandy 1975 but it was her canadian feature film about the life of indians living in canada that brought her fame back in east her country by me' 1991 recognition internationally came in the way of 1994 starring bridget fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an oscar in best actress in a leading role category at the age of 80 paving the way for middle aged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old jewish woman in 'driving miss daisy' 1989 late jessica tandy br br dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan a may december friendship was last picture she died the very same year br br international fame followed deepa mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing indian extremist having already explored friendship between two women in in mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women set in modern day india the suburbs of the capital city of new delhi it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother kulbhushan kharbanda having joined a weird hindu sect leads a life of celibacy faithful to his guru of sexless existence the younger brother jaffrey is having an extra marital affair with a chinese woman alice thus both the wives shabana azmi playing the elder brothers wife and nandita das the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way one forced to lead a celibate life thanks to her husband's eccentricities and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more living in a world of in laws and being the only two outsiders in the family having nobody else to confide in the two women fall in the arms of each other thus comes the issue of lesbianism if there were an outside man's shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to confide in their need for each others support is quite obvious it does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context all in all the movie is excellent and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed the key focus isn't lesbianism in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship br br two years later deepa mehta's second installment was the element of mother earth released in india by the name of earth' yet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the hindi language unlike which was made in the english language br br now deepa mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently no doubt it would be just as great as the other two
<START> this show is great not only is a very well written anime show it also reflects things like philosophy science fiction and a little religion it's hilarious at some points and cute for lack of a better term at others actually this may be effect to my lack of experience with japanese anime shows but it is one of the best of its genre i have seen br br i mainly have to give credit to the writers i haven't seen such brilliant scopes of imagination in a television show since the original star trek i hope the writers continue to add strange new characters and give more insight on the already great characters that have been added br br 9 10
