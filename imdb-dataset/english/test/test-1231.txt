<START> subconscious cruelty has to be one of the most disturbing films i've ever seen salo and cannibal holocaust didn't bother me that much but there's a strange psychological element to subconscious cruelty this film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs repulsive at times yes but its visual flair can be compared to avant gard directors such as alejandro jodorowsky dario argento dusan makavejev and david lynch take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by fulci and you might be able to guess what you're in for br br the film is divided into 4 parts the first part the eye is real short a narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an eyeball is pulled out the second part human larvae is kind of like the film eraserhead but with incest it deals with a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister where's when you need him the third part is my absolute favorite it reminds me of begotten and jame's broughton's 1972 short film in this segment people have sex with the earth men hump bloody holes in the ground girls masturbate with tree branches the branches bleed when broken watch in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman's vagina these people really know how to get in touch with nature br br the last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography this part of the film made me think of jodorowsky's the holy mountain sweet movie and cannibal holocaust i've never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed a business man gets his privates pulled apart by fishhooks yuck and ouch two women urinate on a christ figure and proceed to eat him like communion bread and him with a tree branch poor guy the last part was so extreme that if i ever watch the film again i'll have close my eyes or slightly fast forward and mitch davis are obviously very talented to think they did this project in there early 20's hussein went on to direct the tarkovsky influenced ascension 2002 which is a much better film and he co write the screenplay for nacho after dark horror masterpiece the abandoned subconscious cruelty is a fascinating and unsettling journey with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds well sort of
<START> i know i'm human and if you were all these things then you'd just attack me right now so some of you are still human this thing doesn't want to show itself it wants to hide inside an imitation it'll fight if it has to but it's vulnerable out in the open if it takes us over then it has no more enemies nobody left to kill it and then it's won br br john carpenter's the thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made Â fast clever and purely exciting from start to finish this is how all movies of the genre should be made br br taking place in the antarctic in 1982 the movie focuses specifically on a group of american scientists we are given no introduction to their mission but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy norwegians appears at their base camp chasing an escaped dog the norwegians are killed and the dog finds its way into the colony which is when things really start to get crazy br br it is soon made quite clear that the dog is actually a shape shifting alien organism which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims Â in other words it begins to eat the americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemies br br the pack of scientists led by macready kurt russell begin to fight for their own survival using wits instead of brawn if the thing is indeed amongst them then how are they to go about revealing it how many things are there how can the thing be killed or can it be destroyed at all br br the creature's origins in the film are explained easily thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to earth and was frozen in the antarctic ice the thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice by the norwegians who unknowingly released it from its natural prison br br the thing the movie itself is similar to ridley scott's iconic alien 1979 many comparisons have been made Â the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one by one however the thing Â for all practical purposes Â came first br br based on the famous short story who goes there by john w campbell jr writing under pseudonym as don a stuart the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by howard hawks and christian the result was the thing from another world an classic but to be fair it bore little resemblance to the short story and carpenter's remake does it more justice br br the idea of the thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great and is the most vital link to the short story in 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape shifting organism but thirty one years brought many advances in sfx br br creature effects artist rob bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore fest into a startlingly frightening and realistic mess of blood and fear the thing although never actually taking one specific form is constantly seen in a morphing stage and the effects are simply superb they still pack a punch twenty two years later br br ennio morricone's score nominated for a razzie award at the time is a bit too electronic and tinny but nevertheless haunting when used correctly br br from the fact that its cast consists entirely of males to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought provoking and untypical conclusions of all time the thing Â by any standards Â is unconventional hollywood at its best it comes as no surprise that at the time of its release the thing performed poorly in theaters and e t Â released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien Â became the higher grossing picture of the two by far br br in the long run however the thing is superior in almost every conceivable way spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th anniversary re release the thing on the other hand has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics Â it is one of the most famous non famous movies ever made br br carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career Â from his amazing assault on precinct 13 1976 to the magnificent halloween 1978 to the disappointing and silly escape from l a 1996 the thing remains his very best motion picture although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most great movies lists the thing is still one of my favorite horror films and Â upon close inspection Â masterfully crafted it is a daring and ingenious thrill ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling Â a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock offs this one at the very least is genuinely unpredictable
<START> delusion is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile this flick which tells of a trio of semi psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the ca desert is amateurish and just plain stupid the film suffers from an awful story a lousy screenplay and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits if the flick has anything at all going for it it's b movie diva rubin's even performance don't waste your time on this turkey d
<START> not high art not even exceptionally innovative but a thoroughly enjoyable movie funny fresh intelligent there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas br br when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick you're comparing a homemade meal with a big mac
<START> this is the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that rocked it rocked hard and yet it also rocked tasty mr meatloaf added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled now that tells you something this filmed rocked even before it started now i don't want to give to much away or be a spoiler but this movie rocked if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself this seems a bit substandard tenacious material it is like i a merely playing badminton with satan what gives then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece for those who would want it better do not know what they want because better would no longer be the d this movie is the d period so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked
<START> i'm a huge space buff and at nearly 44 i've just discovered this flick for the first time i came at it in a roundabout way from space 1999 then ufo i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first live action work what a home run i actually heard about this movie many years ago but never knew what it was called so i'm happy to have found it by accident br br these andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing the execution of the completely believable and realistic looking models the quality of acting etc br br i don't think it looks dated at all let me tell you i'll take good old models over the fake looking cgi crap of today any time seriously most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real they had it down to a science if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real it isn't hard to actually believe it br br also the amount of detail in set designs the beautiful photography the whole look man i wish i could go back to that time they knew how to make great movies in the 60's personally i've lost all interest in hollywood movies today anybody with a budget can do cgi i hate it bring back the models think of all the people that style employed anyway i am ranting if you like good sci fi that's very well done you will do yourself a service by watching this
<START> blackwater valley exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl do i need to describe any more of the plot to you the exorcist and the exorcism of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies classics imo blackwater valley exorcism is not not by a long shot it's certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been from start to finish it has the feel of a made for sci fi channel production it's one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on mystery science theater 3000 or a similar show br br the make up and effects were absolutely laughable the acting was horrendously bad there was not a single performance that didn't lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling oh except maybe for jeffery re animator combs as the sheriff the script wasn't that terrible but it certainly wasn't anything special br br it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room oh there was something i learned from this movie apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room c'mon and if your daughter is possessed don't worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices eat rabbits try to stare you down and put fog machines in their bed other than that there is nothing to worry about apparently she was possessed with a low budget d list demon br br there was none of the ghastly deeds done by a list demons like crucifix intercourse painful body distortions or even projectile vomiting br br totally laughable movie not worth even a discount rental br br 2 out of 10
<START> i tried to love this movie i really did kevin bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10 year old girl whose fantasies of digging to china flying away in a balloon and so on are her way of coping with a dreary existence i admit i did fast forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background okay three or four of those type scenes maybe nine or ten okay okay it was fourteen but i did sit and watch most of them
<START> is the kind of experience one waits an entire lifetime to avoid ranks as one of the worst film directors of all time if however you love bad films see this at all costs
<START> this is an all around superb film a moving experience filled with real life emotion there's lessons to be learned here about love sex work religion and american culture regardless of one's sexual preference br br while this film is also a scathing indictment of the mormon's church of latter day saints belief system any conservative faith could easily take its place but it's a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the mormons in no uncertain terms here's a faith that mandated for generations that believers practice polygamy and these true believers only gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government in order for utah to join the union talk about a unique form of hypocrisy br br the sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly brief there's nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mind br br what this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural to people who are gay as heterosexuality is to people who are straight while love and sex are obviously quite different needs its absolutely beautiful beyond words when both occur at the same time between two adults profound erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts my congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done
<START> this low budget indie film redefines the word blah it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the dictionary defined as nonsense uninteresting dull lifeless the movie redefines the word because i would have to add to those four words pc crap pretentious on a pathetic level and pointless br br the film tries so hard to be hip and in touch with contemporary beautiful people struggling for je ne sais quoi behaviour and thinking do they think there is almost no plot to speak of though there is one to sleep to the phoniest and most politically correct things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young black stud the black street sax player with a penchant for oh so wise council and advice and the fat black psychic isn't it beautiful how the races can get along after all ahhhh in the end the woman reads out poetry which is nothing more than one of her dull dear diary entries she gets a standing ovation although in real life her listeners would have more likely than not dozed off into deep slumber but this movie has little to do with real life even though that is where it's supposed to be happening in real life her poetry reading would have gotten standing only if she had the sense to include the juicy sexual details and then i rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty impatient pink little vagina cheers what's worse the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or screws with someone yet they never have the sense to show her breasts which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess br br the black guy and the blonde who are separated by about a meter in height hook up they look like a cheap variation of rodman and madonna as if the latter two aren't a cheap enough combination already nicole eggert mentioned by howard stern in his miss america book is the blonde stern writes of eggert that she took her implants out yet i believe that when they took her implants out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake for she looks starved here br br the sax player in one scene develops angel like wings he looks like al advertising angel food cakes

<START> this is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70's starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine dressed in 'baby outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard core marine gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of vincent's innocence stealing his 'baby uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway vincent's character whose name is marion takes gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine marion hitch hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell like little town in the local cafÃ© he meets rose who immediately catches his eye staying with parents marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks mr suspects marion and wonders how a marine could still be so innocent the story also brings up the japanese camps as the towns folks go 3 escapees marion is shot accidentally during this hunt but there's still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit i would have preferred a little more drama anyway this captures jmv at the peak of his 70's performances buster and billie baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid 70's were amazingly good jmv performances he was both an action star and a heart throb all at the same time he made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great tv show airwolf he does a very good job in this as quietly observing the way people treat him in his uniform as he travels across the country he must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me but really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with talent and his looks innocence can only be so interesting evil as explored in buster and billie is much more dramatic anyway glynnis o'connor is delightful as rose the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting the outdoor scenes are gorgeous must have been filmed in canada
<START> once again i've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie i actually put my shoes on got in my car burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place after reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing i'm telling you this one's not worth the minuscule kilo spent on lifting one's index finger to switch channels on a tv remote br br i even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell tale signs of a pedigree dog pile these presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a going senile or b is only marginally interested in the film he she is obligated to create i saw similar deterioration with john carpenter's string of ridiculous over the past number of years br br here are a couple of scenes as incriminating evidence the priest is having a disturbing dream supposedly a harbinger of nastiness to come since he seems hell bent on opening the archaeological feature which houses the demon the dream is a goofy collage of disjointed images right out of the twilight stock footage a ticking clock careens through the dream blackness implying what the unfathomable mystery of time big deal a disembodied head painted in demon features with convenience store quality halloween make up flickers back and forth in a convulsive frenzy every time i see this effect a big fat rip off from jacob's ladder it pisses me off this in itself almost instantly discredits a film br br the whole build up of the archaeological dig itself is laughable everything is so obvious so tired and over wrought the only possible response is boredom at one point in the dig the priest comments on finding the statues of angels surrounding a sarcophagus they're all pointing down toward the crypt with their weapons he queries look at these surrounding statues it's as if they are holding something down this is supposed to build tension critical mass but it doesn't even come close how can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of morons having to explain the suspense as you go along the imagery is over done in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion soon thereafter the tomb is decorated with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main another shameless rip off of the keep btw who for crying out loud did the make up effects for this film the blood actually had that pinkish quality one might see in 70's tromaville flicks at this point i became almost convinced that they simply forgot the make up and had to go to wal mart in the interest of time and money br br don't listen to glowing comments on this one i'll be keeping a suspicious eye on schrader too looks like it might be time to hang up his gloves perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle admonition to quit while there's still dignity in memory of films gone by
<START> why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics random hearts directed by the brilliant sydney pollack who has a small role in the film too is another harrison ford vehicle as such it is quite good and entertaining surely anyone who goes to see it has this in mind or read the book which is no better even kristin scott thomas fans myself included knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle even as such the film is satisfying what's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other much higher rated harrison ford vehicles this film is no masterpiece but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe
