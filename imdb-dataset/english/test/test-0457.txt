<START> people call a party line to talk dirty to strangers and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason a deranged somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill usually married men but they don't discriminate a pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun pretending to be older of course one of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her or anyone br br meanwhile a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the victims he's teamed with a female assistant of the district attorney br br nothing too special here richard roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief one of the dirty talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced peanuts character peppermint patty according to the imdb the other died quite young just several years after this movie sad
<START> oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies i don't even remember how many i've seen maybe it sells but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these also the pulling of the kid i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies cellphone scene is also nothing new the of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked i mean it lacked all ok this is for kids 14 16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique we'll let me tell you there's a million of you d this is one of them 3 10 i've seen worse but you won't be missing anything by not seeing this
<START> they actually make a big deal out of a scene in which steven hurdles a 3 foot fence the plot is barely there the acting so to speak is distressing and the action is catastrophically lame this is the worst seagal film ever and that is saying something
<START> we watched this movie in my chemistry class so obviously it had educational value i thought the film did a really good job of intertwining the subjects of the science moral issues and personal experiences of the manhattan project but wasn't exactly focused on strong acting i would recommend this movie for the scientifically inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind fat man and little boy but if the subject of nuclear bombs bores you don't see it
<START> michael caine's character has problems he's a plain insecure man in his mid 40s he's married but his wife doesn't seem to love him anymore he has a poor relationship with his only daughter but his most immediate problem is that a stunningly beautiful young woman played by michelle johnson is pursuing him too ardently kissing him groping him and trying to initiate sex at every opportunity what's the poor fellow to do br br this movie should be taken out of the comedy section and placed under science fiction only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of michelle johnson's character let's see 3 billion men in the world she can pretty much have her pick she goes with an clumsy aging loser this goes beyond a middle aged male fantasy into something so delusional you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily submitted to therapy br br there's not really anything funny here there are some quick attempts at wit from caine who often seems to playing hawkeye pierce more than a new character joseph bologna is like fingernails on a chalkboard michelle johnson is no actress she has one crying scene that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play but she is beautiful and she does take her clothes off so buy the dvd skip to scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest
<START> 35 years after this was made castro still reigns unfortunately we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim witted maniac played by scenery chewing jack palance made it as far as 1960 i stumbled back across this recently and was amused at noticing the incomparable sid haig and b movie favorite paul untouchables among the rebels fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness some of the lines are classic in a did he really say that kind of way ' the other thing i just noticed is that the score and the sound not the dialog are actually excellent the only first rate elements of the entire production so don't watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun
<START> a kooky but funny bit of diversion you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening but each report to earth has it's own little joke pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci fi t v show it's fun to watch sort of in the vein of red dwarf but even more low budget for someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent because they've been moved up the ladder of command because the other officers died also the main guys are from the laundry corps which is why they have laundry in everything if you like red dwarf you'll probably like this slightly different t v concept in that all you see is the report each day br br it would be better if this were explained more not just in the very beginning of the first episode but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in red dwarf too if you hadn't been told
<START> i saw this movie today on the big screen and i can honestly not believe some of the comments made by people on here i was really hoping to be touched by this film but wasn't br br i'm ex australian army and very patriotic towards this great country but i feel this movie no way does justice for us and those soldier who fought at this battle br br the movie is poorly filmed i thought the acting was terrible they were not believable and they didn't give me any reason for me to care about them people are saying this movie was graphic there were a couple of graphic scenes but i found most part very weak the war scenes were very short and only last a couple of minutes br br overall a weak film that doesn't do these soldiers any justice
<START> the film's title makes it sound like a porno but it's not even a sex comedy instead hot summer in barefoot county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners the moonshine though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly the film is very tame it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating what's more the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is sooooo amateurish this film was probably intended for the drive in crowd but it's unlikely that it satisfied them even in 1974
<START> this was a crappy miserably acted movie based on sublimated male fantasies a shame that it was based in texas an otherwise excellent state i would recommend this movie to no one and wish that it had never entered my consciousness as i am now so irritated that i wasted my brain cells even paying the slightest attention to it
<START> not only was this movie better than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen br br looking at the top 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to 2 br br i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn't mind i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again
<START> let's get one thing straight this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale but out of the bad movie scale this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and by everyone else br br i went in with one promise from the movie that there will be snakes on a train and it delivers br br the gore itself is really good and the characters have awesome roles come on it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs even a electrical engineer getting his pimp on you get to see some topless nudity explosions snakes gore and a mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face as i mentioned and many others have the movie pacing is a bit off but respectable nonetheless br br movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie br br it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock down or boa vs python but those are some big shoes to fill br br a solid 7 out of 10
<START> it's a beautiful film the scenes are well pictured anne revere 's dialogs are really well written and inspiring the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches makes it great and wonderful br br mickey rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses br br elizabeth taylor looks very pretty her scenes in the film are inherently poetic the way camera follows her and the way the music make you feel make every scene of her ethereally beautiful br br this movie has great spirit and a beloved cherished classic br br angela lansbury is quite amusing in her role though unrecognizable if you have seen her in role of 'm' in 'the manchurian candidate' br br donald crisp has done his father's role full justice and the script provides him with ample stuff to justify his role br br its a very nice film and a must watch for family and children an evergreen christmas favorite
<START> to tell you the truth i do not speak tamil and i did not understand the film my good tamil friend wow what a long name explained every thing to me what a great movie after watching this movie i felt i should have watched many more movies from tollywood tamil film industry the war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful the actress what a beauty give her an award for best looking someone ding ding ding come on i smell a oscar winner i didnt understand the songs but they were excellent mani is a great director and i hope his next film was a success
<START> i found this movie on netflix and had to add it to my queue i wasn't disappointed when i got it as it's just as funny now as when i saw it at a local drive in theater back then br br it builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across america on the honky tonk freeway america on wheels this was a strange comedic role for william devane as i remember him as kennedy in the 1974 tv film the missiles of october and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he did br br it reminds me a bit of dick van dyke in cold where van dyke played the local minister role as mayor minister and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and real br br howard hessman and teri garr as the spoiled family in the rv was on target for the time as well anyone who has traveled across country with small children are we there yet will appreciate those scenes br br the scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town i grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns it's sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive used zoo animals anyone br br all in all it's a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at america during the early 80's well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer
