<START> i do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking by making the same type of clichÃ©d film over and over where the bad guys bad girls in this case win weak acting and very predictable nothing original about it this same movie has been made over and over again not different from goodbye lover 1989 slow burn 2005 or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending there are a lot of holes in the movie too it is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming or perhaps they ran out of ideas but do not waste your time with this one it will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it
<START> just watched it then it is pretty damn awesome the fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool it's totally like a video game in parts with some amazing hand to hand combat in there br br this film is for the fans to those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends gather again and devote your time besides this ominous opening the story was not very hard to follow and ihave never played a final fantasy game i think it pays to be familiar with role playing games in general knowledge of the genre kinda helps you grasp some of it better i think though that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you it's quite easy to understand there is a lot that isn't explicitly explained and if you demand that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated br br watching the film is like being dropped into the middle of some grand saga and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible i like that approach you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through but like i said just be accepting if a weird red lion thing that talks turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names and the other characters just say he's an old friend accept it and move on you don't need a biopic flashback or a tell all sit me down you are an observer here of something beyond your experience and br br so fantastic graphics and animation great voice acting cool video game styled music involving story and characters and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see in a while it's worth seeing and while it is for the fans it is perfectly accessible for people like me that have never played the games
<START> consider i know all action hero is lighting a cigarette in the darkness while tries to hide seek the bad guys probably to give a signal light to say here i am coming br br that's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at i think the movie should in the comedy category br br awful directing awful script bad acting cheap special effects they used a tunnel so they can hide there acting in darkness br br 3 out of 10 that also for making me laugh looking at those pathetic mistakes
<START> live together die alone is divided into three main story lines and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode so when you put all of them together you have a great 3 episode it was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character desmond who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point but it worked his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch both informative about the past of the island the swan station itself and honestly moving desmond and penny seem magically connected to each other even when they are on opposite ends of the world and both characters are beautifully acted it's hard not to cry when desmond reads penny's letter the action inside the hatch is edge of your seat tense as locke is determined not to allow the button to get pushed again convinced it was all just a psychological experiment desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision and eko is locked outside and tries desperately to get back in the melting of the clock and locke's i was wrong are unforgettable moments the outside action has jack kate sawyer and hurley captured by the others due to michael's betrayal after they make a puzzling discovery connected to the pearl and henry gale 's game changing return as the others' leader even the least important plot line sayid jin and sun sailing to the beach where the others are supposedly camping contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show the giant statue that's almost entirely missing except for a foot with four toes in short emotion history mythology adventure suspense the threat of annihilation a ray of hope a classic lost episode 1 2 out of 4
<START> for those too young to remember or too old to have been part of the hype the michael jackson fad in the early to mid 80's was at a fever pitch like the hype about titanic except this just didn't let up every song every video every word uttered by michael was important nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the beatles br br i remember seeing this video for the first time at a roller skating rink everyone stopped skating there was no question as to whether you were a michael jackson fan or not you were everyone crowded around the projection screen and watched the video br br this is probably one of the longest music videos ever made and definitely the best it perpetually gets 2 on the annual mtv top 100 videos 1 is always the flavor of the month and somehow whatever was 1 of all time slips past 2 to make way for the new 1 go figure and thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself br br if you ever get the chance you must watch the video not just the excerpts shown on mtv or vh1 if necessary you should search out making of thriller at a video rental store hey your parents probably made you watch beatles and woodstock footage because it was important well this is important too
<START> a hilariously funny movie of course u gotta have a sense of humour to be able to appreciate it the music is excellent reminded me of 50 60's hindi music which is a rarity nowadays worth the go check it out
<START> no real plot no character development no scorcese level direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as borat sure the ending drags a bit but if cameo didn't crack you up you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach i dare you not to laugh br br if you can pull the ten foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie you'll be glad you did keep it real
<START> i will be honest and say i gave up on watching it somewhere mid way and then fast forward with a few breaks then i came back here and read many of the reviews already made br br maybe is just me and i can not help it but this cartoon to north american society seems to have a purpose of lets save them from themselves and iraq comes to mind right away it seems to me that this is a justification or part of for another invasion with good intentions br br the lady to me seems a self indulged person and i frankly got annoyed at her portrait of trying to raise pity and feel for her well in this case this could never happen because just like a history teacher has already mentioned here i need to know how come her family was so wealthy above average manage to keep that were they playing both sides maybe and send her to paris now if this would have been made after a poor girl's biography i could see myself having certain emotions but as it stands its release timing this is just pure propaganda movie even worse since its cartoon it overplays the soft side of too well for its own good in order to possibly be taken serious br br besides there are those clichÃ©s regarding gays well a woman that fights toward winning her rights should not have at least some compassion for the underdogs of society just like her the message is obviously self indulgent from the view of a ruling class member br br i only give it 2 stars because its production and related stuff a propaganda movie obviously has interests in convincing manipulating my thoughts and therefore generally is well done appealing to certain visual emotions that i can not deny i might have as well
<START> footprints certainly isn't your average run of the mill giallo and that's no bad thing unlike his previous effort the fifth cord which was your 'classic' giallo luigi film almost all of the giallo trademarks and instead of murder the focus is very on psychological mystery it's obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon things don't get any clearer after that as the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of alice a troubled woman alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon which have apparently come from a viewing of a film called on the moon' after several things go wrong for her alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named upon her arrival she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her alice also meets a young red headed girl who also seems to already know her the girl tells alice she looks exactly like nicole except nicer and with shorter hair br br the fact that footprints doesn't feature much in the way of sex murder and other giallo trademarks puts it somewhat on the back foot with it's primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this film aren't going to get what they were expecting or probably wanted but on the other hand footprints commands respect for the fact that it doesn't just follow on from what went before it by 1975 the giallo had started to lose it's popularity and many of the films coming out around this period with a few very notable exceptions were merely retreads of what came before so luigi would have been taking a big chance on this film florinda bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role and the fact that she's not the prettiest giallo heroine isn't really important the mystery builds nicely throughout and while it can become a little turgid at times footprints is generally speaking intriguing for the duration it probably won't come as a surprise to many once they get there that the ending doesn't make much sense and doesn't really clear anything up but it nicely adds to the bizarre cult value of the film and all in all i give footprints a thumbs up
<START> this is a very very odd film one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self importance additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life br br later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head oddly this is only half way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor's novels one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them br br see this weird film it's amazingly compelling and not like anything i've ever seen before
<START> a colleague from work told me to watch this movie since he considered this movie to be one of the best movies ever so i did watch it first i have to admit that i dislike mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning br br and this is the point why i dislike this movie it doesn't have any meaning it's just a combination of funny stupid boring entertaining absurd and thrilling pieces br br at first i thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller as the german packaging read but the movie was too mysterious for me br br david lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images but the composition tastes to me as awfull as a combination of milk with beer both for themselves are pretty good but together
<START> if it weren't for the editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger it would be easy to mistake this low budget snoozer for a sci fi channel pilot the plot about the government's attempts to destroy a group of it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero himself gifted in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge alas the movie is talky boring predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects top billed louis gossett jr has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces he walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little
<START> this is probably one of the best portuguese movies i ever saw i absolutely enjoyed the plot because by the way the story was developing you would get more involved on how their world was really upside down there is just only one part that doesn't really seem to fit in the movie which is the girls' strip it does not add anything important to the story it looks like it's just there for a men entertaining purpose the ending is a bit unexpected though at the same time somewhat expected if you don't understand then follow me after so many strange occurrences the viewer is so used to oddities that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships like and sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie but most of all sorte nula is a movie that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious laugh your head off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes when you turn your back away from something for all that i rate it 8 10
<START> i enjoyed the acting in this movie except for the sister she reminded me of janice on friends i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious br br my main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother in law the guy falling out of the exploding car maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital maybe then i could have gone for the ending i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene mainly the brother in law he was such a pain in the ass anyway or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute i could have even bought into the brother in law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films br br it is worth watching again and as i always say it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author
<START> being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film street fighter ii the animated movie i was really looking forward to this one br br however it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose most of the characters i could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superior br br there are some good points however the animation is superb
