<START> i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger seeing it as an adult it seemed almost comical owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties there is a certain gritty unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed the narrator says something like perhaps in that moment for the only time in her life ma barker became a real mother this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos as ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed but instead it provokes laughter a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days gangster movie buffs might enjoy it but more as a curiosity than a real movie
<START> this is your typical junk comedy br br there are almost no laughs no genuine moments no memorable lines no scenes where you think to yourself that was clever nothing the plot is embarrassingly bad br br it's ugly to look at and boring as hell there is no substance here this movie has nothing it doesn't matter if was in this or not a crap movie is a crap movie no matter who's involved br br also david spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie tv show that he's in br br this movie was dead on arrival there is no life here no fun no intelligence there are plenty of other dumb comedies more enjoyable that this one this film is just pathetic br br 2 10
<START> director screenwriter diane english's 2008 update of george cukor's 1939 mgm classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor based on clare booth shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered manhattan socialites the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake instead because of english's thematic overreach the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit what's more the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom level stereotypes in this movie and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's to add insult to injury the recent big screen adaptation of hbo's sex and the city did this sort of sorority style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs br br the skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy mary haines who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a wall street financial wizard like sex and the city she is surrounded by three best friends sylvie fowler a successful cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of miranda priestly in the devil wears prada yet another film this echoes pregnant edie cohen representing the stay at home wife and alex fisher a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique through a mouthy manicurist they find out mary's husband is having an affair with man eater crystal allen a perfume girl at saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress the rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie br br looking strangely youthful at 47 meg ryan seems to play mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with when harry met sally and sleepless in seattle it's not that she isn't age appropriate here but her familiar seems at odds with the character's passive nature annette bening fares somewhat better in the scene stealing rosalind russell role of sylvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely poor eva mendes has to play crystal as a shallow transparent shopgirl versus the smart hard edged cookie joan crawford got to play debra messing and jada pinkett smith are way to the sidelines as edie and alex respectively much better are candice bergen as mary's savvy supportive mother and cloris leachman as the non nonsense housekeeper br br probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release the 2008 dvd doesn't have a robust set of extras there are two deleted scenes one with crystal and her friends having a girls' night in as a contrast to mary's elaborate garden party and the other an extension of bette midler's cameo as a multi married hollywood agent counseling mary during a late night at a yoga camp two featurettes round out the extras the women the legacy about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play and the women behind the women which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about female self empowerment and self image the irony is that this version of the women directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women
<START> this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other 300 people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i can't imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining i feel like 100 minutes of my life were just wasted
<START> this movie was a very good universal monster movie it once again stars lon chaney as the wolfman and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster oh yeah that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula i like every actor in this movie i especially liked onslow stevens as dr it's spelled with 2 i thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like talbot was one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr is in deep thought as he changes everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes that's the only reason why i didn't want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein if his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him in this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with dracula's giving him his jekyll and hyde curse i hate john carradine and i don't think he should have ever played dracula i didn't mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there john carradine thought he was so high and mighty they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set i don't have to take this from you i've done shakespeare john carradine wasn't dracula and he never will be sorry john bela lugosi is the one and only dracula thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for abbott and costello meet frankenstein br br don't miss this movie it doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other this is a very good addition to the monster movies if you're a collector be sure not to leave this one out br br
<START> being a fan of marlene dietrich's films i was very anxious to see this documentary i also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics that should have tipped me off br br the movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated you don't even see dietrich she is heard in the background discussing her movies and this video she does almost nothing but complain about everything what a drag br br the filmmaker maximilian schell constantly complains himself and pleads with her to be on camera all to no avail she just keeps refusing to cooperate after awhile this sort of thing gets really tiring with her attitude why would schell continue with this project he should have just told the prima donna to shove it br br regardless of what you read do not waste your time with this
<START> first off let me say if you haven't enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years van damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but in my opinion it's worth watching it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run good fun stuff
<START> in order to describe what's seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some spoilers so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised don't read this br br i liked everything about this movie except the plot and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential it is well acted if a bit slow moving and the camera work and portland scenes are exquisite for a low budget unpretentious picture the dialog is very good br br mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a company selling insurance his high school buddy berkeley is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that mason is quite obviously mentally ill mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler his visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good looking women in his past and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women he meets a perky pretty girl named amber and he sketches her in his notebook she takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait he sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state almost becoming halfway human then something goes wrong amber finds with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder she becomes frightened and pulls away we are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge his behavior becomes more erratic br br this is the setup for the revelation in order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong i have to explain what happens another spoiler warning in order for this plot to work we have believe that amber a really outgoing pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who at least at the beginning of their friendship has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesn't speak at all he's way beyond nerdy he appears on the verge of total catatonia yes i know girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos but usually the charles manson type or punk rockers guys with some kind of evil manic energy mason is practically a zombie he's hardly there at all any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him it is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him moreover there is no credible reason for berkeley to indulge the crazy mason that just isn't believable either br br but wait there's a revelation amber fails to show up at berkeley's house for christmas dinner where mason is expecting her and berkeley his old buddy has to tell him that amber and all his other former girlfriends the ones he drew in his many don't exist at all she and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination he dreamed them up br br well this explains why a normal cute amber would go for mason she's just a figment of his imagination this could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup but alas it's not at this point mason runs back to his apartment and finds amber there he's enraged he kills her but now we are given to understand that amber was in fact real not mason's imaginary girlfriend br br in the end after being given proof that amber actually exists and that mason killed her berkeley has to admit that he was wrong that he misjudged mason this would work if mason had been halfway sane from the beginning but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us we suspected what he was all along and can't understand why berkeley couldn't see it but then we are once again left to wonder if she was real why amber would be attracted to the catatonic mason br br to make the ending worse we are never given to understand whether all the other of mason's girlfriends the ones in the were real or was amber the first real one and if the others were real did he kill them too what did he do with the bodies br br the problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story but this movie is not that
<START> i gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with ingrid bergman lol i really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful even when they are awful because she is in them if it hadn't been her and vivien leigh as it had originally been desired i hear i would have given it a 9 0 simply because i love viv but probably not as much as i love ingrid and any other actress would have made it maybe a 6 it's a good story two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad reminds me a little of gwtw except laced with a more highbrow attitude gary cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film but hey ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be
<START> when hollywood is trying to grasp what an intelligent person is like they fail so miserably finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported genius br br right any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance sure they hang out in bars and pick fights Â it's not like they are generalizing wildly autistic nerds who never have a tan br br plus if you are a genius you know all about math and history and politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them coz these things like all go together n stuff y'know br br plus you walk around with a smirk all the time you are just a smug son of a you know what that's how it is y'all br br and of course you smoke like someone who never smoked before but you smoke coz it's like cool n stuff y'know and you're different that is understood br br and of course you can fight Â you're a bully a bully who finds time to study 10 000 books whenever he doesn't lift weights and whenever he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regimen br br and you date a 30 something college student Â minnie driver well i won't even comment matt damon team america has hit the nail on the head already br br this movie is a daydream of a beavis butthead type student in other words 95 of them yeah that's what i would be like if i was a genius but stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the lives of geniuses
<START> 1983 was the battle of the bonds that year both roger moore and sean connery starred in two separate james bond film the former octopussy was produced by the official makers of the bond films while the later never say never again was produced unofficially by a group led by kevin who held the film rights to thunderball surprisingly enough is the unofficial film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that never say never again is a remake of thunderball br br never say never again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film it all starts with sean connery returning to the play bond for the first time since diamonds are forever connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in diamonds are forever the bond of never say never again is the sleek and dangerous shark of dr no or from russia with love just a few years older connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was the one downside to connery's age is his believability especially when it comes to the ladies of the film let's face it even connery despite being in top physical shape looks as odd as moore when he is bedding women half his age yet despite this believability issue never say never again shows connery in one of his better bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier bond performances br br kim bassinger plays domino in one of her early film roles bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable bassinger holds her own against her co stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well in fact she may well outshine her thunderball counter part played by claudine br br then there's the villain maximilian largo played by klaus maria brandauer brandauer's largo is everything a james bond film villain should be suave charming evil and above all believable none the less brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other bond villains have fallen into by going over the top brandauer plays largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007 br br the excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well barbara carrera makes a fine henchwoman in blush and the screen lights up when she appears max von sydow a nice appearance as though his appearance is more akin to a cameo rowan atkinson makes an appearance as bond's bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film with all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the mi6 staff from edward fox's m who makes for a great contrast to bernard lee pamela salem who make s moneypenny and the icing on the cake with alec wonderful q the supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of bernie casey as felix and gavin o'herlihy as jack who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film br br on top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients from the opening central america sequence to the fight at to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part the film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models explosions and all the things we expect from a bond film irvin kershner then fresh off doing the empire strikes back brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles br br yet this film is far from perfect never say never again is easily one of the most dated of the bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games while technology dates any film after a time this film's heavy reliance on it especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release the script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of thunderball br br yet for its predictability the script for never say never again is pretty good the script sports good dialogue scenes not a single cringe worthy one liner how many of the roger moore era scripts can you say that about some humorous situations and yet is watchable and tense for the most part once you look past he fact that it's a remake there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film br br music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film due to the unofficial status of the film the james bond theme could not be used that said this could have shown with the right composer that a bond score without it could work unfortunately michael score is far from adequate score is totally out of place in a bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works to make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a james bond film br br despite being heavily dated somewhat predicable and having a bad score never say never again is still a good bond film with one of the best casts of any bond film good action sequences good special effects good direction and some terrific dialogue this film proves that unofficial isn't a bad thing in fact it is is better then octopussy and the winner of the battle of the bonds
<START> farscape totally rules in my opinion it's very close to babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series spaceship included the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship br br what i really love and appreciate in is that they don't use cgi for the alien characters or if they do it's unnoticeable they use those lovable crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star wars br br farscape is something you definitely want to look into if you already haven't
<START> i remember my dad hiring these episodes on video my whole family loved them and now that i have moved away from home and have my own life i am trying to share these fabulous jim henson creations with my husband and stepson but as i am starting to find out not everyone is a henson fan which is a pity since it means they will just have to put up with me searching for this series but even though they don't find these interesting i would highly recommend anybody getting hold of the storyteller you will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were ever confronted with these situations
<START> wow i just don't even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful maybe i should start by just saying that during a heated confrontation between the antagonist and protagonist i had to leave the theater because i was laughing so hard yeah the acting really was that bad the acting was not even the worst part though the plot was almost entirely shown in the previews the characters are all grossly underdeveloped the dialogue and dramatic moments are ridiculous the bad guy is a caricature of an out of control power drunk sadist br br but hey the actors are pretty so guess that was supposed to make it all better
<START> wow what a horrible hideous waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be i remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now it's just plain silly not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip off of the exorcist to the point where it was re released at one point under the title the sex the only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by slapping on the claim that the events in the film are real who in their right mind would actually believe such a bold faced lie to make matters even worse there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the rocky horror picture show by throwing a pair of lips on the cover how low could one possibly sink do not be fooled by the false claims blatant lies or title rip off because you will be sorely disappointed if you do
