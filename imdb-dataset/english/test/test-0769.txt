<START> no wonder so many young people have attention deficit disorder it seems that stage dance productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show is there a special emmy category for this feat try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this otherwise completely unwatchable show br br i tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production that was impossible they didn't appear to have any faces just blurs it was just michael face michael bare chest nice sheen michael feet and that patented flatley over the shoulder come hither look repeated infinity squared since he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job i guess that was to be expected one doesn't have to wonder too much as to who his target audience is br br riverdance was a much better production as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience not the catwalk side wings or floor nail perspective if i'm not mistaken i believe sir michael has retired thank god for small blessings
<START> this is a pretty interesting experiment to watch it's the first ever still existing attempt to unite sight with sound it features two men dancing to a violin player possibly william k l dickson himself who is standing next to an edison recording cylinder that is capturing the sound br br the sound and images were not linked together as one yet and it wasn't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together it's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture br br the movie is made by william k l dickson a assistant to thomas edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound the answer he provided was the a kinetoscope basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it so people could watch the moving images with a cylinder phonograph inside of it for the sound this is the first that we know off surviving movie experiments that feature this technique all of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately so the was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound in some cases people could even choose from three sound cylinders featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images only 45 were ever made so you could hardly call the a success also after this experiment focus went off to other cinema techniques mainly regarding movie projectors br br so the experiment itself obviously did not become a success also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released they just couldn't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available it would had been a very expensive job to do so it therefor really isn't the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie making br br 8 10
<START> i would give this a zero if they had that rating fun was no fun at all i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better it did not the others i watched this movie with also agreed the acting was annoying i am tired of jim carey's over the top ham acting the supporting cast was no better while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under the vehicle for this would have been better served another way i actually disliked the leading characters dick and jane so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot a worthless movie and a total waste of time
<START> this is one of chaplin's first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature united artists features more opulent than the mutual films it continues chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front br br there is plenty of slapstick via the limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy and chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree br br by this stage in this career the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves doubtless this was not the case but still it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember albeit from an ironically humorous perspective br br as far as i am concerned familiarity with the entirety of chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles do not delay
<START> wow most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen br br the shift from the early days as a new york based black american phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture and largely west coast based is profiled well br br the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument dexterity rhythm and timing among others and apply them to a new technology with several more variables br br dj comment that he pictures what music must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out seemingly silly at first makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create br br some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip hop culture one film at a time people
<START> i clerk in a video store so i try to see the movies we're about to put out each week i don't have a problem with this in fact i sort of feel it's a privilege not so with this film after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home in my free time and if i'd known there was another hour to be endured i might have given up right then i didn't care about the characters the filming was unremarkable and ford made kissing look like a chore even the score was incongruous and jarring what a waste
<START> when a group of dumb kids including an unlikable racist bitch stay at an old house it awakens four murderous spirits can lash la rue save the day will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display br br the dark power is the kind of really bad horror comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly thing is they didn't release this that doesn't excuse the whole thing as it has a dreadful synthesizer score including bad attempts at native american music and even worse comedy music bad make up effects basically halloween masks and atrocious acting ok the fat guy was alright though everyone else is terrible and la rue a western movie vet seems embarrassed to be there not that i blame him really br br the worst thing though is the comedy aspects sure dumb teens is one thing but when the movie keeps talking about the spirits as if they are the ultimate evil only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying bumbling fools all hope is dashed combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill there is no skill on display here as it all is just stupid and not so dumb it's fun either i mean smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock aren't i dumb dumb br br not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster terrible movie and not even worth a rental
<START> i watched love life on holiday when it was filmed at a film festival in florida it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that wasn't derivative or exploitive a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting but as whole i think love life is a winner a ruby in the dust one for all the family a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words try and see it
<START> considering this film was released 8 years before i was born i don't feel too bad for over looking it for such a long time back in january of 98 though i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin texas the particular theme of films this night was neglected 70's crime films and boy was her right the gravy train or the dion brothers as it appeared this print was an absolute gem wonderful performances quirky characters smart plot hilarious comedy and just an all around great time rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it in the meantime go to an indie video store and hope they have it
<START> hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie although i haven't seen dahmer 2002 i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind i loved this movie just brace yourself for low budget and no blood its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest my favorite line is if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives enjoy
<START> dr stephens michael harvey head of a seriously institute for the insane takes a approach towards the treatment of his patients even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building day and night he pays the price for his forward thinking however when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving br br shortly after this tragic incident nurse charlotte beale rosie arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor's assistant and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner dr geraldine masters annabelle despite being unaware of her deceased predecessor's decision to employ ms beale and not particularly eager to take on new staff dr masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away br br it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital the have taken over the asylum' schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans but s f don't look in the basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters popsicle sucking sam bill judge oliver w cameron gene ross who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases old mrs rhea macadams who recites william creepy poem the fairies and warns charlotte of impending doom cackling loon danny jessie kirby who delights in teasing the other patients harriet camilla carr who thinks her doll is a real baby army nut sergeant hugh and best of all allyson king betty chandler whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love ie she tries to jump any man who goes near her br br this convincingly crazy set of characters plus a bit of gore and nudity reasonable direction from who also gave us the impressive white trash horror scum of the earth and a solid turn from playboy all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker
<START> having read so much negative press on this movie over the years i'd always avoided it but the advent of the cheap public domain dvd encouraged me to finally give it a viewing br br unfortunately it's been transferred from a poor copy the modern prequel shot on tinted stock is blurry and the contrast non existent faces are occasionally difficult to make out having said that the actual story is entertaining and lou comes across as an accomplished actor more so than in many of the boys' movies br br once the movie switches to the 'jack' story the film switches to and i use that term loosely most hues are orange or brown the greens look particularly bad br br dorothy ford as the maid was a big plus for me as i enjoyed her in an early hardy' appearance br br with so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print i'm still happy to give this movie a 7 it gave me a lot of laughs and that's more than the greater majority of comedies i've watched over the decades can manage br br one to watch if you get the chance

<START> usually any movie with steve railsback in the lead is a good movie however this movie does not conform to that opinion lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning reminds me of star trek but is able to pick things up a bit towards the end when london becomes zombie city a horror sci fi mess that is very hard to sit through although the naked vampire is very easy to look at this movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10
<START> this documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be if done so well as this the subject mark is smart funny and very driven and this story of his personal fight to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to harbor an impossible dream see this
