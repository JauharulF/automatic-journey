<START> there have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb the robert taylor film above and beyond flag waving propaganda really if you believe this one you think that the army air corps in the person of paul w ran the entire show the nbc produced gay probably a lot closer to the mark and the bbc tv series oppenheimer with sam waterston in the title role br br fat man and little boy takes the same approach that the bbc series did but widens it it avoids the gee whiz technology of the manhattan project and focuses on human aspects the personalities involved in the work instead of focusing on it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it br br with reservations dwight schultz did a good job as presenting a dreamy ivory tower academic who struggles to relate his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory in the day after trinity it was made clear that oppenheimer viewed himself as a superior being by virtue of his vast wide ranging intellectual prowess in the end that was robert downfall he saw himself as a sort of philosopher king a moral and intellectual superior who could and rightfully should wisely prescribe what was best for the rest of the world re nuclear weapons development and deployment br br unfortunately wisdom doesn't dictate the actions of nations or direction of events on a global scale wisdom doesn't bestow temporal power when it tries to exercise such nonexistent power as found when he opposed the development of the super the hydrogen bomb wisdom is ignored and banished by those who really have the power br br i found myself schultz character in one way his exposes himself too closely and personally to the manhattan project despite the doubts and fears that tore at his intellectual basis the real oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach at the beginning he would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good the ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good and it must be ignored at least until the end of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses clearly did that and it resulted in his controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin and that was a knowledge it could never lose br br while the project went on such considerations had to be pushed aside if he was to maintain his sanity br br because of this ambiguity schultz character comes off as a weak frightened little boy who could never have served as coordinator of rapid rupture as oppenheimer unofficially dubbed his post br br paul newman's take on gen leslie r is fascinating and a bravura performance if possibly a little bit over the top br br was a civil engineer by training but first and foremost he was a soldier and a general to boot he's accustomed to demanding that things go his way intensely driven a foul mouthed spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a hat who reveres his country and isn't too proud to fall on his knees and pray in other words very much like real ie non civil engineer soldiers aka george patton mission not only comes first it is his only consideration feelings and egos be damned except for his own of course br br couldn't admit it but he knew full well that he needed oppenheimer military rank meant nothing in the world of theoretical physicists was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to straddle br br again i have to fault the script on this and for the same reason br br in reality already owned if he didn't would never have been chosen for the post in the first place history tells of many cases where other scientists some as stellar as oppenheimer simply walked away from recruitment efforts at one point was so desperate that he proposed drafting the physicists he needed br br attempts in the film to maneuver and control were unnecessary they only exist here as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly br br michael merriman is a composite of several real characters but they're from a different time frame several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in postwar weapons research br br radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film but one which is imho necessary and pretty accurate people with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences they're all too real br br the main idea that comes across but not strongly enough imho is the big truth of the los experience the scientists who signed on were young idealistic and naive as well as talented most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus to them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets or excessive bureaucratic oversight br br it was not only their brilliance but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb br br there's plenty here to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie just the same if you filter out the hollywood bs there isn't that much of it really this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of manhattan project
<START> there isn't enough space to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of this movie's problems the film looks like it was conceived in the mid eighties and just until it could finally be made in the early nineties the mullet headed hero complete with fashionable miami vice three days shadow beard the ham fisted slams at ronald reagan it would be funny if it didn't take itself so seriously as it is the movie is just pathetic i actually feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine nude scenes in this awful movie
<START> when i was a child this was the movie i watched i think it is a great movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images rainbow is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make the winter go away she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves i love this movie and i think that even adults can enjoy this movie
<START> i think this programme is a load of rubbish all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am bored with it i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show 'tv e g the weak joke the princess and the pea isn't exactly shakespeare is it that had sonia and naomi in stitches i don't see how that is funny i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv licence so this can be shown 4 5 days a week isn't there anything better than this
<START> ui christmas is very korean if you have been to korea or have korean friends you should know what i mean korean are very traditional people they see love very a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world i think that is why this film is so special it is wrong to compare this film with love letter by shunji iwai are very good but could never make one like ui christmas if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself
<START> yes barney is nonsense now but when i was a kid it made perfect sense br br i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it as a child i was mocked because no one could say my name so i changed it ever since i was 4 i've gone by the name tina from barney because i could relate to her being from a different culture i'm 17 now and barney is a huge part of my life my name came from it i cant dis the show i grew up with no matter how stupid it seems now br br i don't care if i get blocked i have nothing more to say they shouldn't make the minimum 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say ok done
<START> for finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams a land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business find love start a new life etc but aku has made this brilliant piece which shows that everything is not so good in finland as well that finland can be just as maa the bad land than any other country it shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives than we in everywhere else that sometimes there's nothing good this movie nicely shows why finland is one of the top suicidal countries it's not easy to live in north cold climate changes us i've become more and more attracted to finnish movies and this one is very good the acting is great as well jasper has become one of the top finnish stars beware of the sex scene if you have little children and a little depression that might come afterwards the movie 8 10
<START> gloria swanson as leila porter is an understandably bored wife workaholic husband elliott dexter as james porter has lost his romance along with his waistline he also smokes cigars in bed eats onions and he can barely remember his own anniversary which is attended by lew cody as van the younger man eyes ms voluptuous figure and flirts unabashedly soon swanson is drawn to mr cody then mr dexter decides to try and get her back who will win br br the three principals are fine with swanson most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn julia faye grabs supporting honors as cody's other interest off screen she tempted director cecil b demille the demille touch is evident especially in an imaginary sequence wherein cody promises swanson br br don't change your husband 1 26 19 cecil b demille gloria swanson elliott dexter lew cody
<START> i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind the trauma the suspense is just amazing i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and relating it to reality movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget those that make you doubt your reality a problem could be the quality but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie br br the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer i just totally loved it so many clues and twitches and puzzles one of the best movies ever hands down
<START> although it has been off the air for 6 years now promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation good cast supporting cast among them richard thomas and ossie davis and crew the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying to hell with it all after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier i think a lot of vietnam era veterans myself included could really relate to thought process in finally deciding on his course of action many of us did precisely the same thing in real life after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left the show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life in those two respects alone i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me
<START> i had looked forward to viewing this movie it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it i was completely disappointed the acting was so overdone the script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one script br br spoilers was any cliche omitted in this movie there was a hit homosexuality prostitution a serial killer a fire numerous godfather wannabees the main character in love with the prostitute cross dressing torture by the police hannibal style mutilations i could go on and on br br line's like the godfather wannabe to the prostitute br br ben i don't want u to work anymore br br ben kim who would pay the rent if i didn't work br br unrealistic scenes we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks br br the only way i can make sense out of this whole movie is if the version i had scene was severely edited from the original i definitely do not recommend it and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so br br
<START> this film tried but ultimately it was a waste of talent it tried to hard to be sexy i'm not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson who will find something besides tv's le femme nikita worthy of her talents i just didn't find even in ms wilson's so called near seduction scene with mrs barkin any real emotion even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work if the sexual elements of wilson's disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart which it didn't even by an ending it didn't deserve neither did the murder element of the plot perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction but i didn't feel for anyone in this movie and without this feeling a movie doesn't work for me if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism there are a least two films on either side of the to check out 1 the pleasure of bound which works well in a noir setting and 2 the more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hell's kitchen called all over me it's a well defined indie from the mid 90's that handles that coming of age issue with feeling not forced sexuality both would be a better rental than mercy which has next to nothing
<START> i have seen this movie maybe a 100 times never grow tired of it i saw this movie the first time when i was 7 years old and it has left a mark in my memories since then its a enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people even in the darkest times i think that this is a must see movie and one of anthony quinn's best performance ever i just wish that the tv channels would send this movie more often it has inspired me in a good way and surly will do that to many others if there is any actor i wanted to meet it would have been anthony quinn there will never be a like of him on the silver screens ever wish that anthony quinn was still alive may god bless his soul
<START> the 1977 animated live action hybrid version of gulliver's travels or rather ' since he only gets as far as didn't get much of a release and it's not too difficult to see why michel legrand comes up with some catchy tunes but they merely inspire lyricist don black to the likes of one simple fact remains no one here suffers from growing pains ' richard harris once again over indulges in his passion for excessive makeup toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he's at least 25 years too old for the role but at least he perhaps inappropriately reduces his larger than life tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering the belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning french children's tv but peter hunt's film is not nearly as bad as it sounds Â the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to max and dave fleischer's 1939 version while a couple of moments of satire do remain although it's definitely aimed at the youngest of children
<START> quitting may be as much about exiting a pre ordained identity as about drug withdrawal as a rural guy coming to beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim br br but what an exceptionally convincing honesty and sensuousness director zhang yang and his actors bring to this journey no clichÃ©s no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims br br jia is in his mid twenties he's a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved the perfect recipe for his enablers soon he's the cool actor idolized by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most fashionable he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf his acting means the arts friends and roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input and his self criticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational self doubt self hatred i didn't know how to act i felt like a phony and to readily available drugs to counter them he says i had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity br br from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittent and doggedly his own solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy the abstract is out and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and high rises of beijing the physicality is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his are very specific he drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in a current circumstance if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night br br central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and tv and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist but he's the only viable guide he knows he even imagines himself as john's son yoko ono and adopts his mother mary as an in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the park hallucinatory and ordeals music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of lennon's influence as showing me a new way in the mental institute the life saving apples resistance nourishment reflect lennon's presence as does need to re hang his hero's poster in his room br br if lennon's influence is father's influence is grounding although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is differences from his son that his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that he's chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions it's this recognizable identity that drives to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans beatles and passivity in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts i acted before were bullshit life is bullshit and to emphatic you are not my father he softly replies why can't a peasant be your father br br under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab he makes some tangible connection to a real not whole self as the long term drug effects so does his old identity indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust integrity his black cloud all his edges soften you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap down incurred for refusing medicine back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back to back fence scene with his musician buddy says of this movie it's a good chance to think about my life and i might add become a new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity
