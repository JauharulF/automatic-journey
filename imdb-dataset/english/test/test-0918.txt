<START> the details in the big trail were so incredible that i felt that the movie was made at the time it represents i have never seen wagons that were so real they were big loaded with accessories and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that was never meant to be seen every speck of dirt every scratch every splinter was there modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across the land or circle to fend off indians the wagons were all real individual vehicles each with its own real team of horses or br br the actors clothing could not have felt more genuine with the exception of john wayne's outfit and marguerite churchill's nice dress the clothes were very common looking tattered or dirty in an authentic looking way many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings all the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted tan br br women of the old west had to be sturdy because there was a lot of work in every scene showing work done by the people of the wagon train women are shown chopping wood hauling logs etc this realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival br br the plot of revenge and romance is played well nothing is overstated or overplayed br br something was lost along the way in the 1930's in hollywood as much as i love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies the big trail manages to feel real above all else the more i see big budget movies of the silent era the more i like them i can think of few movies of the 1930's that i have seen that equal the grandeur of the best of the 1920's if there were home movies made in the days of wagon trains the big trail is what they would look like
<START> this is one of the best non english series i have seen it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crime solving together with a personal aspect that you just don't get in csi the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally interfere additionally the characters all manage to naturally evolve throughout the episodes br br the casting is superb and it was taped all over denmark giving a good example of the highlights that majestic country has to offer unfortunately only 32 episodes were made however they are top notch television here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber
<START> i grew up with the abbott and costello movies a because my dad grew up with them and both our last names are abbott so we owe the a bit of respect i didnt realize the flack this movie and others of theres gets it was a really clasic due it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters but it was sooo funny now what i like about jack and the is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings omg but i like the angle they took on the love story the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money they meet in the jail cell and fall in love they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple so happy ending i dont think that was the orginal version if it was they should have cut it out of this movie but i think it was orginal and i love it but watching it sucks lol also when the movie really kicks in with the giant abbott and costello it is sooooo funny when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming open the door open the door that stuff is really funny and that once joke where jack starts screaming prince prince and all those dogs jump him kinda cheezy but really orginal i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it though i got that africa screams jack and the and i dont mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny and the end is not funny in the least but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh this hard it rocks this movie is really funny i love their style also the chapters suck also the part where jack is climbing the and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed thats pretty funny
<START> if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the villain not be more sympathetic than the victim and this fails miserably it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment ok so the husband is rich and cocky there are worse vices and the cabana boy and wife display plenty the husband is a jerk because he um didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw the cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife he then forces himself on her which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him uh huh the misogynistic inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims what was he thinking
<START> people need to give this show a chance the people who write bad reviews there are very few of them are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes one needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it all of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws they make mistakes but they are realistic mistakes which is an uncommon thing to see on television today also for the most part the acting is superb lauren graham has been snubbed of an emmy for six years now someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves same goes for kelly bishop who plays emily gilmore so perfectly also it's nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it and not be filled with teen angst rory is a smart girl which is also not seen a lot on television today if only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show

<START> bring a box of kleenex to this funny engaging and moving weeper the two leading actors give tour de force performances there was considerable debate afterward about whether they are really disabled they are not i appreciated that for once the filmmakers dared to be politically incorrect by depicting people with severe physical disabilities as fully developed people character flaws and all as a result their believability engages us and makes us grow to like them and care about their conflicts the story structure is formulaic and many of the secondary characters are merely types but the two central characters are so riveting that it doesn't matter br br interesting the original title inside i'm dancing reflects the viewpoint of the character michael while the new title for usa release suggests that rory is the central figure
<START> i originally saw this on its premiere in the uk i was mesmerised by it and it had me in tears all throughout its duration i taped it off the tv for but over the years it's worn out and tv never seem to show it therefore it was a joy to find out that true movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels this time i taped it onto a dvd so i can enjoy it again and again br br lucile fray played magnificently by ann margret discovers she has cancer and that it is terminal her husband has arthritis and although he is loving he is an alcoholic and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone therefore she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies br br the acting is top notch the music beautiful and it has stood the test of time wonderfully it still makes me cry if you ever get the chance you would be silly to miss this it is a wonderful film a must see for everyone

<START> this is total swill if you take the devil's rejects and suck all the good out of it and add a lot of twisted kinky bondage parts a few rape scenes and like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes and you'd get this movie people are calling this a ripoff of the hitcher but i don't see that at all even the worst hitcher ripoffs are still better than this the main problem on display here is that there's really nothing here besides a few of the director's fetishes being showcased like circus exhibits is all you need out of a movie shots of girls being abused and tied up cowering in fear well then rent this movie br br however i'd rather just watch a good movie which this is clearly not the sad thing is there are some really good thrills waiting to be uncovered here but only a few for instance the suspense at the beginning before the bondage nonsense started pretty damn good if you ask me and the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl can't remember names is chilling very brutal in a way challenging even the devil's rejects for unbridled fury how come the rest of the movie can't be that good huh i really need to stop renting stupid crap like this closing message just let this gutter trash die and forget it forever not recommended
<START> jack higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt ridden ira bomber forced into one last job where have i heard that plot before gets a snarky treatment from cult director mike hodges mickey rourke with alarming red hair confesses all to the priest bob hoskins of all people who accidentally witnessed the shooting the rules of the church keep father bob from talking but then rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece they bond at the church organ what really that's the plot alan bates is around as the top dog mobster who's calling the shots literally and he seems to be the only actor who's on to the jokey tone hodges is aiming at bates is all set to do a sort of u k prizzi's honor but no one else including an effortlessly charismatic liam neeson in a supporting role has been informed
<START> if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining it's got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that's hard to do when you consider custer's last stand at the little big horn and it's prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it br br there's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time custer's arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble br br ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custer's first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader hattie mcdaniel i hadn't noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too br br as for flynn it's interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed j e b stuart opposite ronald reagan's depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident but it doesn't come close to that of richard mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's little big man let's just say that one was a bit over the top br br the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer's character when he stated you take glory with you when it's your time to go
