<START> i always thought my father had a second life and was eagerly awaiting the development of 51 birch street when i sat down and viewed it for the first time amazingly this movie's journey took me to places i had not expected and made me rethink assumptions and judgments truly a remarkable personal story told in clever but straightforward manner i especially enjoyed the film maker's use of pulling out the type of his mother's daily diary very effective i read the previous comment and wish to note that the sound was fine when i watched this and suspect either the film was changed somewhat or the theater could have contributed to the poorer quality of sound for the other writer
<START> one of the most macabre depressing yet eye opening docs i've watched in awhile there's no narration or story that's told just a third eye type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in nyc through the seasons watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then clean their needles in the public toilets sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather br br anyone currently in recovery of alcohol drug addition should watch this when they're craving it really shows you to what you could be going back to after seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with br br the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today judging from what is shown in the doc there's no hope for any of them they mention wanting to get better and quit but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying br br this definitely isn't for all audiences i found myself kind of like watching a car accident after i started watching it i just couldn't turn it off i had to keep watching with a dark morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts
<START> last night i am sitting in my tv room beer in hand bowl of pretzels on the tv tray i decide to put the movie monster man into my trusty vcr expecting a fun filled gory crash bash of a movie what do i get instead one of the most silly stupid predictable films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through and what's even worse all during the i use this next phrase loosely sex scene the girl keeps all her clothes on i'll make this summary short sweet mix dude where's my car about a good 1 2 of the film with a very watered down hitcher add a redneck version of the antagonist from i madman as the primary villain finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is it's also utterly predictable throughout the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a horror film is that some of the moments between the 2 guys even though the hero is one major annoying geek the other is a jack black clone are kind of funny just mediocre funny i e like most of snl skits other than that monster man is a monster mess 3 10 this one i'll be handing out at halloween time just hope after the person views it i don't get my house egged or worse
<START> dan burgess is a nice guy he happens to be a christian dan can't get a date with a girl and thinks that all of his friends are having all of the fun he is constantly being bothered by non believers and being made fun of br br dan prays one night and wishes he was never a believer in jesus br br his prayer is answered for one day things get hairy from there an angel appears to dan and explains his prayer is granted br br so all of the impact that dan has had on starting a christian club br br he be friends scot parks and making a difference is erased for one day br br dan's eyes are opened his life really did make a difference
<START> i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form i especially loved david boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy the first part of the movie was light and funny the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic but interesting and it was all downhill from there br br i found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls keira and lisa get out of the blackmail betrayal scot free nary a trace left on their psyche i know the movie the darker ending of the play and i am not saying i missed the murder part but i surely needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and i was left groaning in frustration with the ending it's why i gave it only a 9 br br but definitely an interesting film
<START> this movie tries to say something profound i'm just not sure what it was too much is left unresolved in the end for me to figure out the main point a couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor i don't think the wall was very well developed i never got what was actually going on there when the mother finally unveils it i just couldn't make any connection to the boy's silence what was the point of the boy not talking was he just delusional or did he acquire some sort of power what was the scene with the burnt girl all about another power the boy has or what i don't understand how that developed any character or moved the plot i got the bully bit but what happened to the dog did the dog come back or did mom get rid of fido for good somehow br br there were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use like the radio talk show in the background discussing the iraq war i think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and insecurity the mother and addison were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained i didn't buy the link very much i also found the teacher getting on addison about not saying here for roll call a bit much the mom seeing the doctor was pointless how did it serve the plot was that to show how desperate the mother was getting or was it something about the medicine that i didn't get was that the dad coming back in the last scene or just some guy so did writing on the wall work what happened to the dog
<START> the first in a new style of films for lamas no motorcycles or karate i for one miss them but this is a serious movie he plays a fbi profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone including himself gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street kristen cloke pursues lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending it seems to never come there is always one more layer to the story cloke and lamas start out as the good guys turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes but it's definitely worth the rental price for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar a bag of popcorn and a soft drink you're going to the movies
<START> i saw this movie so long ago but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie ever i cried non stop my mother will not ever watch this movie again because its almost painful to watch anyway apart from that the story isn't exactly complex ann margaret is dying and has to give away her 10 children as if that isn't bad enough it is during the depression and she has to break up the close siblings one by one i guess this was very sad to me because i too am from a very large close knit family and could identify with each child's pain of leaving their mother and siblings br br maybe i am a masochist but i would like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end surprisingly is slightly happy so at least we could smile and sob simultaneously it should come on tv sometime so i can see it again
<START> fred carpenter screened eddie monroe at boston college and judging from the enthusiastic response he has much to be pleased about a taught well done indy impressive for it's big budget look and feel this movie has it all a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending this viewer didn't see it coming excellent performances all around craig morris and jessica were were especially well cast in the leads delivering strong performances and kudos to frank and alex corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it confirmed my belief that some of the best work in film will be coming from the independents and fred carpenter looks to be one of the best
<START> stan laurel it's been noted first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s he certainly demonstrates himself to be an excellent comic actor and performer here in mud and sand a parody of rudolph blood and sand but i think a film like this really works not because laurel was a great satirist but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and scenes laurel can then let loose with his inspired gags without either having to create context or to do without it i watched this the day after watching blood and sand itself it certainly enhanced the experience to know what was being parodied and where br br the scene where laurel's character vaseline if you believe the title cards or if you believe how his name gets written on the chalk board his mother out of money with a two for you two for me trick is funny on its own because it's a great gag but it's extra funny if the viewer is aware how it is taking the air out of extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxuries she desires br br this is the best stan laurel solo work i've seen it's just plain funny even more so if you have had a chance to see the source material
<START> i like arnold and i love the subject matter but this was a very disappointing movie when i first saw the previews they were dark and ominous and arnold's name wasn't even mentioned but i recognized him which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious suspenseful mood that it wasn't just another schwarzenegger action vehicle though i admit most of his are pretty good he had thus far avoided movies with any real religious theme and i was excited i was wrong this is just another action explosion gun fire movie and it's a pretty bad one
<START> it's too bad wants to deny the reality of and clarence brown's purpose in the creating of the story and film of intruder in the dust i suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any southerner to bear and i can understand that but to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate yes to borrow your use of the upper case there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the south get along quite well but to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding sometimes it was only as long as blacks their place' the point of making hernandez character in film and print a somewhat prickly type not warm and fuzzy was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not br br it would do good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to americans of all stripes the fact is that black people among others did not as a rule not an exception receive the benefits of the justice system as even handedly as whites segregation discrimination and lynching are historical fact people like might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior it would be a wonderful thing if southern ancestors if any never participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and i hope they didn't if that is so congratulations to them but that fact if true does not erase the fact that others did and even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the south and other areas let's not forget the draft riots of the civil war era were only half as numerous only a third does that make them any less horrible is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred br br asks us to get the mississippi burning chip off of our shoulders before we see intruder in the dust well i ask you did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not why should that be forgotten forgiven maybe but in order to prevent their they cannot be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences the racism that is displayed in intruder in the dust is displayed there quite purposely it is there to make a point br br on a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for to discount the racial angle any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960's knows that black actors characters extras were usually deliberately cast to judge from our movie history wars were always fought by middle aged white men there were no black people in the old west it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person there were no black hospital taxi drivers clerks etc blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor if and brown had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the hernandez character black br br racism exists probably for different reasons i am sure we both wish that it didn't but it does wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can't be helped but it still does not make them so
<START> this is apparently the first film featuring gloria swanson the film that made her a breakout star while she was good in the film i can't see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the time but still it was a very good film br br gloria plays the wife of a rich slob that continually takes her for granted he cares little for his grooming eats onions and forgets their anniversary and at the same time a lothario comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to gloria and her dippy husband doesn't even notice or give her any reason not to cheat on him ultimately she divorces her hubby and marries the smooth talking romeo however while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama they were pretty common at the time it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film while not the greatest silent film i have seen it is a standout and deserves to be remembered br br by the way the dvd release from image entertainment is surprisingly good with a decent print and music this hasn't always been true of other image releases particularly how sloppily they handled the chaplin releases
<START> the diary of anne frank is the second best selling nonfiction book in the world and for good reason nonetheless sitting through this documentary about her life which fills in some of the details where the diary left off i thought just another documentary about anne frank i found it to be competent but not extraordinary that was my complacent attitude because i was already well aware of the story of anne frank most of what the documentary had to tell me wasn't news to me br br everything changed though when i got to the end of the documentary when i saw the motion picture footage of anne frank the emotional impact of seeing this footage only a second or so long made everything that came before it a thousand times more real but not just everything that was in the documentary everything i had previously known about anne frank suddenly became more real to me more personal i'd always been moved by her story but when i saw that footage what i felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life i knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of anne frank and i'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience it's not likely that my mentioning it here will spoil it for anyone br br i realize now that many people still don't know the story of anne frank it's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance i think to myself how could someone not know the story of anne frank this being the case though anne frank remembered along with reading her diary is the best place to start it's a story that everyone should know
<START> one crazy summer is a fun and quirky look at love through the eyes of hoops mccann what could have been hokey and dull is one of the freshest and most energetic comedies ever savage steve holland with john cusack to make the ultimate summer movie
