<START> this is a very funny movie there is a self deprecating iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing the characters are interesting the movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour 50 minutes duration of the film the film quality is not of the highest hollywood standards however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punk rock style the documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow the original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie the interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix like rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film in my mind the documentary a texas tale of treason is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film vacation would have ever been two thumbs up for a job well done
<START> night of the hunted stars french porn star brigitte in fact many of the cast members in this slow moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming this film is certainly different than rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks but it's not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascination plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex where is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition anyway she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held on a highway outside of town she meets a young man who stops and picks her up night of the hunted offers plenty of nudity unfortunately the pace is extremely slow the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte and another asylum inmate dominique is well developed still night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyable give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin's works 7 out of 10 and that's being kind
<START> this film is a mediocre low budget flick i've seen much worse on mst3k let me assure you but this is still a pretty crappy film br br the film is about a top secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians it's an almost orwellian society actually almost but not quite effective br br the film starts to roll downhill when the head clone tim connely of fame falls in love with a female clone breen who appeared in this and at most four other films and this was not her first film they begin to suspect something after finding a beer can in the nearby river the plot starts to unravel the clone receives no answers from either the head scientist dick sargent from or the a computer which supposedly knows everything so he breaks into the main building and in a scene hilariously destroyed by mike and the bots finds out the truth including a clone video which eerily shows the exact same method that was used to clone dolly five years ago and this film was made over twenty years ago about he breaks free pursued by two guards he has one hell of a time breaking through the two foot high fences though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some boulders from there it continues to slide also appearing are peter graves beginning of the end' it conquered the world' as the presidential candidate and keenan wynn dr once upon a time in the west' and tuttle ma barker's killer psycho' as the elderly couple who help after he escapes br br the mst3k version was priceless one of the best episodes ever br br four stars for the film 10 for the mst3k version
<START> i had expected a fairly straightforward r rated graphic sexual crude teen comedy when i sat down to see this it turned out to be fairly accurate only it was far more sick and disgusting than i would have thought i don't know if the director writer gregory is sick or deeply messed up sexually but i doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this i could probably have taken it if it was just that if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach but it isn't the film is also horribly mean spirited and disturbing every single character that has more than one full second of time on screen is an extreme sexually mentally or physically i don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor but i just found it to be wrong just wrong even in a comedy there is supposed to be some seriousness the plot is stupid the acting is bad the characters are inconsistent and poorly written all of them there isn't one single likable character in the film the humor is disgusting and goes way too far the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really don't think it's worth anyone's time if you like r rated crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff watch the groomsmen or better yet american pie or road trip my personal favorite but don't watch this i can't possibly describe to you how bad it is you would have to experience it for yourself however this is one of those times where i'll say that you're better off wondering that way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom without knowing that it goes through it and far lower than that this movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together put together a film crew and every time one of them got an idea they filmed it and later put the entire thing together it lacks structure consistency and taste i recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other r rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality everyone else do the sensible thing avoid this it's not even worth it to see the booty believe me 1 10
<START> written produced and directed by charlie chaplin this is the great actor's anti nazi propaganda piece skewering adolf hitler br br chaplin plays the dictator of as well as a jewish barber who is spitting image his parody of hitler is brilliant anyone who has ever seen newsreels of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature br br i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slap stick focussing on the first world war adventures of the jewish barber having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about but the movie picks up steam quickly there are some very funny moments and enough emphasis on the anti jewish nature of ism to make the propaganda point the climax of the film is a brilliant anti nazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the movie br br as good as chaplin is in this movie though i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack oakie playing the dictator of bacteria our first look at oakie shows how well he had studied his subject he had mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat the scenes in which and negotiate over the fate of had me in stitches br br this was a very good movie and well worth watching
<START> i would like to make it very clear that i am not at all religious i am an atheist but i could see that richard was contradicting himself over and over again i would also like to make it known that i am not the sort of person that argues against something with philosophy all the time but i feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question the belief in main stream science as well as questioning religious beliefs br br i wonder if richard ever spends any time to think philosophically about belief anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realise that science is indeed a religion in itself yes there is a fundamental difference between the way that scientific beliefs are held when compared with other religions but at it's roots it's faith in a particular human instinct br br throughout this series richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence for it is strong enough if you dig deep enough into how science functions you'll realise that it is just as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end faith in the evidence faith in our sanity faith in our senses but more than anything else faith in our instinct to follow patterns of br br this is not easy to explain but think about how the laws of physics were decided it was because they were and still are the most common patterns of that we are aware of i think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or place of existence the more we just assume out of blind faith that it is more likely to stay like it for example we don't expect that gravity will suddenly work in reverse tomorrow by this i mean pushing matter away as supposed to attracting it but the only reason why we don't expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware however that doesn't mean that it couldn't do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even right now it doesn't matter how long something may stay in a certain state or change there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it but we do out of instinct i would ask you to consider what is a long and short amount of time there is no such thing i don't know exactly how long it took for these supposed wise men to decide that everything must be made out of matter sound light etc but lets give them what they would consider to be an edge way lets say far longer than it really was 12 years is that a long period of time years makes 12 years seem like an incredibly short period of time for all we know there could be an extreme amount of change in the so called laws of science within the next trillion years it's all about comparison only when we compare things can we say that is long or that is short it's the same with big and small wide and thin heavy and light strong and weak and others br br i doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense i certainly don't see why it should but that doesn't mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it with this in mind the most hypocritical comment that richard made was when he said that faith is irrational a process of non thinking he said if what we have in this instinct that i've been describing and this instinct that we all possess on some level isn't faith then i don't know what the hell it is other times when he is being hypocritical is when he talks about the religions being bronze age bronze age myths he says i would like to point out that no matter how much scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience experiments and evaluating the pure rules of science are getting older and older all the time they could even be described as the holy bible of science he was going on about how he is sick of the different religions being stubborn i am right he is wrong but looking back on how rude he was to the various interviewees he seems to be just as stubborn him self to be fair to him at least he doesn't try to bomb religious communities i appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war but i don't respect his arrogance in his own beliefs br br as far as i'm concerned richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way i am scientifically minded as well but i don't think he has the right to go up to religious leaders having unfriendly arguments trying to force his opinion on to them and virtually describing them as stupid despite all his education experience and discoveries he seems to fail to have the wisdom to properly question his very own system of belief i have read what he says in defence of this argument that open minded atheists such as my self put forward what he states suggests to me that he is totally missing the point br br finally the title of the documentary root of all evil this states that religion is the root of all evil it isn't true there are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion br br all round the documentary series was frustrating narrow minded hypocritical and flat out rubbish
<START> done on a spare change budget of twenty bucks tops this cheapie thirteen minute short cheerfully parodies george lucas' legendary '77 sci fi blockbuster star wars in the most infectiously dumb way imaginable writer director ernie delivers a winning and often gut busting blend of ludicrous sound effects ineptly staged action scenes cruddy far from special effects you just gotta love the cheesy scratched on film lasers asteroids and household appliances i mean spaceships being swung around on obvious wires badly dubbed in dialogue shamelessly hammy acting and richard wagner's rousing piece of classical music ride of the valkyries the characters are presented in suitably broad strokes my favorites are whiny wimp fluke venerable jedi knight auggie ben doggie and hateful arch villain nader who spouts nothing but incomprehensible gibberish moreover 4 q 3 is clearly based on the tin man from the wizard of oz while artie deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner this film's true masterstroke is casting legendary voice actor supreme paul frees as the narrator deliciously rich and plummy histrionic tones add immensely to the considerable silly yet sidesplitting tongue in cheek merriment choice lines you'll laugh you'll cry you'll kiss three bucks goodbye a total hoot
<START> when i went to see this i thought i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also wrong there was no suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs when i was done watching this i had lost all respect for steven spielberg and michael crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by spielberg or written by michael crichton this movie was going through the motions i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it
<START> in this 4th child's play film chucky gets lucky it's very funny and there are some enjoyable parts very good direction not as bad as it could be the best one in the series since the first three stars out of four
<START> flash gordon was a first rate serial i know there were a few goofs however i didn't watch it for the flaws buster crabbe is flash gordon he was not a trained actor but he gave a very good convincing performance jean rogers is pretty and at 20 yrs old did in my opinion a pretty good job charles middleton as emperor ming is superb he was in a lot of other movies quite versatile he could sing and dance his portrayal of ming the merciless in all 3 flash gordon serials was top notch the rest of the cast also did a very good job well boys and girls get some popcorn settle back and enjoy john r tracy
<START> at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn't so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don't waste your time or money
<START> only saw this movie late last night i remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn't have been so generous i hate hype it can ruin a movie i think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody he was good too although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time it never went too deep redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end to me he should have been more confrontational with demi throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for after all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal that's not shown in the movie but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet demi fell for him the passages giving an insight to demi and woody's relationship were the best part of the movie there was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of john character he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded i think the movies draw card was redford and they didn't want tarnish his image i say what the hell robert was old in this movie woody and characters were naive in a sense but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision but the reality is they were losing their dream home and where did they go las vegas to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire i found their naivety when redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference but having said that on late night tv it was enjoyable and i if you don't think too much also palatable
<START> goldie hawn's depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man a dentist played with such relish by walter matthau that she won the best supporting actress oscar for 1969 br br the film however is another tribute to ingrid bergman rarely did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for matthau to tell hawn that they're married br br it is such a joy to watch matthau and bergman fall for each other here theirs is an accidental love affair in the making br br as matthau's friend jack weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well rick lenz gives ample support as hawn's newly found boyfriend as well
<START> i was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie first many have said that they have taken their 4 year old daughters and granddaughters to see this and they did not enjoy it first i don't believe that this is a kid's movie at least not a movie for very very young children not 4 at least it has very subtle humor but it is not meant to offer quick amusement as seen in tom and jerry or something like this many people have also complained that it goes very very slowly i guess those people are all used to quantity over quality while i have a small quality problem myself with this movie and that is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies i still believe that it managed quite well for a full feature film and how can people complain about the jokes the jokes were sensible timely and well thought out never rude insulting or in your face wallace is extremely smart yet cautious and is the most adorable smart and cute character that could be this was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate for adults that is especially with the increase of obesity and disease in the world there's nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for once and this was accomplished in a very tasteful manner in that while people are concerned with the aspect of vegetables that doesn't necessarily mean that the are healthier or that they eat more of them but just that they temper with nature which is in fact what caused the legend of the were rabbit to come true and for those out there that complained about the religious jokes i say came on are you for real many villages revolve around the local church and legends premonitions etc are normal themes no harm done this movie was absolutely amazing yet some people had negative comments on it and i find this absolutely absurd
<START> anyone who rates this movie above a 3 has a very distorted view of movies anyone who rated this piece of sh t 7 or higher i have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies and doubt they have ever seen a good one i am always up for giving any movie a shot and i did with this one i tried to pay attention i tried not to let my money go 2 waste but 15 minutes in my friends were laughing at me cause i was 2 my ipod 25 minutes later i couldn't even watch the overacting that was occurring within the film so i up and left i have never ever ever walked out of a movie until this garbage anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar or they should be banned from this site i get so angry when i see a person rate this an 8 when the godfathers overall rating is a 9 1 its like saying that that movie was close which it isn't
