<START> contains spoilers br br the british director j lee thompson made some excellent films notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear' but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson an eccentric aristocratic landowner his sister hilary and hilary's estranged husband douglas who is hoping for a reconciliation with her we learn that during his career as an army officer charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre' this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle the film ends with his committal to an upper class lunatic asylum br br peter o'toole was when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia' one of britain's leading actors but the quality of his work was very uneven and 'country dance' is not one of his better films he overacts frantically making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper class twit of the year' sketch susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film there is also little in the way of coherent plot beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide br br the main problem with the film however is neither the acting nor the plot but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name there are half hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy unfortunately even in the swinging sixties and early seventies the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970 there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off limits the american title for the film was 'brotherly love' but this was not used in britain was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre 4 10
<START> maybe i'm biased because the f 16 is my favorite fighter aircraft although the f 14 is probably second or third but i liked this movie the sequels iron eagle ii and iii don't measure up acting and plot wise but the first one along with top gun have excellent flying and music along with reasonable plots and acting ii and iii clearly have much less of a flight budget but their main drawback is plot and acting i suspect the relative fame and popularity of iron eagle compared to top gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of jason compared to tom cruise another plus for me is an all too brief appearance by smith 7 10
<START> if anyone ever assembles a compendium on modern american horror that is truly worth it's salt there will have to be an entry for sf in asylum horror every time i watch this movie i am impressed by the complete economy of the film from the compact totally self contained plot with a puzzling beginning and an all too horrible ending the engaging performances by what was essentially a group of non professional actors and a sense of dread and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the with a certain inevitability which is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is going on long before the hero es with the only question being when are they going to wake up smell the coffee br br shot on a dental floss budget in native texas at an old palatial manor that nicely serves as the setting for a private sanitorium don't look in the basement is another intriguing twist on the good old edgar allan poe tome about inmates taking over the asylum just before an otherwise normal outsider unwittingly joins the ranks without realizing until it is far too late that not all is what it seems they are totally cut off beyond any outside help and inevitably find their own sanity questioned as the madness spins out of control the original star trek tv series had a go at this with their whom gods destroy episode from 1968 juan gave the proceedings a peyote fueled mexican psychedelic trip in dr tarr's torture dungeon in 1972 and tangentially related is fernando di leo's asylum erotica slaughter hotel which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as splatter cinema may not have seen or been thinking of slaughter hotel but he sure came up with some similar ideas br br former playboy playmate rosie plays charlotte beale rn in clinical psychology who has just left her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital to travel way out into the middle of some god forsaken waste right out of a peckinpah movie to work with a dr stevens at his private sanitorium dr stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based upon basically encouraging the emotionally psychologically scarred to face their inner obsessions bring them to the surface and hopefully rid the patients of whatever has fried their sense of reasoning nice idea but arming a 6ft 250 pound utterly insane man with an axe and telling him to pound out his aggression and then turning your back on him probably isn't the smartest idea and dr stevens is dispatched before ms even appears onscreen with a good whack to the lower portion of his skull br br this event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of one geraldine masters actress annabelle who also served as the script supervisor production manager a woman of startlingly professional demeanor who quickly defuses the situation with the help of sam the film's wonderfully unlikely hero a lobotomized african american played by an actor named bill who was sadly robbed of a supporting oscar nomination for his turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy sam's one wish is to have someone help him put his prized toy boat in the water and his continual asking of the various female cast members to do so and his nonstop consumption of chocolate popsicles as some kind of underlying theme though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up there is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients but i'll leave the details of that to your discovery br br ms arrives just as dr stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy professionalism of ms masters who reluctantly allows the leggy young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened oh twenty minutes ago which you must admit was rather sporting of her nurse beale begins to demonstrate symptoms of not being the sharpest meat cleaver in the drawer however when informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors doesn't trudge off for the nearest ace hardware store to pick up a and to secure herself and we are treated to a couple of truly creepy scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room do stuff like smell her hair try to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with axe heads but that's all a part of working in such a radical psychiatric health care environment ms master's informs her and she goes about her oddly defined rounds that consist of wearing as leg defining a nurse outfit as you can find in a 42nd street fetish boutique and getting to know the inmates br br is a obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal who likes to take off her shirt provide the film with some t a between fits of histrionics harriet is a young former mother who let her child die in a stupid accident and now dotes on a beat up old doll that she is also homicidally protective of the is an actual and implied vietnam vet who's negligence led to the death of his platoon and now watches from the window with binoculars for the approach of an unseen enemy jennifer is a fan who couldn't score a ticket to the new year's eve show and went insane likes to scarf down and other when nobody is looking and likewise has hidden homicidal linked to her inability to find a bra judge cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who became obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with axes ms is an aged poet who serves as a sort of old hag from macbeth before the cat gets her tongue and danny is an insane idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control and who's antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies murders that ultimately take place in this dark old creepy house in the middle of nowhere br br the house itself is a wonderful set with a threadbare early 1970's decor that is remarkable in it's with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting the house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors twisting confined secreted closets and passageways leading to the different larger areas and of course the basement mentioned in the title visited only once but boy it sure proves to be a doozy i love the old freezer where sam keeps his stash of popsicles the utterly plain exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year force us to in the heat everyone is covered with beads of and looks exhausted and even the ever cheerful sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening though he cannot understand what it all means and rosie h is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened and while ms limitations of an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her big revelation scene she's a great screamer when all hell starts to break loose and indulged of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of undress that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract too bad br br the real show stealer is sam however and fans of what i have been taught to refer to as splatter cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale and there is something moving about how sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone within arms reach in a matter of seconds that either suggests he was one mean before his lobotomy or the film is cut in any event you won't be prepared for the ending the first time you see it even though you as the viewer know what the score is long before anyone else in the film has put it all together br br except for one person rhea uproariously stereotyped old coot mrs who seems to be inspired by the donald sutherland old woman character from the michael reeves' 1964 christopher lee film castle of the living dead in addition to a rather nasty death by round spike to the eye who not only predicts the future but has the film's most laugh out loud amusing bit of dialogue while on a walk in the garden with ms that runs something like this br br it's really beautiful out here do you get out much mrs asks to which the old woman replies br br it's you who needs to get out br br hilarious and one of those things you gotta kind of see for yourself to get don't look in the basement is available on at least a half dozen bargain bin dvd releases by companies like brentwood home video diamond entertainment and platinum disc corp 's horror classics series i kind of like alpha video's sexily gorgeously decorated 6 release from 2003 br br dig through those bargain bins but make sure you get one with the 89 90 minute print contained therein an older 83 minute version is downright confusing due to some of the and you really need to see the ending credits as intended to bring this sick twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to it's end br br masterpiece maybe not compared to the exorcist or rosemary's baby but it is a very uniquely american horror film and a genuine classic of the drive in age that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something made with more than just a little bit of brain juice and not a penny more than they absolutely needed br br 1 2 out of
<START> this is absolutely the worst comedy i have ever seen it's hard to explain though because unless you've seen this i bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad it's just there that's the original part not good or bad just there br br let me say that i have seen every comedian appearing in a main role and like them all that's what makes this such a mystery the supporting leads are actually acting although the dialog is bad the only character that is fairly good is the one played by john goodman he does a pretty good job with what little dialog he has and actually has one funny line i won't spoil the only funny line in the movie in case you decide to watch anyway it involves a pancake the big mysteries are the main leads i won't call them characters because no characters have been developed this script is so juvenile that they don't even bother to give the leads fictional names they all just use their own they don't even seem to be trying to act it's as though they are all reading out loud to each other from scripts that the local junior high sent to them i actually wrote a paper like this for my english class when i was thirteen it wasn't funny either br br bottom line just don't bother to rent this it isn't funny it doesn't even have the kind of bad dialog you can groan to i just sat there and stared through the whole thing it was so boring i couldn't even work up any irritation at how bad it was i can't imagine how this is even getting a rating of 4 here
<START> why all the negative reviews you didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me not an oscar contender just entertainment you can really see how the movie has aged especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you but who's to say it can't happen i'm not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death analyzing it until i'm blue in the face that's not my style average acting and once again very entertaining sandra bullock as angela bennett is so cute this is my favorite movie with her in it because she's like the computer genius which i find very attractive of all the movies that were released in 1995 this would have to be my favorite although i didn't see it until 1996 my rating 9 10 because it did slow down a little
<START> so you wanna be a rock star see this movie you don't like rock you say or you're really into heavy metal then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away this movie has nothing to offer rarely have i ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this i had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties and i have played guitar for the last 15 years or so did i like rock star oh yes the music is good not great the actors are good and believable even jennifer aniston plays her part to perfection and mark wahlberg is perfect as the wannabe rock singer so you know what you're going to get a movie about dreams coming true being stepped on and finally figuring out what life is really about it's a good solid seven out of ten no more no less
<START> when oh when will someone like anchor bay or blue underground release this on widescreen dvd le which i only know because of my rare vintage video collecting habit is a film in my collection that i would not only sit through but actually enjoy watching the fact that klaus kinski is top billed but is only in small parts of the film means little to me though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time i cannot say that this is a good horror film a good mystery a sci fi epic or anything of that nature it is simply unclassifiable in the genre sense of things it is more like a confusing frightening though not particularly violent or bloody dream filled with great visuals and mystery it relies on visuals and emotion much like bava's lisa and the devil both films are beautiful in almost every sense but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner they both occur in such a dream like atmosphere don't be deterred by force video's synopsis on the back cover it is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that though force video's release from 1986 the only one in the us that i know of is cropped to full screen on tape even in that format it is still great releasing it remastered and or letterboxed would make it magnificent hint hint dvd companies
<START> like many others i had been attracted to the combination of pollack ford and scott thomas i had enjoyed the work of pollack and ford on sabrina a well made film and a careful rewrite of the old material on hearing that this film was in production i ordered and read the book immediately it seemed that this would be a more difficult story to film the characters are not always sympathetic there is little if any humor and the author makes numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his principal theme that since each would see the other as the only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought on by the air crash the completely surprised spouses would seek each other out moreover he imagines that resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives and that this experience of thick and thin could yield a deeper love than each had previously although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their building hatred of their former partners in the end acceptance and forgiveness are found the film script retains only the air crash and the shared predicament of the spouses where the woman is the research aggressor in the book it is the man in the film and the woman is never a willing co researcher the film has a completely new dramatic sub plot for harrison ford which seems even more contrived than the double coincidence of the air crash the congresswoman up for re election sub plot for the woman is also new yet it works better audience the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy cannot be met because this story on a very bitter pill where resolution and forgiveness is achieved in the book however lifting the burden of bitterness from the reader and permitting levity there is no corresponding moment in the film although forgiveness is never hinted at we are left to surmise that healing following a shooting does double duty ford's character need not be such an unentertaining man of few words and scott thomas's accent change is a little disconcerting at first this film is not the dead loss suggested by others it is however a difficult film to appreciate because the rewrite and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously achieved by the director cast
<START> this is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern california that was directed by james bridges and stars jane fonda jack lemmon and michael douglas fonda plays a tv reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist but is only allowed to be a tv reporter douglas is an independent cameraman and lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear plant fonda and douglas are sent on a routine assignment at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film everyone tries to cover it up except fonda and douglas so douglas steals the film lemmon starts to investigate and finds out the company cares more about profit then safety at the plant it's a good movie with a pretty good ending
<START> warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham handed with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we're americans we don't run from trouble we face up to our responsibilities it also suggests that if you're willing to yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters you're un american walter huston looking bored is the frustrated da and the average american family includes such familiar faces as sally blane looking a lot like her sister loretta young and dickie moore as an allegedly adorable moppet both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran ponderously jumping and amusingly at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're americans his st dance old coot performance is tiresome schtick it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it william wellman directs efficiently and quickly much like his earlier public enemy but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout i e they'd probably be rubbed out by the mob
<START> it's hard to comment on this movie it's one of the few movies dimension actually has not shelved it's hard to come up with a reason why and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters it's opening day maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece br br ray sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident and in return he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns at the morgue ray comes back to life and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur br br what brings this movie down is it's paper thin characters i didn't care for one moment about any of them also the dialog was less than ho hum also it was very predictable characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things like check creaky noises call out people's names and trip on a rock while being chased i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shown br br what's good well there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks on br br but other than that it's another august september disappointment i was looking forward to it but i did not get what was expected
<START> don wilson stars as jack cutter ooh real tough name a vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks how convenient as it cuts down on the budget and it's here cutter runs into a reporter melanie smith of trancers iii fame night hunter's action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although it's meant to emphasize the mood it just makes the movie more jarring what is worse is that these fight sequences are botched beyond belief as wilson's martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this predates blade however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had don wilson in it it's from roger corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay not to see i unfortunately am a bottom feeder and i cater to the section of the store looking for gems in this line of work you always run into turds with night hunter i just may have the world's turd br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenter's in the mouth of madness not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences on the other hand this movie mixes very well the image and the music note the 4th chapter in the movie
<START> here is another great film critics will love the problem is that it is not a very good movie br br the films premise is simple nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is br br the first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy br br the two halves simply don't mix individual scenes do work very well the guys crashing a friends house who has a new filipino bride is hilarious while a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings they simply don't mesh with each other br br the movie as well is missing entire set ups one scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack the very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant where did they get the dresses and wigs the crew includes both the big guy and a midget how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal and most puzzling is why are they in drag they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other in fact they wear matching white throughout most of the movie the movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch as we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes br br speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film it is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie br br 9 souls is a big disappointment the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere good luck finding it yourself
<START> this movie has lots of action and little heart let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the russian revolution wrong after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story in fact the czar after world war i proved a disaster for the country and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo democracy until the leninists took power nine months later mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw russia from the war now back to our story br br here we have the revolution being rumored in russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman baron nikita douglas fairbanks jr he flees his home with his former servant girl nancy carroll in tow and they start to make a new life in before the revolution the baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl not out of any real passion but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts the revolution doesn't change this and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl it certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so follows the baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the baron's home and she has known no other life other than waiting on nikki hand and foot once in nikki quickly of life as a penniless laborer and that is when he meets up with his former lover russian aristocrat vera who has a plan for getting them to paris where the have after the revolution unfortunately for vera's plan does not include her br br this film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress nancy carroll she does a good job with what little she is given to do but that is not much is the standout here even though she has only a small role as russian vamp vera was so often given supporting roles just as she is here but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears guy kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an american tourist who is curious about the russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland
