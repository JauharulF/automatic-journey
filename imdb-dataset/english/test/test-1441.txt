<START> well okay maybe not perfect but it was pretty close this movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end but they did it smoothly and some in the theater found the bloody parts like the scene to be funny as well i just about threw up but i guess that's just me greg kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor he has the ability to perform those over dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations his scenes with betty seem like something out of sleepless in seattle or some other romantic comedy like that you almost forget that morgan freeman and chris rock are searching betty down morgan freeman's fascination with betty was rather creepy considering that he could practically be her grandfather but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs chris rock's performance seems rather wooden but he has his moments renee zellweger is so sweet as betty the lovable waitress with the crude unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt it's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials but hey it's a movie just go along with it her roommate rosa shines as well as a woman who cares about betty but doesn't quite know how to deal with betty's sickness and lastly there is crispin glover as a fan of his i naturally thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more no one else has the same style of acting that crispin has and the argument between chris rock crispin and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious i guess i'm saying that i liked this movie quite a bit if you can stomach blood violence and a lot of foul language it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs
<START> the best movie of the 90's the welsh trainspotting aye right i went into this movie with pretty high expectations and it was all downhill from there br br this movie was supposed to be this archetypal movie on the drug culture of the early 90's and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene and shatter the media's preconceptions following the moral panic which followed the death of leah betts in 1995 unfortunately it has fallen a long way short br br where trainspotting was able to treat you like an adult on the subject and potential problems that surround drugs this just provided us with some schmaltzy tale of the wonder of drugs and how it can like you know like totally open your mind cue some guff about bill hicks and howard marks ad nausea it is painfully bad at times i mean the scene at the end between lulu and her auntie actually made me laugh out loud br br now maybe i am just a cynic but the way jip leads us through this tale is like listening to that acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party who talks to you about how the man is holding us back and how acid has released him from the strains of modern society you just wanna shake some sense into him and ask him to leave the premises br br the script was a real problem for me because where trainspotting had irvine excellent book to cite from this is written and directed by justin kerrigan the words jack of all trades master of none come to mind you can see where his inspiration comes from particularly in the style of narration from main character jip which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and outlines what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out the problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for jip but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average a level drama project the direction is fine and the intentions are good but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about br br saying that though it is not all bad there are moments which are genuinely very amusing and entertaining is the highlight of the movie for me for an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality british actors actresses which maybe outlines why there was such a buzz about the movie br br best movie of the 90's not by a long shot but if you're looking for a solid sunday night movie then this might just be your bag inevitably though the movie is flawed by the hype that surrounds it
<START> i love watching a good gory giallo unfortunately solange is definitely not one of them it's long very long the story is tacky and makes very little sense even if it's very obvious the script spends so much time on the killings and the girls but it spends almost no time at all on the killer this leaves a big hole in the story we might get to see a bunch of young women showering together but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls yes what happened to solange is terrible but we still pretty much left in the dark over when why did the boring killer decided that it was worth going through the effort of offing those oh so naughty girls it's all so contrived that i couldn't get into it one bit br br as for the look of the film again boring nothing memorable about it the actors boring the script laughably boring the whole torrid love affair between the teacher the blond and the student was really embarrassing what planet are they living on the music boring skip it
<START> at a saturday matinee in my home town i went with an older friend he was about 12 and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok it's rated g i was assaulted by loud music strange images no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense we left halfway through because we were bored frustrated and our ears hurt br br i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre my opinion had changed it's even worse basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60s and has dated badly i got all the little in jokes too bad they weren't funny the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on some people will love this i found it frustrating by the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen br br also all the monkees songs in this movie suck and i do like them br br for ex hippies only or if you're stoned i give this a 1
<START> divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life pet project for actress co producer kate capshaw who gives a warm nicely modulated lead performance yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in initially capshaw's helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her an interesting visual joke but the first person they do this ploy with is ellen degeneres who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick and the continuity is extremely choppy supporting cast including tom selleck and tom everett scott who mostly acts with his shirt off is very good but they can't save the final act which is disappointing low keyed in a quirky pleasant way but it is blandly good natured nothing more 1 2 from
<START> you can't really call roy prolific 6 films in 37 years nor can you accuse him of being conventional he doesn't do 'straight at least when it comes to narrative you the living his first film in seven years is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds off putting let me assure you it isn't this is a funny accessible and surprisingly warm hearted movie a slice of life far removed from that which we normally see on the screen br br of course of life' is hardly the proper moniker to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be anything like this the incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost terrifyingly ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may flit by sometimes never to be seen again others to reappear as if anxious for approval on them all a kind of benign affection that and some rollicking music ensure the time we spend with them is time well spent
<START> just watched this film and it actually made me want to write my first comment on imdb com even though i've been a user for more than 9 years the reason that i watched this is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still shocks me first of all the gore in this film didn't shock me not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film what really shocked me is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap don't get me wrong i'm all against censorship but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to get off on this type of sh t it didn't give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like august underground that film is terrible to watch but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is in the case of it seems like it was made strictly to arouse people i prefer films that shock because they are well done and thought through like gaspar noe's films or takashi miike's or funny games or man bites dog those films will stick with you for a while this film i will have forgotten by tomorrow and the only thing that will stick with me is the thought that somewhere out there there are people getting aroused by watching this sh t if you read this please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself this of course does not apply to gore hounds who just love splatter you're cool peace
<START> when i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny the picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers such as road trip which i thought would be worth watching when i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy the only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a wet floor this is not a joke and would not make people laugh i actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through i was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it i found the acting to be quite bad as well the only time i laughed was at the extremely bad actions done which were really not funny i rate this film a 1 10 i hope you found this comment useful
<START> in yet another miserable attempt to make a quick hollywood cash in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces peter segal has created a monster taken out of context if one did not know brooks' work before viewing the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on however as a young generation who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of get smart the 60's tv show this movie pained me from the moment i entered and saw steve carell dumbing down the part the backstories agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring of them it seems the screenwriters unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation fell back on lame set ups for don adams famous lines flashbacks to fat camp references to carell's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face br br for those who have seen the original the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories they mention herbie fang now a worthless tiny furry dog that carell covets the shoe phone the cone of silence and his classic red car and the doors and phone that the show the classic music is back but now everything is updated generally for the worse cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves past the movie lacks any creative random tech and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives lots of the humor in the movie is carrel hurting himself or another character being hurt whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow or getting punched by security guards or throwing up in airplanes in the original smart would insult a big foe attack him with no success and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized in this one he attacks without success and gets pummeled it seems the screenwriters didn't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence it's like they took the names from the show and cut out all that made it good in the first place br br the poster hides carell's face beyond that of the movie likewise shies away from anything that could make it good they intertwine the classic music with the over dramatic action and romantic music in big budget films whereas the original fed off a campy feel this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects i was really looking forward to this as i finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time however this was a massive disappointment the credits say they collaborated with mel brooks and buck henry but in all the things i've read on the internet they were largely left out of the writing process in conclusion if you want to waste your money on a cash in with little value and no respect to its namesake go for it but be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it br br ps i almost forgot the george bush humor they mention falling asleep at fine art president's working for their vice pres and appreciating tackles over solving real problems if you're into hearing the same jokes you heard 3 4 years ago in big budget movie form chuck your money here
<START> don't get me wrong the guy's a success dynamo but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market br br see the invincible iron man wouldn't be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward children but it's not directed exclusively at children periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi nude bodies to make network censors squirm so it isn't quite cut out for children's television br br so what audience is this video aiming for then it's the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings that's who and i think that audience is small br br a lot of great writers have passed through marvel's over the decades so it's a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who like mr are better accustomed to action figures during saturday morning cartoons how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy br br br br animation just passable cels some segments are better than others a low budget look all throughout this ain't no bakshi ralph and it ain't no bluth don cg animation's okay but far from impressive br br story a litany of clichÃ©s all over the place convoluted contrived and uninspired br br characters so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to sexual ambiguity hmmm her dad's in a wheelchair tony misses his mom asian chicks are hot and apparently little else the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the end br br performances can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script br br art very western musculature very clean lines faces are very derivative of eastern art very boring mattes very bland cg br br conclusion not great but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths a 'must buy' for collectors a valuable what not to do course for junior animators
<START> astounding that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public i knew it was by uwe boll i found it in the bargain bin at a store for 2 still pretty steep considering but morbid curiosity led me to view this and br br 1 i am fairly sure this is a rip off of seven silence of the lambs and american psycho all rolled into one with dialog that may have been written by preteens br br 2 casper van dien plays the main character and he's so absolutely bizarre and creepy that just about anyone would know he must be the crazed serial killer br br 3 jennifer rubin plays the good cop that invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home cooked dinner and what does she get for her trouble i'll let you guess br br 4 michael pare plays an intense cop who drives a vw bug new style that is with a siren on it a vw bug that'll strike fear into criminal's hearts when they see that coming br br 5 van dien breaks up with his fiancÃ© but she still has an not engaged party complete with not a wedding cake imagine everyone's surprise he shows up he was of course invited and they all get shot br br 6 actually this should have been 1 really the killer in this is known as the monkey maker this is without a doubt the stupidest killer name anyone could have come up with in a million years presumably it has something to do with the see no evil hear no evil speak no evil saying complete with monkeys it's possible that monkeys had something to do with the script too br br 7 oh yeah and there's a club that van dien visits near the beginning of the film there's bad disco music i mean really bad and a chain link fenced cage with uh gang members beating the crap out of each other with baseball bats that's what it looked like and of course this is only the tip of the iceberg the really cool stuff goes on in the basement where some questionable actor talks some woman into signing a confession before she gets shot this being i guess a snuff movie not quite sure how this fits in with the rest of the film and boll probably wasn't either so if he wasn't worried then i won't worry br br an incredible piece of non entertainment that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe a parallel universe that's kind of like ours but where things are just enough off where they don't seem right you have entered the boll zone exit as quickly as possible don't look back br br 2 out of 10
<START> an art student in rome is possessed or something she has dreams of being nailed to a cross and satan himself raping her he possesses her i think and turns her into a sex addict that's about all i could take and i turned it off br br a pointless exorcist rip off i caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified and not in a good way this movie is supposed to be a horror film but turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror movie there's tons of pointless female nudity and the actress playing the lead has to degrade herself more than once we see her being raped by satan a hot looking guy masturbating coming on to her own father gotta give her points for bravery add to that bad dubbing editing the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit lousy acting and a story that makes next to no sense the one disturbing sequence her being nailed to the cross almost works but the lousy special effects ruin it this is one of the few horror film that was so bad i stopped watching skip it
<START> corny and some really bad acting but for a golan globus film about right on par saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery films what was i thinking arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world brigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was sly's girl and a pretty bad actress movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord there is also bergman who was in the original conan movie as valeria here she plays the evil queen an obvious camp to her conan role and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen ernie reyes as prince who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed what a little irritating some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks special effects are cheap and look very 70's like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie br br overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness
<START> a few yrs ago i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell this theorist wrote that the of the women' that r played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man even when he wasn't worth it br br i thought of this essay after watching 'crimes of br br kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue she's the object of affection for two men the loony priest played by anthony perkins and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading and she won't let either of them have a piece of her until br br i won't give away the ending but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boy's fantasy no matter how hard ken russell tries he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation except its class and gender politics make those old black and white films look revolutionary by comparison
<START> i can't even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much it had me literally crying with laughter several times i trust you slept well actually we had a bit of a rough night ah the perils of adultery br br admittedly the ending is a little flat but still has its moments the booger ball's obvious fake as flew into the ocean beach house paradiso br br personally i think this is the funniest movie i've ever seen br br 10 10
