<START> i am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 or even more than a 2 it is full of bad lines bad acting bad slapstick etc i never thought i could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of uhf but this was it and just when you think it can't possibly get any worse it does over and over again you actually could have watched this in a theater it wasn't worth free on tv my 4 year old and 1 year old liked it some but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on
<START> this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims' parents without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents and the christian vision of all the questions implied we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesn't lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed legal way
<START> this final installment of the airport franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy like airplane george kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat seeking missiles was comical what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed you'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm the passengers were unintentionally hilarious as was the interior of the plane the sophisticated french woman coming on to slobby george kennedy was like jackie kennedy coming on to ernest borgnine ain't gonna happen susan blakely a talented and unappreciated actress did not get any points on her resume for this one neither did robert wagner this movie was so lousy it seemed surreal
<START> i think that vanessa is the best actor in the cast she makes sam one of the best character on the show james cann is also pretty good i love it when he worried about one of my favorite scenes in when ed and are beating the crap out of some guy that was funny nikki cox is also good and she has great chemistry with josh lara flynn boyle was awesome in her guest role i wish they hadn't killed her off the show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on tv i still think vanessa is the best though she should have got an emmy in my opinion it's a shame the show was cancelled
<START> the sole reason for someone wanting to see this film would be because of john leguizamo i remember the previews and it looked to be another second rate comedy but the fact that mr leguizamo starred tried to redeem it his name how known it was at the time or not tried to sell it br br i was pretty disappointed with the performance of leguizamo his days on house of an in living colour clone were his tip top there is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy and we'll just say that leguizamo crossed it tenfold he looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera as a matter of fact i'll say that he tried too hard madcap humor spilled over into stupidity and the film was spoiled i can't say i blamed him if you were given this opportunity you'd try as hard if you could right your eagerness cost you dearly though mr leguizamo br br the pest follows in the tradition of any comedy film and plays the race card and more no group is left out from being poked fun at blacks latinos whites jews koreans germans homosexuals and the blind are among those singled out again here things get too overboard and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time the resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to normality br br when you have a film and you're going to bypass plot and reality for comedy's sake just make sure it's funny or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film which would sum up leguizamo's pest quite nicely
<START> a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning br br i like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island subtract all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this br br the acting is i would say good there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish get's her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with manuel the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is away and he won't even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she doesen't get approval for her actions she's a victim br br i recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience
<START> what can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden hose the acting particularly that of lead man jerry o'connel is embarrassing the dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe the controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre infantile teen comedy but somehow the director manages to make the least of it i rate it a 2 out of 10
<START> i laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether i adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these beautiful tableaux gives us something else here shows us something i had not seen since his last film he is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives our little lives it is powerful stuff it is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity everything in front of the camera is anything but simple attention to detail is extraordinary i believe most scenes if not all are sets built from scratch according to his designs i cannot recommend this film highly enough for me it took me to a place and i came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful starched and pained barren and splendid at once alien and familiar this film is brilliant and life affirming i know because i came out smiling feeling wonderful it has taken him seven years to make this if he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats
<START> here is a rundown of a typical rachael ray show br br 1 the awful theme song begins to play and rachael descends wearing her outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator 2 she begins running around screaming and or insulting the audience then yells at them sit down 3 an awkward monologue br br the next are in any order 4 a segment tooting own horn i e i lost 500 pounds with recipes rachael ray saved my life fashion tips 5 a totally useless d i y tip i e how to words into casserole dishes how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it 6 the unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience reaction shots of first bites are never shown 7 a celebrity guest with an awkward interview followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience 8 a person who gets help from one of cronies i e the i say yes to everything woman the i own nothing but overalls lady and the i can't find time to put on makeup housewife what would they do without you rachael gasp br br reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague 1 fakeness rachael ray claims that entire show is unscripted many people who have attended of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show br br 2 her show jumps around too much where as oprah who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show jumps around like an adhd soda child on crack her show averages perhaps 10 short worthless segments a show on second you will be getting fashion tips from and the next rachael will be making gross stuffed spanish peppers with cheese and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage and the next well you get the picture br br 3 rachael is a poor host with bad ideas aside from her grating personality hosting ability is terrible at best her questions for her celebrity guests are poor and often times not even relevant to the interview and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational or humorous value br br in conclusion you need not waste your time with this schlock it will be canceled soon anyways
<START> the dea agent's name is a nice inside joke this is the name of the former drug czar who almost single handedly made marijuana illegal br br despite this bit of book knowledge the writers go on to have the farmers harvesting and selling fresh leaf rather than cured buds br br additionally i always find it amusing that movie makers never seem to be able to find real marijuana plants for filming you would think there would be a business that would make real looking fake ones for the movie business or maybe they could film a couple of scenes in amsterdam or switzerland i suppose that's asking too much for the budget br br probably the most interesting thing about the film is the attempt to cover the notion of exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law treads that line and yet tries to do justice in spite of it br br
<START> cassie sandra bullock is a hyper serious police detective as an ex boyfriend once tried to kill her and indeed left her grievously wounded she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice as the result of her near death experience also cassie favors one night stands and trusts no one one day a woman is found dead in the woods near cassie's community she has been murdered heinously beaten severely and left to die alone naturally cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers assigned to help her is fellow officer sam ben chaplin he soon discovers cassie's relentless attitude and all consuming instincts when she asks him to pick up a sample of vomit that has been left at the scene for analysis among other actions the trail soon leads them to two high school students richard ryan gosling and justin michael pitt could these teenagers really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect joy killing this is an intriguing film but viewers should be warned that the subject matter is grim indeed killing for the sport of it is seldom the topic of films that are of the all sweetness and light variety and this one is no different that said the cast is great bullock without a hint of her talent for comedy is terrific as the police officer whose own past compels her to lock up the evil folks of the world chaplin too is quite nice as the detective who is both attracted and repelled by the forceful cassie as for gosling he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul the production values for the movie are good too with appropriately fine costumes settings and photography if you are a fan of bullock's looking for a laugh this is not the one for you but if you adore mysteries even those with the grimmest of plots you will find this tale enthralling
<START> when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak
<START> sometimes you're up late at night flipping through the stations bored out of your mind and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar and this movie fit that exact billing sure the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s the writing as schmaltzy as the hallmark greeting card company's legendary poetry and the one dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from central casting but it was cute and exactly what i needed last night br br lauren holly and costas mandylor have great chemistry together i liked it on picket fences and i'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later costas mandylor at 41 is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol' rudy valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady i always thought he was something straight out of a hepburn grant comedy bravo br br some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made and i would probably have to agree but come on it's on the hallmark channel what were you expecting just sit back relax eat some sesame sticks and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of trust me you'll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more and then you can go to sleep dreaming about costas mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing ps now i have a hankering for petit fours thanks a lot hallmark br br i really wish the evil girl had been cast with rachel ray and maybe that dishy food nerd alton brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the van beard shudder br br that would have made my night but hey check out just desserts
<START> definitely not your typical redneck just never worked for me the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process in their attempt to get away the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them while i could cite a number of problems i had with the movie i'll focus on the most obvious Â the character memphis played by telly savalas from his work in the dirty dozen and heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as kojak savalas was a winner i've always thought of him as one uber cool customer unfortunately savalas is almost unwatchable in redneck did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre it's appears to be random lunacy and what's with that accent savalas might have been a lot of things but southern isn't one of them he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent beyond that i found little of interest in the rest of the movie as i indicated the plot never drew me in i just didn't care about what was going on and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesn't ring true as for the other actors mark lester is almost as bad as savalas and the usually reliable franco nero isn't a whole lot better three name actors and not a good performance between them to make matters worse i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots i couldn't tell what was going on characters i hate a plot i don't care about and a production values that failed Â little wonder i've given redneck a 3 10
<START> life is comprised of infinite possibilities some known others a mystery and destined to remain so and what of the vast unknown the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters who is to say what exists or what is possible valid questions all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic in k pax ' directed by and starring kevin spacey and jeff bridges in the wake of an incident in new york's central station a man named spacey is transported to a psychiatric hospital in manhattan where he is delivered into the care of dr mark powell bridges who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient who claims to be from the distant planet k pax it quickly becomes a challenge for dr powell as with his calm direct forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce he eats bananas peels and all and red delicious apples are his favorites is quite convincing but it's powell's job as well as his nature to be skeptical claims however remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of dr powell who finds himself in something of a quandary even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for k pax a scheduled return trip that allows powell but a short time to sort it all out and powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly if he is ever going to know the truth and he has to know the truth after all is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind br br has created and delivered a sensitive thought provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is in fact possible and as you never know for sure about until the denouement you are able to identify with powell seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that just may be what he says he is and in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around how do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves while at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident not only in but in dr powell as well all of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama br br as we've come to expect kevin spacey gives a brilliant performance as presenting his character from the inside out emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time this is a unique individual and spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself for this film to work it is essential that we believe who and what is we do and it does spacey simply pulls it off magnificently it's a memorable performance from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long long time br br jeff bridges meanwhile emerges on equal footing with spacey adeptly making a very real person of dr powell it's a fairly straightforward role and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right which opposite the character of was no small task and again for this film to work it was necessary for bridges to rise to the occasion and with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is he succeeds without question bridges infuses powell with an underlying complexity and is so giving in his performance that it makes the interaction between powell and vibrant and at times intense it's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring it's a great job by bridges who never attempts to steal the spotlight from which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch br br the supporting cast includes mary mccormack rachel alfre woodard dr ajay naidu dr vincent kimberly scott joyce conchata ferrell betty and saul williams ernie an entertaining emotionally involving film k is a dissertation on possibilities as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition it's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it in the end it makes you realize just how real k pax is and it makes you appreciate journey and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us human or alien and it may just make you reflect upon your own journey where you've been and where you're going and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 10 10 br br
