<START> an obscure horror show filmed in the everglades two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the of the locals who or what are the blood stalkers after awhile they find out watch for the character of the village idiot who like a chicken he certainly is weird
<START> how to take charles darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick his pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes in one of which it is claimed he is killing god pure to make the movie emotional and the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry anyone who actually read origin of species would be vividly aware that there was no breach with god in any of darwin's work to the contrary there was an increased awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things a good movie about darwin could be educational thoughtful and deeply inspiring even in a religious sense but that would contradict the soap opera intentions of this flick this is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why it makes fast use of darwin's great name only as marketing clout as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression sad that the sets and costumes are so good production values except for the writing were obviously high see it if you want to weep for the loss of intelligence in american literature
<START> i never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that i subscribe to the hbo service now i know better jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part not that he tried jack plays his usual of type character unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the american southwest he is about as believable a cowboy desperado as pee wee herman there is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails he is almost to goofy the remainder of the cast was worse timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of 1978 and the others appeared to be just happy to be there my recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry
<START> auteur stephan explores the depths of love passion and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film br br diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting to the core of the human soul a director he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors superb editing especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end thriller which leaves much to the eye br br what an accomplishment for stephan br br Â  cheers stephan angela sander
<START> i have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since i've seen it br br don't get me wrong i have long forgotten the main story line the relationship between kidman and law that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me i cried for about two hours straight after wards br br it had never previously occurred to me how people in war time could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love we see several examples of this here in both the scenes with natalie portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home i was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind however i am glad i watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own br br the blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since i saw the film his horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me at one point i wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason it only occurred to me afterward that i'd only be hitting a big screen that shows the film's power and intensity at least br br i recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield
<START> i thought sleeper cell was interesting and exciting to watch up until the last episode when nothing happens its f bs you americans portray muslims as terrorists and the americans as hero's its the other way around i hate it when every american tv show ends up predictable i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium but i knew it would'nt it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day yet again americans are the biggest terrorists g bush the leader of them all he is to blame for 9 11 and i'm p off that you keep throwing these shows at us which are all the f same i've a good show about terrorism its called the and bush himself the cell leader its the same with 24 how ever 24 was good sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2 its f joke and so are you american producers
<START> i find myself alarmed that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism the many similarities both structurally and literally with 'amadeus' aside the deliberately chooses the easy path by putting audience before art and therefore denying the world a discerning intelligent and creative work br br now consider the following is it not possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony may actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and equally so in a dramatic telling beethoven was completely deaf by the writing of the symphony Â isn't that more interesting how was the symphony conducted wouldn't it be great to know so ask yourself what possible motivation could a filmmaker have for introducing a woman as the copyist if there was a copyist he would certainly be a man what was his story please try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a woman composer br br fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve a writers purpose for those who find themselves comparing and justifying the invention of anna with the invention of claim to have murdered mozart in 'amadeus' consider that he confessing to a priest in a lunatic asylum schaffer uses this device to great affect in the film may have worked if anna was a figment of fevered imagination but we are meant to believe she is yes and that strauss was assisted by aliens br br most of the positive reviews i've read here so far are often expressions of a desire for the film to be good almost a deliberate amnesia remembering the film for what you wish it to be rather than what it is br br for those who believe that fantasy justifies the means then consider you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events but also sacrificing the truth for the sake of a triviality br br finally a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you ed harris is not good as ludwig van beethoven does that shock you he looks awkward throughout the film much like an actor dressed up but off set and standing at the catering table most of his lines are said as cues rather than replies to anna lines i e he is not listening to the actor he is quite clearly an actor masquerading as the character rather than being the character br br really how many times does beethoven have to roll in his grave before we get it right just ask yourself would ludwig approve
<START> i love sandra bullock she's one of my all time favorite actresses but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash canned i realize that it's almost 20 years old but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did beware it's not even worth the 5 50 walmart rack you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks the sound quality is horrendous there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog and it looks as if it were filmed on a 1 98 budget i thought that i'd like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress but yikes is too kind a word to use
<START> this movie is one of the poorest adaptations of a fabulous book that i've seen jean george's novel is a fantastic book that i think is an outstanding read for any child i can't give the same endorsement to this movie
<START> this is just a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst films that i have ever seen
<START> i have watched this movie quite bemused i am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a rob zombie type affair or an exploration of real events br br in either case it missed its mark it's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story br br the performances were neither compelling nor bad br br for me i would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect
<START> i'm a fan of judy garland vincente minnelli and gene kelly but this movie just left me cold i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli so perhaps i was expecting too much br br the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as on the ship i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown too bad the song was so annoying i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with a check lorna autobiography for some interesting information on that scene br br actually the movie has what must be some of cole porter's most annoying songs especially nina also judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children br br the plot is thin which is par for the course for musicals but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor please some movie find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been
<START> the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts but when i located them i could see that truth in this case was stranger than fiction judith light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role the mark i think of an excellent performance rick schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent no matter how criminal they may be one can find fault with the movie but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based
<START> you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold schwarzenegger while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor compared to brigitte nielsen he's sir john gielgud in fact this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self destructive football player mark so instead of this being her break out film this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one note career it was obvious too that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well because the supporting cast aside from arnold is pretty lame and the script is dull dull dull fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film
<START> chili palmer is tired of doing movies and know wants to do some success in music being half mafioso half expert negotiator he wants to rise in the music market however know everyone is like him and making the good singer linda moon to record a hit will be harder as expected the first part is funny and filled with irony this one falls into the easy jokes and has many less good moments only the two women uma and are decent in their part most of the film is done with histrionic character excessively exaggerated a little is ok too much is disgusting and the only one that one could save is the gay bodyguard who at least is coherent the rest are too much idiot the most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring everything happens so quick and there are so many things happening that you do not have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie it may insult your intelligence a lot and the movie is bad yeah but well it's not boring
