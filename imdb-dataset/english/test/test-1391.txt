<START> todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever the story is great the gore is grand the psychos are wicked yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times br br despite this delivers what any zombie movie should gore good plot fast pace adventure into the if only mr sheets had been given a 100k budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead br br but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better br br just remember that zombie bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he is atop of gore mountain
<START> abc's version of the life of the late pope they put it just slightly ahead of cbs's version and it may have suffered from that but the program itself was excellent it moved fast since it only had two hours with commercials also taking up time to cover this great man's long life but thomas kretschmann admirably was up to the challenge he did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and strife that john paul endured he unlike the cbs biopic played the role from youth to old age and managed to seem realistic at both ends of the scale his credibility never wavered he has an amazing range and depth it is a shame that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working within the time frame they did have i think they did an excellent job bringing it to the small screen
<START> is full of energy and it's honest realistic and refreshing not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in barcelona for one year beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack if you're older this movie should bring back a flood of good memories if you're young learn by this example
<START> i've seen worse films this is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause it rest firmly in the realms of the low budget b movie sci fi genre br br it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket awfully charming rather than just plain awful br br the highlight for me is when lover goes to rescue her upon turning up she exclaims which draws from his co pilot br br sit back get drunk enjoy
<START> this film was made soon enough after karen's passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people closest to karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems as the years have passed almost 25 to be exact it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity richard has spent the years after karen's death endlessly and the recordings he made with her he married his cousin mary and from what i have read it looks like he may be planning a next generation carpenters with his children he seems to have regretted making this film and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form it seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was karen carpenter
<START> richard utter insanity cartoon 'the big is a trip through madness enjoyable backgrounds melting characters and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime i see it br br this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv it never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably and then reach down into the depths of my spirit highlighting the greatness of the human condition br br cause when someone says 'come on let's finish the game' everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour but it is far more than that this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial br br it is flawless in every way and damn funny too br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years surely it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon apocalypse now the doors the dog's heart russian film really the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they play no they live as if it was happening to them notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them the hate and love in one piece and the final scene br br really i'm still under impression of that film it's very hard even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy but if you succeed and did the impact would be twice strong br br i compared it with one flew over the cuckoo's nest i like this film either and the novel itself is good too but after movie it seems simple the same difference i noticed after i watched the film american history x and romper the latter is deeper i mean milos forman only showed the material point of view of the problem you watch it then you say yes it's a good film i like him i don't like her and that's it but angels leave you a wide base to think there are no bad and good boys in the film cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do like the girlfriend of one of the patient of course she's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic but the feelings and emotional experience of her are even stronger the result is his suicide why ask him what have he done aren't you insane yourself to ask why do not support him help him understand him finally it is even funny when those people talk to each other they say genius things there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film but i'm not so good in english but i'm sure those of you who have watched the movie understand me br br good luck br br
<START> having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s most being quite good to superb and only very few being mediocre my opinion is that this one is the worst of all br br in fact i think it's so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series it's not that the story is so bad although it's not particularly outstanding in any way but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters meaning those other than the regulars in this case barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer and who is on a mission of a sort she practically calls in the role from a phone and shows no real emotive abilities here although usually she's never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film tv roles usually small parts she has done much better br br arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term and is the only actor ever on a 1960s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison and he gets to play a shakespearian actor no less which gives him more impetus to overact and he does so br br other than these two leads being so weak the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre teens his reply was yeah you're right br br skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before
<START> so one day i was in the video store looking for a movie i came across this and rented it because it was a film i hadn't seen or even heard of br br now i like slasher movies in general but this is just abysmal not even good for laughs besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction i have ever come across now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had but not here painful example of home made horror
<START> not your ordinary movie but a good one billy bob is very funny in this movie the way he talks what he says etc i was kind of surprised when i saw it cause i just thought it was a normal comedy but it was more than that it had a very good story great characters and a good balance br br favorite part probably when billy bob is running around in his robe shooting at the
<START> what a production what a waste of screen time and money here is what some european so called producer think of a scifi movie take former model alexandra kamp pair a with an us c class actor and get one of film business most notorious producer harry a towers towers then finds some obscure munich based prod house tandem communication bauer and then mix it all up with no script whatsoever and you'll get a priceless gem among the worst movies ever done get a live people and do something else whatever you do no movies please to top everything producers went to south africa for filming what you see on screen is one giant sand hole where the action takes place between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that any film student would do better
<START> in the muslim country of fictional its benevolent leader dictator reed hadley as amir is dying of cancer amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds his body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation the population does not know of his death consisting of his doctor and mohammed out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant the surgery is being performed by the disgraced dr kent taylor who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants one of them is about 3 feet high master blaster did indeed run barter town and the other is a mutilated traumatized 7 foot giant named gor what could possibly go wrong br br did i forget to mention deathbed american blonde barbie wife tracy or that dr kent has a dungeon with female slave test subjects delusions of grandeur how about a brain transplant that didn't take there is a lot of double dealing throughout this and people are killed but i'm not going to lie to you anymore mission accomplished the ends justify the means if you can accept that then you will not have to waste 80 minutes i hope that is warning enough don't say i didn't warn you if you must watch then don't watch alone and have plenty of medicine standing by br br celluloid rehab
<START> if you been there and done that you will absolutely love this film i have and by there i mean underground clubs and house parties where there is far more rare to find people just being drunk than it is to find people high to their ears on speed or lsd br br by that i mean dancing and sweating like crazy for eight hours or so in a row with out even a brake and that followed by a way to long morning of no can sleep and almost wanting to die followed by a week of just waiting till the next weekend to do it all again br br so even though this film now is one of my absolute favourites i can certainly understand why some people or most people even would dislike it
<START> sadly this movie is not very good but does it really matter we all know the basics for the story and this has nothing new but i love low budget horror sci fic camp classics so i forgive this one about thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie is that little leonardo dicaprio made his debut in it br br he did ok the part didn't ask for great acting skills and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway little leonardo dicaprio was very cute and so was the girl the movie is fun if you like horror sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them
<START> simply put paul bettany and jennifer connelly were remarkable the movie is less about the raw science of darwin's beliefs and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family primarily his wife emma and daughter annie br br toby jones gives a wonderful turn as thomas the great defender of darwin's beliefs and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with bettany and connelly br br but it is those two who carry the movie their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end but develops transcendence as darwin grapples with his demons the scene where darwin relates the ending of the story of jenny the orangutan to his dying daughter annie is utterly gripping the world premiere audience at the tiff was spellbound bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order equally magnificent is connelly's work playing the religious wife of a man who in huxley's words killed god br br the film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of darwin's grief relishing every detail of bettany and connelly's acting br br brilliant
