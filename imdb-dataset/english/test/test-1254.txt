<START> oh god why didn't you give this money for charity i thought i saw the lowest crap by now but i was wrong who did this script anyway a retarded who did this cast i can't believe that there are people that spend money and time to do garbage like that i was under the impression that i'm watching a porn movie only without sex scenes that bad was the so called acting did this film have a director i believe not and i'm convince that everybody had upon them a page with some lines and red it in front of the camera i can't explain myself how all the characters in this garbage died without a fight nobody can do lower than this please erase it even from imdb bleah
<START> i purchased this video on vcr tape in a good will store for us 50 cents i have taken quite a few videos i purchased back for them to sell to others after i viewed them considering the 50 cent cost as a rental this is the only one that will never go back it is an explosion of artistic talent color and sound i don't know if i should calls it circus dance or both it is bigger than life itself they will only be able to do this well for just a few brief years in their life these are the performers for the performers if gene kelly and burt lancaster were alive today and saw them live they would be awe struck i would lend it to others to watch but i know if i do that i will never get it back
<START> sometimes when seeking a movie nothing will do except a good thriller dead line certainly fits the bill br br a little warning however if you are going to watch this film you are better off not knowing too much specifics about the plot br br the plot thickens as the film goes by a really remarkably well built tension mounts br br it is deep and horrifying it goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind br br the plot also has some very surprising shifts br br just wait till nightfall turn off the light and watch this film
<START> this is a very interesting acquaintance two fisted tales contains three foolish and childish episodes genre isn't actually horror or action more like something in between where's the suspence where's the fun where's the common sense definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it you don't necessarily miss it br br first segment is called showdown it's a violent absurd western i failed to understand the whole idea of it king of the road is a stupid story starring brad pitt at the time of two fisted tales he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic talented actor one of the big ones of the younger generation story is almost ok in all of it's stupidness final episode yellow is the only segment that's almost entirely successful it's foolish but funny we have to thank kirk douglas for that br br this movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn i should know that's what i did if you loved tales from the crypt you'll love two fisted tales too because basically it's all the same i understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare piece of art and very difficult to find anywhere i have the whole package on vhs but i don't think it's a big privilege you'll have to be a fanatic brad pitt fan to search it out otherwise don't bother it's not worth the effort silly crap
<START> i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves 'the never ending story' this is one that would bring back memories of that movie even though it is a 1996 movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommended completely
<START> this is definitely a must see film the excellent director alain chabat also acting as ceasar has managed to capture the very essence of the adventures of the french comic books it's based upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only drawback is that a non french audience or at least a non french speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessened however it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without gÃ©rard and edouard baer and please don't ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books et contre cÃ©sar and directed by claude
<START> hannibal spoilers hannibal lecter anthony hopkins is back for a travesty of a movie now he's in italy appreciating our food including people such as rinaldo giancarlo giannini but comes back to the states for clarice julianne moore and to even the score with a former victim mason verger gary oldman br br let me tell you this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the lambs and manhunter because it's truly completely absolutely totally bad br br i mean the scene near the end with ray liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain wtf then why the hell was everybody so annoying including clarice and why did the story keep going nowhere i suppose that this is the chapter of the hannibal series terrible stupid gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing br br don't watch it especially if you love any other of the hannibal movies manhunter red dragon hannibal rising br br hannibal 1 10
<START> i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version i rather enjoyed it either way it wasn't that bad of a movie sure it moved a bit slow at times i liked it br br as far as mst3k goes they only did the movies they could get the rights for not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies it was just so easy to make fun of them take for example br br joe estevez and robert characters where so inanimate and boringly silly i couldn't help but laugh i couldn't take them seriously it really created a unique feeling though br br vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today her role was played well not too not to masculine but just right the camera really likes her in this movie i would have casted her in that role after ready the script br br anyways this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given please watch the uncut version if you see the mst3k it deserves that much
<START> as many of the other comments i have read have noted i fell in love with this movie when i was a kid my sister and i had a copy of the movie on beta before vhs that we wore out of course it didn't help when our parents sold the betamax at a garage sale since then we have been trying to find a copy i like another commentator did eventually locate a rental copy at a local video store the owner would not part with the copy after any number of attempts to beg bribe and cry my way to owning the tape good news i bought a brand new newly released vhs copy of midnight madness for 9 99 on amazon com two days ago finally disney has wizened up now if they'll only song of the south if you love the movie grab it if you haven't seen the movie it's worth a check totally stupid humor but a lot of fun stephen furst is hilarious
<START> before going any further i have to admit that i only saw the first episode of this show if i had the time i might have considered watching it every week if only to see how the season played out however it was very clear to me from the beginning that martha stewart's version of the apprentice just doesn't fit in martha stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker a domestic diva of the likes of oprah winfrey and julia child it was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character sure she was compelling for a while and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business does she have to come off as cold and tough shouldn't she br br but the truth was by the time stewart came out of prison her attempts for a public comeback though certainly warranted were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed instead she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once the other being her syndicated daytime series martha much like her old show but more mainstream with famous guests like bette midler of course even at her peak stewart was never mainstream so it's too much to ask that american audiences immediately accept her foray into reality tv maybe america wants stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it br br the show was basically a tired retread of trump's apprentice which still holds my interest depending on the tasks the cast and trump's firing decisions often controversial likely for that reason the letter bit was certainly not clichÃ© but obnoxious in the least the fact that stewart never says you're fired mentioned in the message board on this site is particularly distressing producer mark burnett should be admired for dealing with stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman again never mainstream stewart lacks the and of oprah winfrey and the admirable charismatic toughness of donald trump yes this can be a gender biased assessment of her character but i mean it to be more about the nature of her business br br it comes as no shock that stewart has been fired but i wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season
<START> i'm a fan of low budget b movies and campy horror flicks but this was too much even for me br br if you can get past the weak plot the cheesy effects and the uninspired acting then the horrible writing will kill you or you'll wish it would the dialog was most likely written by high school stoners who thought that saying sir yes sir over and over again made these guys sound more military br br the characters were all the typical cardboard stereotypes gung ho sarge sorta gung ho other guy with sensitive side evil scientist with secret agenda bald or course bitchy brainy chick who would be hot if she tried too dumb sexy chick with vital piece of information idiot genius nerd random other sorta military dudes who die soon enough and spoiler character alert crazy scientist who was in charge until something went horribly wrong oh yeah i almost forgot there is a secret military navy submarine sitting on the ocean floor 5 minutes from hq or so it seems full of radioactive scorpions ok and dead bodies your mission is vague and poorly defined br br if you watch this don't say you weren't warned
<START> this movie strayed too far from novel for me to enjoy barely made it to the middle of the film besides changing don from edwards nephew into his son the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life what was left was trash version was far superior to this poorly executed film i don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the chowder society members either hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime i just hate when hollywood butchers the works of talented authors because they think their version so much better makes me sick
<START> as soon as the credits rolled on saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back br br watching those iconic moments where christopher eccelston met billie piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure br br with this new series it brings with it in which the previous version of the show lacked for the emotion between the doctor and his companion which they seemed to dismiss in the old series as well as the doctor actually falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return yet as we know the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of season 2 proved he could not stay with a companion forever watching those moments your eyes filling with tears as the doctor says his final farewell to the only companion he has ever loved were moments beautifully written and acted br br this show however proved it can live on as the doctor meets many other companions along his lonely yet exciting journey through his never ending life br br new doors and secrets every episode it's a sure show for the family to enjoy br br as christopher eccelston once described the show the journey of a lifetime
<START> oh dear oh dear oh dear br br to think that films such as this were made and probably enjoyed by thousands at drive ins really boggles the mind how innocent we were in those days br br to put it bluntly this film is crap the hero is so wet you can hear his squishy damp footsteps in every scene my lord but he's just one of a whole slew of awful awful actors that appear in this turkey no wonder mst3k picked it the story such as it is centres around a stock car driver who is so incompetent you really believe it is the actor driving the car that he gives up and gets in with the wrong crowd oooooh scary stuff however the wrong crowd turn out to be the biker equivalent of the three stooges and their hand me round slut of a biker chick as an example of how lame this whole thing is the writers obviously wracked their brains to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang if four people can be called a gang that is the result the gang is called satan's angels i kid you not br br such dire acting and dialogue along with ridiculous scenes make for a wonderful beer and chips movie but otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish br br as i said once this may have been considered good but today it just makes you laugh and cringe with every minute that goes by avoid it except for a good laugh and make sure you're more than half drunk too
<START> this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty and sometimes shrewish seeming wife and crazy in law s with this show it's fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service he has a pretty wife carrie leah who works as legal assistant and senile father in law arthur spooner jerry stiller who lives in his daughter and son in law's basement kevin james' doug is your typical beer drinking sports loving tv watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny kevin james' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason
