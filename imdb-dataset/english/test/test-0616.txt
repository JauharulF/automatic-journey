<START> bill jeremy is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet bill also has an odd and strange habit he likes to follow people br br bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway metro and follows them as if he were their shadow maybe bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine maybe it's because it fills bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her or maybe it gives bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop br br one day bill follows cobb alex haw home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following cobb bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it br br amazingly good low budget movie made by christopher noland in 1998 before he hit it big in hollywood with his ground breaking and original motion picture classic momento some two years later that has already become a major cult movie br br following is actually a much better movie then momento because it's a conventional and easy to follow story compared to which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated whats makes following so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it the movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like momento did following is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending if you watch the movie again and notice the clues that you'll ever see br br made with an unbelievably small budget of 6 000 00 thats less then what most hollywood movies budgets out for coffee breaks with a no name cast in black and white and just over one hour 71 minutes long hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of hollywood can learn a lot from chris noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars
<START> bled starts as young female artist sai sarah meets a mysterious yet charming man named renfield jonathan they end up back at her studio apartment where he gives her the bark of some sort of tree which is used as a hallucinogenic drug when melted down sai quickly becomes hooked as she is whisked into an alternate fantasy reality which involve vampiric creatures photographer friend royce chris ivan becomes concerned about her as she drifts further from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug can royce her kick the drug or will it end up ruining her life why did the mysterious renfield get her addicted to the stuff in the first place do the elaborate fantasy dream like trips have any significance br br co produced directed by christopher hutson this anaemic arty vampire flick is pretty much 95 minutes of tedium is throughly deserving of all the bad comments the script was written by the interestingly named essex how the hell do you even pronounce that anyway who is also credited as production designer his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in bled i would guess that the makers set out to make a very serious fantasy based horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs drug addiction date rape drug at it's core the majority of the film is spent on the drug issue with initial introduction to the drug how great the first time was how she becomes hopelessly addicted which eventually destroys her her life her friends lives it's never explained where she keeps getting this drug from as renfield only gives her a little bit during their initial meeting but hey who cares the first twenty odd minutes of bled are really boring dull the following hour or so aren't much better before a mess of a final ten minutes which involve a vampiric monster renfield making a reappearance the moral elements are patronising the fantasy elements seem like an afterthought the horror is none existent there's also the dialogue which is awful every sentence tries to be profound have loads of hidden depth just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes tiresome to listen to br br the concept of the film is terrible so is the execution as there's absolutely no gore or violence to speak of the entire thing is set inside an apartment that doesn't appear to have any lights the fantasy setting looks a little better but it's sparsely seen underused there are no scares here no atmosphere to make matters even worse the makers have decided to used muted very faded colours which i just hate find annoying what's wrong with a nice colourful image it seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a film cool or adds atmosphere which it most certainly doesn't more often than not it just makes your film look dull drab as evidenced here with bled br br this probably had a low budget was shot in los angeles it has reasonable production values but it's all so dull the acting didn't impress me i didn't care for or about anyone which is never a good sign br br bled is a terrible vampire film that goes for psychological horror as well as physical with all sorts of parallels to real life dug addiction what it can do to little or no effect because the whole thing is so dull there might be an audience for a film such as this but considering the other comments not that big a one
<START> i really enjoyed random hearts it was shocking to see such a low rating on imdb but chacun a son and all that i am a big fan of harrison ford but i do have to admit that he was ill cast in this movie and the reason i gave it 9 instead of 10 kristin scott thomas though was just wonderful she was believable and beautiful in spite of being made up for half the movie like she'd been crying for days could random hearts have been better sure but it is very much worth seeing as it is
<START> we were waiting in line to see the good girl an excellent movie starring jennifer aniston when some lady came up with this cheapo mock twenty dollar bill advertising manna from heaven come see this movie she said you'll love it br br she then introduced us to the director of the film now this should have been our first clue i mean in how many cinematic situations do you have the director of the film standing out in the lobby begging people to see it is this a christian film i asked not really caring one way or the other i love jesus no shame in that no she said defensively what a load of crap br br this movie is bad so bad and it's not only because of the obvious christian agenda but because of the terrible dialogue acting that alternates between wooden and and the obvious lack of an editor the film is way too long had it been an hour and a half then maybe just maybe i wouldn't have had to visit the suicide prevention center after seeing the movie br br actually i lie see after an hour of this garbage we snuck into swimfan at least with swimfan we know it's garbage before going in to see the movie we know to brace ourselves and swimfan has hot half naked people the only thing half naked in this film is the desperation of the stars involved whose obvious lack of script offers is anything but hidden and the actress who plaid the nun it's called a personality get one br br the people shamelessly begging for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if i liked my big fat greek wedding then i would love their emphasis not mine manna from heaven right more like if you like glitter you'll love manna from heaven and mariah could actually outperform any of the clowns from this flick if that's not an insult then i don't know what is br br i've enough go see indie films but don't see the bad ones this is definitely one of the bad ones manna from heaven is in need of some divine intervention
<START> it really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie the beginning of the film had some truth in it the partisan af was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the croat af deserted together with their observers in 19 and 33 respectively the aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand bombing but didn't last very long one crew was killed and the other survived the pilot being killed later while flying a spitfire vc the real partisan squadrons were established when raf detached two of its yugoslav squadrons of spitfire vc and hurricane respectively manned by ex yugoslav royal airforce pilots and allotted them to tito's forces on the island of vis even those were never engaged in air to air activities but strictly for ground support so the film was one giant cow manure to put it mildly and the lowest point for its otherwise not at all bad director by some quirk of fate i was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie when dozens of german aircraft were destroyed yugoslav trainers used also in the flying sequences on the military airport the pyrotechnics were impressive and the scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better otherwise the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience
<START> the film consists of the audition tapes of the surrender girls and some footage from previous films it's not hot or even suitable for late night viewing on cinemax only an adolescent boy could be interested in auditions from beyond i recommend avoiding this one
<START> i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour it was more like eastenders goes to sea than in which we serve the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company well at least based on my service in the 1970s some of the throwaway lines are very witty i'm not joining the band of hope just to please some greasy fish fryer my only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to the irish coxswain and his bride to be or the tattooed po and his i love arabella tattoo
<START> this film does for infantry what das boot did for submariners if you appreciated das boot then that is all you really need to know br br this is a well done piece of cinema on a par with das boot basically it follows a company of elite german infantry who leave garrison duty in an idyllic italian seaside town and are immediately thrust into the chaos of the disintegrating russian front br br a good war movie illuminates both the senselessness and brutality of war and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight this movie does that the film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining on that level as well
<START> this movie is awful the script is stupid and of course chase doesn't tell zoey he doesn't love her like every episode ill never understand zoey 101 the show also why the heck does logan's dad act so retarted and its only about zoey and chase what about the other characters its always the same in every episode quinn makes and invention something goes terribly wrong with the invention and brother always gets involved in it if you haven't seen it don't waste an hour watching this cuz you'll be wasting your time this may be interesting to an eight year old well 8 10 but i imagine older watching this retarted film but what can you expect from nick
<START> i remember when i first saw this movie i was babysitting for a friend of my mums and one of the kids suggested we watch it thinking it was the frankly laughable of thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder i was prepared for a few hours of boredom what i got came as a shock a pleasant one i'll admit but still a shock br br now you all know the robin hood legend don't you i shall explain a little robin hood was a saxon criminal money here and there and giving it to people who needed it all the while seducing the beautiful maid marion and vexing the sheriff of nottingham and prince john that's the basics now on with the review br br this movie was released in 1993 and is a take off of the whole robin hood legend and a p take of prince of thieves in particular br br loosely following the legend robin of is first encountered in an arabic prison during the third century crusades and together with a as they were called in those days he executes a cunning escape with a cellmate br br after escaping robin to find his son a foreign exchange student in england and look out for him this robin vows to do robin swims back to england br br he returns to his home castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by and goes through he sorrowful revelation that his father dog cat and even the goldfish are all dead desperate for a familiar face he finds the family's loyal blind servant sitting on the toilet with a jazz mag in braille the hilarity continues throughout the movie br br as with all robin hood stories robin must thwart the evil plans of prince john and the sheriff of who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on king richards's kingdom while he's away br br those familiar with the movies mel brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect after all this is the man responsible for dracula dead and loving it and young frankenstein all the jokes which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie with never more than a minute between laughs br br cary elwes incidentally the only english man to play robin hood in a movie who many of you will know from princess bride brings his cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie and does a wonderful job from outlandish heroic posturing to a wickedly sexy glance he really is amazingly funny and the man looks better in tights than i do br br richard lewis is hilarious as the whiny arrogant prince john with the ever changing mole he gets the sissy boy behaviour down to a tee and his whinging american are great all the way through the movie a mole on his face constantly changes position it starts on his left cheek then over to his right cheek then his chin then his forehead before going back to it's original place this is a subtle joke based on the mole on alan rickman when he played the sheriff in prince of thieves br br roger rees as the sleazy sheriff of is marvellously slimy and nasty and has some great lines throughout the film br br there are some faces here you'll be familiar with from other brooks films for instance robert ridgely playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in blazing saddles another film directed by brooks he likes to add subtle references to his earlier films too with several in this film that die hard brooks fans will easily spot those who watched history of the world part 1 will recognise the music to the song 'men in also when patrick stewart arrives and marion mel himself playing rabbi utters the line 'it's good to be a king' one of his lines in history of the world br br the whole cast is wonderfully comedic even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to them br br what makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes although there was a script of sorts some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves such as the scene where latrine tracey ullman prays for in her bed and he falls through the ceiling landing right where she wanted him which was totally devised and thought out by the two actors br br there are few special effects and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery br br the soundtrack is memorable with some very funny songs and a couple of cheesy love songs you'll be singing 'men in or at least humming it to yourself for weeks br br the rating is pg to which i say bah humbug there is no bad language in the film except in the use of double entendre and one utterance of sh t and violence is minimal in fact i'd go as far as to say non existent apart from a few comedy fight scenes br br a great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy
<START> evil warlord puts a town through pain and suffering not long before they call upon giant stone samurai for help soon comes and really gets the warlord with all his might the revenge climax is really funny as daimajin guys under his feet and crushes guys with his fist and even drives a spike though a man's heart
<START> seeing les amants calls immediately for comparison with bertolucci's movie 'the dreamers' in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in paris actually director philippe garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague sharing the principal actor and even including a direct replica eye in viewer eye about an older film of bertolucci and yet lar is a different film and an interesting one br br the story line seems also familiar the movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 maybe among the best done until now the film is made in black and white and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds eisenstein then as in the dreamers the action moves in the parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art smoke drugs dream and fall for one other there is no direct social comment no real explanation of the background of the revolt the movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters it's like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through it's just that not all the participants may adapt or survive br br the film is more about the characters than about the events and it is merely for the style it will be remembered about the black and white cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes but also when looking at the characters evolution many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune the effect is exquisite yet the length of the film is hardly justified it lasts more than three hours and i doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss actually i am convinced it's quite a contrary br br without raising at the depth and subtlety of bertolucci's movie lar is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of france and of the world in the 20th century
<START> joan crawford is convincingly disfigured as our story starts and of course she get fixed up but she's a bad egg exploiting one guy while living out another guy's anti social philosophy all of this takes place in sweden which is truly bizarre it causes anything and everything memorable in the visuals which are freed from having to depict usa but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake since is burdened and rendered unspecific by the need to americanize everything there is plot plot plot so chatty that you could drown in it and making matters worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie the photography is occasionally nice with odd angles and miniatures incorporated quite well but it's overwrought without ever once drawing you in
<START> when one of my friends recommended this to me raving about how well it was filmed the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film i obviously expected an amazing at least entertaining film br br the two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time br br i understand that this movie is meant to be surreal but even in surreal movies there is something which anchors it down even if it is only in the slightest this movie on the other hand felt forced and fake a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic br br the acting was poor and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but i hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between su and before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film then again maybe this film was just bad br br i am not against violence in movies but in this one almost all of it was just unnecessary throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully clichÃ© it all was br br and the plot the word laughable comes to mind i would be amused if i hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot despite all the movie's flaws by the end of it i was expecting something interesting to conclude it i won't discuss the ending because i wouldn't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it just that the metaphor be it a rock or a grain of sand in water they sink as the same cannot be used as an explanation for everything br br this entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is i've seen many other great korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed oldboy as the best
<START> i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to with the wind' should ever have been undertaken having expressed that i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film making the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe
