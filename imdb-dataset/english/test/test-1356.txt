<START> i saw this on a cheap dvd release with the title the entity force since i enjoy cheesy 80's horror films i thought i was in for a real treat sadly the film is mostly boring and you're constantly waiting for something to happen it does eventually get somewhat interesting but this is in the last quarter of the film it's a case of too little too late when the action does happen it's not that great what we get are dead corpses along the ground and chasing after the girls in the mausoleum it's not the absolute worst i've seen but you can do a lot better i would only recommend this to die hard collectors of cheesy 80's horror
<START> this movie was sooooooo good it was hilarious there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it john turturro and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete and delmar i love those guys i love the adventures they went on too i definitely recommend this movie br br also the music in this movie is terrific i love singing along with all of the songs
<START> this is my all time favourite movie ever br br i remember seeing this when i was younger and since then i have been in love with it i used to rent it so often from this one video store that used to carry it and when we moved i couldn't find it any where so i kep going back tot he far away store just so i could watch the movie again br br finally i found it for sale and i bought it and watched it over and over again great movie br br since then though it was my very first dvd that i got after i got my dvd player ok well i got them at the same time the quality on the dvd is way better i couldn't believe it you gotta see this one
<START> i don't need to say much about how good this documentary is it's truly an amazing piece of true narrative the story is simple enough a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in florida and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side it's very enthralling and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human ways you can't help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true story br br it's a shame more people haven't seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch it for those interested in race relations in the united states and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process it's well worth your time and effort to find this documentary i give it a 10
<START> hilarious film about divine retribution camera work stinks shot on digital video and looks like early mtv videos turn the other cheek by looking past the visual and concentrate on the story laughs galore for those with a well developed sense of irony
<START> two years after this short the last our gang short was made after seeing this you wonder how it even lasted that much longer the quality of our gang nosedived soon after moving from hal roach to mgm and this short is a perfect example the gags are all very unfunny and last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time a very poor example of film making
<START> highly flawed but just about watchable comedy' that runs like a farrelly brothers reject the most criminal thing about it though is the casting i couldn't for one minute believe jerry o and jake busey in the role of who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could i believe the very beautiful shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions although the gross out' meant to be shock scenes one involving an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank are just plain awful if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored but please don't waste your money renting it
<START> we're in a not so distant future globalization seems to have reached a high point languages mixes with each other although english prevails over the rest races have merged human is a fact and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones the one for the valid and the one for the non valid a brave new world in huxley's style in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden for health reasons the code 46 of the title in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other br br winterbottom had an important story with quite a big potential a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm narrating it in a so weary way removing any emotions coldness that's all code 46 transmits coldness and boredom not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins both of'em play their roles wonderfully nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie what a pity br br code 46 what could have been and never was br br my rate 4 10
<START> a very well directed version of eric stage play well worth checking out for great characters and for anyone who wants to see how to bring a play to the movies correctly
<START> i had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate so i didn't know what to expect i checked it out on imdb and got curious it didn't take long to realize that this was a gem outstanding performances great story and it's both well directed and well written it's hard to compare it to other movies but stand by me comes to mind although it has as many differences from the cure as similarities the tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and stand by me other than that the cure is a fine movie in its own right well worth a wider recognition it's dramatic but also adventurous sad but also humorous i can't think of a single thing that bothers me about it having said that i don't want to give the impression that it is a perfect movie whatever that means but rather that i enjoyed it immensely was very moved by it and wouldn't change a thing in it i won't go into a detailed description of the story plot partly because it would be either too general or too revealing and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site in closing i can only say wonderful movie see it if you get the chance
<START> in many ways the perfect movie the incredible journey and horatio alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism in essence the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie life's like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending they create their own reality which has all the trappings of every epic tale a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle laden journey an ever increasing group of like minded individuals for camaraderie a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption and a big budget hollywood ending because darn it all they can br br only jim henson could pull this off he walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without too long or too hard into either of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets but in the end perhaps they are the perfect uh puppet to make these points the movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the hollywood dream the happy ending unnecessary cameos and bursting into song at the drop of a hat usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film but the self deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt free viewing one of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all ages br br the other muppet related films including the empire strikes back while palatable do not touch the simple grace of this film take for instance the musical number hope that something better comes along the duet of kermit and rowlf amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices brilliant
<START> 2 37 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully elephant and kids although by my point of view 2 37 is a superior film to those three ones before watching this movie my expectations were neutral but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay k perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors br br the sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies tv programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness discontent and specially madness some people may say that 2 37 arrives too late to that artistic movement however i do not think like that because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories br br on the characters from 2 37 we can find clichÃ©s from the juvenile cinema from director and screenwriter john hughes rip 's movies to the teen horror films the beautiful princess the clumsy nerd the athletes etc it would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which in more or less degree any person can find on his her road to maturity br br 2 37 is an excellent movie whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements it will be very interesting to see next projects since he has had a great debut with this movie
<START> there was broadcast news and what a good thing it was this one just plain stands up and sounds its barbaric in a manner that resonates two decades later br br there are moments especially with respect to the cutesy score when this film becomes a bit too eighties or a bit too sleepless in seattle fortunately they're few and far between br br one third social satire one third romantic comedy one third drama with three flawed but endearing people at its core it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny holly hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role and yes i'm including raising arizona her other star turn from that era in this assessment br br a legitimate classic
<START> i'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film how sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience br br i had major problems with jennifer beals and her character i found alex extremely repellent face is so young sweet and innocent and this very incongruous with alex's very disturbing lewdness especially in that disgusting restaurant scene she also has the temper tantrums of a toddler it is very difficult to believe that nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him opting rather to walk home in the middle of the road with only one shoe and what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet in fact the whole romance was very disturbing the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16 yuck br br as for the dancing i'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated what on earth was that tv dance sequence about in the club who was supposed to be dancing i wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag and even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company the camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing and what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them and as many other comments have pointed out she would never get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end of the i actually thought the best sequence belonged to cynthia rhodes penny in dirty dancing you could see that she was a real dancer and her acrobatics were very impressive this is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup br br there were two good bits in this film the ballet dancers stretching when alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition they look so lovely and classy and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to the other good scene was the break dancing in the street i also liked the ice parents they were funny br br some other random points who was hanna and how did alex get to know her what was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone how did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture where were her family was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary the person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a disney film needs their head examined and anyway what happened to the ice skater br br many people said the film was poor but they liked the message don't give up hope keep on trying and your dreams will come true watch the little mermaid instead
<START> if you had a mother that described you like that you just might be looking to bump her off yourself it's how danny devito feels about anne ramsey it's just how to put the plan in action br br and his creative writing class taught by professor billy crystal gives him the idea that and a viewing of alfred hitchcock's classic strangers on a train which gives devito the idea to switch murders with crystal who hates his wife kate mulgrew who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write but is also carrying on with hunky tony br br throw momma from the train plays out kind of like strangers on a train as devito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme but crystal's having a bit of a problem putting ramsey down even with danny's help that woman might need killing but she's going to take a lot of it br br the only academy recognition that throw momma from the train got was an academy award nomination for anne ramsey for best supporting actress ramsey lost to olympia dukakis for moonstruck but the film turned out to be her finest hour ramsey already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year but look at the list of credits she managed to even after throw momma from the train she worked right up to the end br br i've seen interviews with both of the stars of throw momma from the train billy crystal and danny devito and both have gladly conceded that anne ramsey's performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them their acknowledgment of ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute br br if marion lorne in strangers on a train had been anything like anne ramsey here farley granger would gladly have joined robert walker in disposing of her throw momma from a train is one of the best black comedies out there should not be missed
