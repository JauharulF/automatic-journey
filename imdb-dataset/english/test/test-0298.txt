<START> sometimes it's hard to judge how bad a film made in italy or spain really is because they all seem to use the same stable of 9 10 esl trained voice actors to supply the english voices for release in the us and things are always lost in translation anyway dialog character shtick and plot elements written for the expectations of european audiences may not go too well with our american ideas of what is funny hip or dramatic i imagine that the team responsible for making the translation for the sound track of this movie to english had about 3 days to do it from start to finish and they probably each earned the equivalent of an installment payment on their used to do it in other words pure tossed off in one or two takes and never reviewed or redone by someone with a real ear for the american language br br watching devil fish i can imagine that if you were an italian watching this presented in your native language you might find it a mildly amusing little piece of fluff you'd laugh at the 'in jokes' and the amusing drunk you'd gasp at the monster and the villainy of the bad guys and you'd ogle at the attractive pair of peter and not quite daryll hannah as they couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of a search for clues about a man eating monster who has already killed one of their friends br br but since the jarring voice acting and tin eared dialog keep yanking we americans out of the film experience we can't help but notice that the editors had serious attention deficit disorder that no one on screen can really act so much as project an attitude that the stated reason for the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense that the action sequences have all the impact of a cereal bowl full of cooked oatmeal and that the director screenwriters and producers really hate women br br don't even think about buying or renting this movie watch only on cable tv on saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your fist or with the help and protection of mike and the bots on mst3k
<START> i'm not sure where to start with this in short it was a disappointing movie having taught the novella i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella br br for one i was expecting an older and a younger in the book is fourteen but he is described as pure ideal innocent whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease he is an accomplice to he always looks back at him almost in the book it is who steals glances at the boy as for i imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas mann's brother heinrich than this forty year old with hardly any gray hair in all fairness i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job but either someone else should have done that or he should have made to look older at the beginning br br i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and inspirations and focuses instead on obsession of and does not justify it i liked the fact that music was used because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story i'm not sure turning into a musician was a particularly good move or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book br br and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i'm thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema and here are their characters laughing without sound then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces i'm thinking of the scenes when almost collapses and starts laughing this scene could should have been the strongest but it was annoying instead
<START> this is one of those rare comedies where try as you might you can't help but giggle chortle guffaw and yes even laugh out loud the lead actor's performance as hyde is pure manic genius see if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation good luck on the downside there are times when the movie does bog down it seemed longer than its 90 minutes
<START> maximum risk is quite surprising to a person that has seen more then on of his movies director ringo lam made an average action movie that can be compared with most of the other mid quality action movies what is a special predicate to a muscles from brussels movie it has a quite classy style an interesting atmosphere and last but not least the natasha henstridge even vandamme doesnÂ´t make you crying by his acting he does a relatively good job of course you may not compare maximum risk oh what a creative title to ronin but after watching knock off itÂ´s the hell of a good movie in special standards of course
<START> time does extraordinary things it's the ultimate judge time has granted married to the mob an extra doses of freshness there aren't any dead moments or cheap shots it's more of a delight now than it ever was michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it's as far away from a caricature as anything she's ever done a true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique the legendary dean stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it's just as menacingly real as he is hilarious and matthew modine why did i think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with pfeiffer i was wrong they are wonderful together they reminded me this time to the barbara stanwyck fred macmurray of remember the night i'm writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this jonathan demme gem
<START> a british twist on harold and maude driving lessons features a in rupert and an over the top julie walters while it is true that is stone faced like a redheaded benjamin braddock for the first half of the movie it does not deter from the quirky family film there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell shocked reaction the chemistry between walters and carries the film though laura linney's hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable these performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like stevens john and salsa make this kids popcorn flick worth a saturday afternoon
<START> i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era but i'd be lying through my teeth very uncomfortable position if i pretended that this big screen spin off is anything other than an abomination the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses and nothing improves from there by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book the horrible dragon of a mother in law turns up unexpectedly to stay is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black father moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self righteous ignorant rage most discerning viewers will have switched off take that as a warning unless you're keen on spin offs with terrible acting static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage
<START> over the years i've watched this movie many times from seeing it on hbo and i now own a copy on dvd i must say it's very memorable and entertaining in the meantime it's interesting and educational too as any tv fan can relate to the time of the early 90's when the time came up to replace johhny carson the tv living legend of the tonight show who's it gonna be jay or dave this original film from hbo the late shift stays true to form and depicts the real events very well showing the behind the scenes battle between networks heads of nbc and cbs and even abc they were all fighting for the services of jay and dave the acting makes it seem real as very little actual tv footage is shown with real life people as the actors portraying leno and letterman make it seem so real i haven't read the bill carter book so i don't know if it stayed true to the pages but i have highly enjoyed this film over the years from the moment when it starts showing cbs entertainment heads watching leno sub for johhny and they decide they want to get in on the late night game yet when carson announces his unexpected retirement nbc wants to stay loyal with leno yet conflict arrives when letterman wants a crack at the slot at 11 30 too it was fun to watch the wacky meeting with michael treat williams who makes all networks want to consider letterman for a show it was interesting to see the scene of johhny telling letterman by phone in a direct way to walk from nbc and consider cbs and by the way rich little was terrific as johhny carson his portrayal couldn't be matched and plenty of tense moments were provided by showing the bickering and firing of leno's talent manager helen which nbc heads pressured him to do overall great film that showed what tv is really like and it proves that networks are power and money hungry while showing that's it's a cutthroat business clearly there's no business like show business great work from hbo very memorable and a watch anytime it showed the true story of the late night wars

<START> i really think this movie deserves some oscars i really don't care what people can say badly about this movie because it's a really well played parts from samuel l jackson and mainly by christina ricci i'm a big fan of hers right since i saw her in addams family been trying to watch all things she makes and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played i love her looks even though people say she's not pretty i think she is and i love her eyes the movie is about many things people say that is religious people say that it's about racism people say that is about drugs people say that is about nymphomania well maybe is a little bit of all that but what i truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is what it stands for and mainly were it comes from life heart pain sorrow and above all spontaneous feelings i hope you get to see it if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells this is a good movie to see if your not well see it anyway cant hurt that much and you get to see christina ricci acting so horny she's a fox
<START> is this a bad movie br br of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond br br it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or schindler's list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure 100 adolescent fun br br there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video br br every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so unashamedly i say again if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it
<START> when the budget doesn't allow for a cadillac or packard or lincoln or imperial hearse we are talking cheep cheep that's bird language for cheap cheap br br what is in the hair of the forty year old teen boy the guy who looks like a cement head who tries a couple of times to run over john agar and provides the only scare in the movie by how close he comes his hair looks like a shoe a patent leather shoe he is a shoe head br br the nurse woman needs immediate emergency hair washing she has lacquer in her blond locks that would ignite if the production company had been able to afford lights br br the monster the music was scarier i would try to run from the music the monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast put some lipstick on that monster and you've got older sister br br the camera work and editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout br br hello mr agar we're thinking of doing a sequel to night fright and mr agar agar tom willett
<START> do not avoid this movie simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind don't expect a good movie expect the worst and it will be even worse than that i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection right next to anchorman
<START> i though this film was okay i din't think it was great it was a bit too slow for my taste lots of drama but not very much action until close to the end of the film this movie was basically a dramatic film with the payoff if you can call it that not until near the end to me the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the town were okay but much too brief the film itself is done okay the acting is decent but it just didn't do it for me in the long run think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie at least that's what i think the other factor is that i had just recently watched '10 5' and its sequel '10 5 these are 2 big budget event movies which in my opinion are a very hard act to follow in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction as a result i have to rate killer flood the day the damn broke at 4 10
<START> i found it almost impossible to empathize with ricci's character in this film if she was supposed to be a depressive i think the screenwriter and director neglected to research before making this film because ricci's character was more a depiction of a self centered worthless sh than a victim and survivor of depression br br the forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her br br sorry but i couldn't buy it this is straight to video schlock i'm glad i didn't pay to see this
