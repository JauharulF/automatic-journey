<START> terry cunningham directs this sci fi network original all is not well in washington state and oregon volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the pacific rim in the ocean trying to keep the world from plunging in ecological havoc a crack team of scientists led by dr jake rollins luke perry take a massive earth drilling vehicle called the mole to chew its way to the earth's fiery core to avert impending doom technical dialog doesn't really help or speed this movie along the acting is lame but then perry has always been laid back you can only blame him for taking part others in the cast michael dorn adam frost and michael
<START> the philosophical meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind i'd give it 10 stars for that alone that being said though what hit me with particular force was what i take possibly incorrectly to be its art direction many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated color model and complementary juxtapositions this makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes but to me very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself i think this movie is genuinely unique for this quality and if for no other reason earns it a full careful digital restoration fox are you listening
<START> naturally along with everyone else i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way br br yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the custer story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clichÃ©s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early 20th century br br for instance even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real life custer br br 1 his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and is a clear aspect of his character br br 2 his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid br br 3 custer's promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i half expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene br br 4 custer's stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky br br 5 custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored br br and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy co as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didn't expect to see it portrayed quite so in a movie like this br br and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the 7th cavalry and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way br br all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk
<START> excellent drama very dark i have never seen california photographed in such a way bridget fonda as the deaf wife beaten by her husband is superb the film gripped me from start to finish very understated performance by sutherland the direction was very european amazing to get such a performance from fonda
<START> i enjoyed this film very much i found it to be very entertaining for me in that i feel that it captured the romanticism of turn of the century irish american culture there's no messages there's no violence and there's no overt sex just wholesome 1947 style entertainment and dennis morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs a really good movie
<START> you thought after surprise that german comedy can't get worse it can this comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy the initial concept openly gay men in soccer sports would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes but the real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh so different from straight men absolutely silly of course even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex this movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men well don't waste your time on german comedy movies
<START> i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it it was funny at some parts and some very nasty the only person i felt sorry for is horatio sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women but he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film
<START> my first impression when i read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very very different from the book the movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in america she meets aiden an aspiring graphic novelist working in a chocolate shop in the day she must accept that she will never be normal because every full moon she becomes a a thought to be mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf br br most of the little changes didn't sound too bad to me even though i am a fan of the book with the shared titled by annette curtis klause i knew it would be different but i wanted to see it to support the book thinking that an age change a setting change and a few little occupation changes wouldn't impact the storyline as a whole enough to make me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets and leave myself bleeding on the movie theatre ground br br the movie unnecessarily killed off many important characters one being mother right off the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father i pushed that aside and ventured forth into the movie weary and slightly annoyed running through romania the camera angles were decent the scenery was beautiful and the music was interesting but it left me with the impression of why does vivian look like that and why is she wearing a hoodie jumping to later parts of the movie i must say that i am surprised that the screenplay writers seemed to support incest in a way and rather than sticking to the character relationship from the book between vivian and rafe the leader of the five now became her cousin through her surprise aunt astrid who in the novel was the bitter and hated rival of mother and might i add no way related to either of them br br to top off character distortions gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed over vivian being his mate so they could fulfill some nonexistent prophecy not only did his physical appearance take a complete 180 from the description in the book he was apparently also the father of rafe yes that's right it's a nice little incestuous knot of all bundled up tight br br little things that irked me were scenes like the forest hunts there was a red head that stood out from the rest of the crowd the one who kissed their enemy before their prey was set free to run and be hunted why was she there why did she look like astrid i suppose my mind is not vast enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why she existed other than to kiss pretty victims br br i loved how the amoeba was completely cut out of the movie i loved how legally entwined past was what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he was telling vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self defense and then beat his father up in self defense to make him seem like such a tragic character br br character are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary at the end of the movie i felt as if some person skimmed over the novel scribbled down half the list of character names drew a few connections here and there mentioned that gabriel was a bit of a jerk vivian fell in love with aiden he fears her when he finds out she is a of the legends and somebody is killed by a silver bullet and there is some sort of happy ending because vivian finally feels accepted by somebody who loves her for who she is br br i gave this movie a 2 10 because the camera shots were relatively decent and the casting could have been worse but as far as directing goes why do the leap into the air in human form as if they want to fly with their arched backs and penchant to leap from high places shimmer briefly and then fall onto the ground as wolves the only aspects of this movie that even had me watch it through to the very sordid sorry ending were the wolves the beautiful scenery and the eye candy boys br br all together i must say that in order to enjoy this film at all one must be ready for misconceptions strange happenings that are not always explained incestuous innuendos and have either not liked the book or have not read the book
<START> spoiler with plot explanation a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy that pops out from nowhere and no questions asked that went wacko and casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death with every frame movie gets more and more predictable a big disappointment ending seams completely dumb it has nothing to od with the movie itself i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s t this way or other so it may as well have a stupid ending waste of time resources and money actor play is very poor if you think about the dialogs you may find out that family conflict is artificially enforced by poor communication between characters some scenes seam random in summary boring predictable poor pathetic waste of time and money
<START> it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time the historical aspect was great everything else was horrible the plugs for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening thanks for wasted 2 hours of my time when there was evidence it would fly by most of it was just people talking about the place the episode of the show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was i am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this i haven't watched it since it aired
<START> to call a film boring is not something i would usually count as a valid criticism however when a film is crassly made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with and it is slow as molasses with no real payoff i think it's fair to call a spade a spade and the ghost is a very boring film br br a movie that is about as original as its' name the ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past only it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think br br the plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook the amnesia element only makes things worse it seems that no one including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip show there are scenes taken directly from ringu dark water shutter the grudge series and a smattering of pulse for good measure making matters worse the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike making them impossible to tell apart br br there is just nothing to grasp onto with this film the story isn't all that well thought out the amnesia gimmick is lazy the mystery element is un involving and handled with little grace the characters never deduce anything all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot br br the cinematography full of reflections and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist which i won't reveal is nice but often overwrought even the score feels borrowed and clichÃ© br br worst of all the inciting action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame wait you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end no audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature i used to think shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times but even his second rate work like reincarnation a film i couldn't even bring my self to finish is miles ahead of this br br for more reviews please visit www com
<START> i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired years earlier it would have been moving images accompanied by music later it would have been sound added to silents eventually it would have been technicolor cinemascope or imax this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture during all the emotional scenes the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera this interruption is painful at it's very least imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on painful i have no idea who came up with this gimmick but it was the only time i ever saw it used and for good reason in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes wring their hands or overact to such a degree i actually wondered if this was really a comedy br br the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations norma shearer disappointed in love searches for a reason to live she has a friend played by ralph morgan who worships her but she takes him for granted she is attracted to a doctor played by clark gable but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her she settles for a weakling that needs her desperately she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven only to find out later that he loves her after all the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success but she realizes that it's really clark she loves after all confused yet forget the rest just watch a couple of episodes of as the world turns and it'll all become clear br br if your are ever forced to watch this movie hold out for the final scene the gyrations of the actors put harold lloyd to shame it is not to be missed
<START> i speak badly of g i j t m mostly because i think it lacked something that g i joe had yes it had something that g i joe didn't have like celebrity cameos by don johnson and burgess meredith but i think g i joe the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g i joe tv series had most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now it's a good movie but i wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world i m h o br br although violence is what g i joe was built on i'd say that striking duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for charlie character to go out neither was seeing remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobra la felt was rightfully theirs br br it wasn't the best way for the g i joe series to go out but it's better than nothing
<START> this movie has been promoting in everywhere in spain with a huge publicity campaign after watching it you realise that someone has stolen your money paz vega is horrible as carmen sheÂ´s not natural at all and she looks like sheÂ´s making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots the best is when she as an andalusian woman speak basque and leonardo is much better than her as jose but the story is very slow the plot donÂ´t work and the screenplay is really very very bad i think penelope cruz the film was written for her would have been a much more credible and sexy carmen br br what a waste of time and money
<START> watching the last 2 episodes i remembered a tv add from my childhood it showed the wild west very dusty and dry and there is a small saloon a man enters the bar saloon he is thirsty as hell lips cracked etc he has just walked through the nevada desert and hasn't drunk water for days he to the bartender gimme a packet of potato chips while he is eating it we can feel how he is getting we hear a voice in the background saying keep building that thirst build it till you cant hold it any more then blow it away with team the man drinks team a soft drink it feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips the thirst is so intense that i cannot hold it any more season 2 has even more twists and turns then season 1 the ending answers a lot of questions but asks many many more questions hopefully we will know the answer in season 3 but i doubt it because i feel lost has the momentum go a lot further then 3 seasons if the people behind the camera keep up their good work br br i for one will keep watching br br from pakistan with love
