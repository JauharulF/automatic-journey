<START> the aftermath of world war two almost resulted in the death of soviet cinema in the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete standstill a mere nine feature films were released in 1951 and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government following the death of joseph stalin in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years it wasn't until 1957 that director mikhail and writer viktor became bold enough to produce what is widely considered the first post stalin soviet masterpiece the cranes are flying ' one of the finest depictions of war i've seen from any country or time period not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the soviet union but international recognition was soon to follow and film was honoured with the palm d'or at the 1958 cannes film festival br br 'the cranes are is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious humanistic portrayal of war unlike many soviet war themed films of the time it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war time hero and more concerned with the futility brutality and indeed the inevitability of conflict love as a cinematic concept is too often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship and yet the reality is substantially less romantic in the film two lovers veronika and boris separated by the advent of the wwii widely known in the soviet union as the great patriotic war 1941 1945 pledge to marry after the war but tragedy denies the couple their wish driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting veronika agrees to wed boris' cousin mark aleksandr a handsome but unworthy youth the film may conclude with the proud victory of the soviets and a patriotic flag waving parade but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders through the celebrating crowds br br perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'the cranes are is sergei inspired and dynamic hand held cinematography which realistically and captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades in fact only one of the film's sequences joins boris on the eastern front but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind in one particularly impressive oft cited long shot the camera follows veronika as she frantically searches for boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families the hand held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus jostles through the crowd alongside her capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands before unexpectedly above the crowd as veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand held photography the camera he once declared can express what the actor is unable to portray his inner sensations the cameraman must act with the actors
<START> thank god i didn't buy this movie myself i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed this has got to be one of the worse movies i've ever seen i do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets the acting was horrible so was the editing the dialogue everything it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it i'm looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don't have to stoop to watch this joke
<START> when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel york's portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed york's portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin nothing is similar in any way her expression voice or movement br br to top it all off danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible pino does not qualify to play as ricky he's small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and ethel were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky br br overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching a e biography of lucy and desi read the book from lucille ball herself or pbs' american masters finding lucy if you want to see a docudrama before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing
<START> when i read the reviews of pyaar na ho i thought huh it was that confusing to be sure i went to watch the film and what do you know it's a remake of the wedding singer several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit bollywood is no stranger to remakes but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it i groaned so much watching this and i realized i wasn't the only one doing so one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles he shrieks and whines too much why can't he just take it easy he doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler he doesn't have sandler's sense of comic timing rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites but she's no drew barrymore either the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname hi i'm mrs doesn't match up to barrymore's version hi i'm mrs julia i felt embarrassed watching that scene even though i had loved the original the music is not too bad it's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film avoid this at all cost
<START> i own the miniseries on dvd because i love this story so much this is one of the best period pieces on the civil war that i have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war the costumes are great the story lines are great i love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives there is a great balance of good and evil some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch every time something more despicable than the last happens i curse the tv as if they can hear me i love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in it's drama i would advise however not to watch the third movie in the dvd series it's a let down compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return i don't wish to remember how the third movie ended i prefer to live with the thoughts of the ending in the second movie it makes me happy
<START> a wonderful little production br br the filming technique is very unassuming very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece br br the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life br br the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with murals decorating every surface are terribly well done
<START> let me say first off i didn't go in expecting much and watching it at prime time on opening night should have helped i believe it would have had there been more than 20 people in the theater br br it sucked so hard the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie i guess that was their way of twisting the plot keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot br br unknowns until the end of the movie what the eff is a dark ling the cg was cool but i want to understand why cant powers be willed especially if mass murder is the ultimatum why is willing away powers so bad your just normal after right who farted br br roughly 50 of the minutes with just men on screen were shots of them in wife beaters sleeveless t's and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the low riding speedos knowing to ever have been manufactured i swear you could see the start of the one guys well it was close to soft core and of course there was a shower scene and to mix it up it was of the dudes butt cracks were abundant a sausage fest in progress but there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she ambles around the best looking dorm bathroom for around 12 minutes then there was a girl talk pj party the other thing i couldn't get over was the amount of driving that caleb did in his super cool ford mustang gt it was a ford commercial for around 1 4th of the movie br br don't see it or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies then it could be worth it but don't expect anything breathtaking
<START> a very weird psychedelic esoteric and did i say weird experience br br but on at least on one level it did exactly what it was supposed to do it bridged the gap between the silly manufactured hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the monkees tv program and the adult musically growing and evolving and yet still a little silly monkees of the '70s and beyond br br the most important line in the film is mike nesmith's if they think we are plastic now wait till they see how we do it that the monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record they said it over and over in interviews they needed to re make themselves and what better way that to de bunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them and at the same time they commented on our whole society news movies art everything and said hey why pick on us isn't all of this stuff manufactured on one point or another these are the orwellian the monkees represented the persecuted everyman even at their silliest in the tv series pulling down big brother's pants and kicking him in his very deserving butt br br loved the ideas loved the music loved the effects loved the movie but then as peter says in the movie but then why should i speak since i know nothing
<START> i thought this would be funny i did i don't know what happened but i think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting i don't know who this kid is he could be a very nice person but he wasn't right for this movie and the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious for example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then keith david starts speaking or leslie nielsen or marion ross and it's like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad but when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again br br the spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart makes you wonder who wrote this thing i mean it had a couple of funny bits as i do remember laughing a couple of times but right now i don't remember why and it was only a few days ago br br really i'm giving it a take it or leave it rating but i think most people should just leave it
<START> ed gein one of the most famous serial killers of all time he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like norman bates leatherface and buffalo bill he is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time i watched a documentary on him so i know his story pretty well when i saw this i was curious because i thought it was supposed to be like a documentary re enactment but i have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time first off the facts are completely wrong with a few minor exceptions and secondly this was just a stupid hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie this was poorly acted br br ed gein he lives in a small town in wisconsin called but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by he digs up dead bodies as well as brutally murdering people bobby a deputy is on the case to get ed gein only no one knows who the killer is at first just finding crime scene after crime scene but things get personal when ed starts messing with the policemen's family and friends br br of course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story i always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick but for this story it should have been a better acted film not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clichÃ©'d horror film please stay away from this film it's completely pathetic and untrue to the story of ed gein br br 1 10
<START> can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again i got to just where they are in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now ' and smiles what happens after that is there anymore dialogue or action surely it doesn't just end there i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better i love kristen scott thomas does anyone remember the uk tv series she was in about some nuns i am wanting to know the name sean penn was brilliant madonna eat your heart out everybody else in fact the film a bit predictable it was a 'spot a star cast' the ending took me by surprise i really thought she had burnt her boats if you are a fan of any of the stars its worth watching
<START> justine cannot find the perfect mate to make her first time the perfect one with geek friend in tow she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance when she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination problem is how many obvious sex jokes are left anymore how predictable can these kind of movies get a few funny moments here and there but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life if you liked weird science or jokes about the 'fish out of water' combined with identity crisis' then by all means these 90 min you could enjoy
<START> if your expecting jackass look somewhere else this an actual movie and for the budget well done the acting isnt top noth neither is the writing but the directing was there and so was the story definetly worth the rent and possibly the buy if you really enjoy it like i did but for the person who just likes jackass rent it first
<START> altman and scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest american films of the past 20 years boogie nights didn't make a huge initial splash and i still don't think it's received the credit it deserves the immediate clamor surrounding the film some porn movie with marky mark was wholly without merit what paul thomas anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the american dream if such a thing still exists br br for those of you who have been living in a box or a confessional for the past 8 years boogie nights tells the literal rise and fall tale of young eddie adams wahlberg eddie is just a dopey kid from torrance california who wants something more out of life his room is soaked in muscle bound naive americana his dreams are far bigger than his potential but not quite as large as his special gift his bald headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming omni present adult film industry jack horner burt reynolds as the film's twinkle eyed papa bear gets wind of eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie br br before you can say deep throat eddie has changed his name to dirk diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide eyed public fame and fortune make acquaintance as do a bevy of local porn celebs his friends and co workers become his makeshift family but it soon proves to be a sunday picnic like no other as the feel good 70s give way to the coke addled video friendly 80s dirk co begin a dangerous br br anderson put everything he had into this glorious moving epic it sizzles and never fizzles nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after fades from the soundtrack see this one immediately and then watch it again br br and again
<START> i am right now watching the big chill on dvd one of its actors is meg tilly i looked it up on imdb which led me to reading meg's bio which mentioned and reminded me of meg's sister jennifer tilly whose filmography included key west which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows i then read this entire thread of reviews br br wow i really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations br br as most everyone else i wish it was on dvd or otherwise available br br the last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so i wish i knew what network channel day times it is on br br so if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of key west please let us know
