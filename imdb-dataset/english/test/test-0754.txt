<START> the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once you see humanity at its best and at it's worst you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something i implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart that there is only one true thing and that is love
<START> on its surface this is one of the most classically entertaining action comedy romance films i've seen in a long time reminding me of pleasurable old saturday afternoon movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists well timed humor and integrated action beyond this though there is our knowledge of this film's context it has the same elements of casablanca but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country and the world and the consequences of some of their own behavior this adds a strong note of irony to the humor we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future this is a film that you will not regret watching
<START> the china syndrome is a perfectly paced thriller and not slow or boring at all as some people tend to say the transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension build up in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours jack lemmon is great as always as the somewhat nervous plant operator and jane fonda succeeds again in bringing some real emotions into the story you can see this film as a political statement of the time or just as an intelligently made thriller either way it is definitely worth watching
<START> low budget schlockmeister herschell gordon lewis reaches a new low even for him with the gore gore girls a 'film' snicker that possesses all of his technical trademarks badly recorded sound poor lighting and ott gore this would be tolerable even a bit charming if the film at least had an interesting plot blood feast in all its ridiculous glory is a fine example but girls is a total snooze completely unlikable pompous ass private investigator abraham gentry frank is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who's been murdering out of shape strippers you'll stop caring who the culprit is long before these two are wrapping up the case as before the appeal isn't the plot but the creative methods of bloodletting including a girl's fanny being with a wooden mallet and the occasional flashes of then risquÃ© skin but this just isn't enough to elevate the material above tedium
<START> wow is all i could say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to aaron carter is that i really think that you should be in a lot more movies cause you rock i love aaron carter so much hes hot and so i say thank you a lot for making this movie great i really do so wish he would be able to make a lot more movies because he his a great dancer actor and singer i so wish i could sing as good as he could and i've been a fan of his for like ever and i will never ever stop loving him i rented the movie and i've had it for two days and iv'e literally watched it over like 10 times laugh out loud you could call me crazy but that just proves that i liked it a lot if u wanna talk you can hit me up at aol com so e mail me if you wanna i love you aaron carter
<START> eh it's not really as good as the other the villains are actually rip offs of other z villains like cell and even majin with baby being clone super 17 being clone and the shadow dragons being clone s the story is also very bad as it deals with goku shrinking shrinking it deals with him shrinking to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going let us not forget how weak the characters become can't go mystic anymore and is even weaker than pan it's sad i know speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now she's lost all that cuteness and become an irritating whiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way goten doesn't even have a purpose in the series and trunks well i don't know what to say about trunks gt is just an attempt to milk the popular dragonball franchise if you really like dragonball then avoid this series it doesn't even feel like dragonball i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad at least to me and the theme songs both ending and opening are better japanese not american might've been better if san worked on it
<START> a british teen movies which centres around a girl justine accidentally creating her dream man jake in by the use of a virtual reality machine there is only one problem wellÂ not just oneÂ she gets trapped inside his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust it sounds a lot worse than it is i found it more watchable for the reason that laura fraser was starring in it more than the film content indeed she looks stunning throughout especially when she dresses in a red lycra dress in order to impress jake wow if only i had a virtual reality
<START> this comment will probably have spoilers i checked the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoilers but be aware anyways if i say something that you might consider a spoiler and i don't wow best game since super mario 64 i got this game the first day it came out and before i got it i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings yes they already reviewed it before it came out and i was shocked i was expecting something like sunshine because lately all the mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse but this one totally beat the other games the scores on this game even beat halo 3 it's simply amazing br br story not the best mario games are never known for their plots and this one isn't really much of a difference bowser once again kidnaps peach but this time invades the mushroom kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space br br graphics absolutely gorgeous the best graphics on wii so far the water effects are really nice too if you ever see the water it looks so real because the effects they put in it br br music simply amazing the music in this game is orchestrated not all of it but even the ones that aren't orchestrated still sound very nice br br gameplay very entertaining keeps you wanting to play more and more and for me since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot i mean i'm definitely not the only one but this game for me didn't have that a lot now it still kind of did but not to the point like mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad this one never did that br br difficulty there are two types of difficulty because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars which i think is kind of easy but to beat the game 100 you have to get 120 like always and that quest is way harder but at the same time still very fun br br length good length definitely not too short it took me around 15 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars but 120 took me more like 45 50 hours now i didn't play it constantly that much i played first a lot one day then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day then the next two days i played it all day to me though i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short so if you want a long game i suggest getting all of them br br presentation now the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb the way they are it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any mario game so far br br overall this game is definitely a great game and i advise you to not wait until christmas get it as soon as possible this game also is a good mixture of old and new you'll have some levels where you move just side to side or up and down because they'll change on gravity but even the music has some old classics in it so this game seems to be like a masterpiece to me it's my favorite mario game of all time but others may disagree but it's still a great game i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this
<START> when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro and the musics very funky br br this show is mostly well written i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk br br i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories br br this next sentence contains spoilers my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is concocted in spiderman 3 the movie i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it i believe stan lee wasn't a fan
<START> gary cooper michael brandon played the role as an american millionaire who had seven bad marriages but always divorced his wife's with plenty of money to live on michael is in paris on business and goes into a french department store to buy a pair of tops and the sales people refuse to sell him just the tops he has to buy the bottoms or there is no sale nicole claudette colbert listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajama's michael becomes very interested in nicole and they have occasion to meet and go on dates it is not too long before michael proposes marriage to nicole and she is very taken back with his request for marriage since she really does not know him very well however once she finds out she is going to become the eighth wife of michael she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite entertaining and funny don't miss this film it is great entertainment by great veteran actors enjoy
<START> i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin's films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio mechanical nightmarish stuff except it's in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing as they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this 'tower block' a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the 'no things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula rollin created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out 8 out of 10
<START> this movie was absolutely terrible the only explanation i can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast it was actually painful to watch this movie even my grandchildren ages 6 13 could not bear to watch it as far as i know this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason it's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said hey let's make a movie who wants to be in it it's that bad besides luke perry who is only in a small part of the movie i did not recognize a single other actor that's not necessarily a bad thing but it is in this case i liked i and i generally like stupid and silly movies but this movie doesn't have a single redeeming quality the people who wrote it don't have the slightest clue as to how children think talk or act and the movie is a disjointed mess of terribly corny lines and stupid jokes i rarely write negative reviews but this is the worst movie i have seen since man's best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies i have ever seen in my life if you rent it remember that i warned you the fact that some people actually rated this movie as being good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence i'm not exaggerating
<START> i see absolutely nothing funny even remotely funny in this stupid movie an unrealistic silly ridiculous idea just completely ridiculous hard to believe that the main character who seems so articulate intelligent and imaginative would not be accepted to any college even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down the actors portrayed characters straight out of we have seen their lot many a time over in many films nothing new here i found it on late night tv and since there was really nothing else on i watched the whole boring stupid film what a total waste maybe if you are a teenager you may find it amusing films are made for an immature mind so teens go for it the rest no way
<START> ok before i even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie i'd like to say a few words which come from the heart this movie sucks don't go to see it unless you really like sweaty boy bands and wooden acting no plot stories so let's go to why i think the movie is so bad 1 there is not story line there is no plot the director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasn't there 2 the whole thing looks like a big hour and a half promotion for some kind of goth wanna be but still looking like band all guys in school have perfect abs no fat or ugly young people there is no good looking girl in the movie as well not one the main character is either wet in the swimming pool or all sweaty in his bed poor guy must be awful to go on a date sweating like that 3 can those guys do something good with their powers anything good like put off the fire in that old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other 4 wooden acting the main character only has two expressions on his face expression number one sad expression number two trying to look seductive but still seems sad in that boy band there are 4 guys the main his best friend who got into the accident the and the fourth one what was the name of the fourth one i think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film once in the beginning he said the jumping from the cliff using the power won't kill them and second time at the end when he and the lost the girl the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice anyways my verdict 1 is the perfect score for this film guys do not go to see it there is very little action no suspense no hot girls girls a least the actors are good looking what i would advise you people is to get a of this movie that's the only thing i liked about it
