<START> oh my god after having such a promising start critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around clearly very few things were thought out when this movie was made and what was up with scott wearing an earing this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga but more garbage was on its way this was the big reason why i didn't watch critters 3 and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space critters friday the 13th leprechaun in space hellraiser etc
<START> i disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance i can't imagine this as even approaching stoner classic that would be like calling singles a grunge film the movie definitely plods along with a murky plot at times i wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it watching this movie reminded me of watching children play acting and making the story up as they go along br br the characters are wooden the dialog is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected who got killed when what and this is how you act when your friend overdoses complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality br br as for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene enough it was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background neither moving forward or back br br i kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order the acting and dialog would improve or something somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie after 112 minutes it never happened
<START> i have rarely laughed so hard at a movie notice that i laughed at iron eagle not with it because this is probably the stupidest film i have ever seen with the obvious exception of sci fi monstrosity you should also remember that this film is not a comedy br br even overlooking the preposterous plot the idea that a 16 year old could walk into a us air force base steal an f 16 fly to the middle east and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing is beyond belief the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense for example at various points doug masters uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot a steel a control tower and a tent all of these things explode in a massive fireball why the enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper aeroplane being blown up with a firework br br on the plus side i did actually enjoy this film admittedly not in the way the makers probably wanted it to be enjoyed but all the same i laughed at it and later bought the dvd it's also improved by the awesome presence of david suchet as the evil terrorist leader maybe you'll recall him as mustachioed belgian detective poirot overall then the film is a laugh and a light hearted alternative to more serious fighter plane movies like top gun even if it is just as subtly homo erotic check out the man hug between doug and chappy something's going on between 'em
<START> i was looking forward to this and to be honest there were some bright spots but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world the many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascists whining on about their achievements br br i felt it would have worked better as an hour long tv documentary concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored the most interesting being the french town near fighting off a an american wine company's campaign to get rid of the historic forests a socialist mayor agreed to a deal a nicely timed election arrived and a communist mayor was elected who turned it down much to the exasperation of the american wine execs br br hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original
<START> married to the mob was one of the first vhs tapes that i had along with coming to america and grease i still have fond memories of this film after all these years hell i still have the vhs of this film in good condition br br the story undercover cop mike downey matthew modine is sent to spy on angela de marco michelle pfeiffer the wife of the slain mafia member frank cucumber de marco alec baldwin he later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss tony the tiger russo dean stockwell she also has to deal with his jealous wife connie russo mercedes ruehl br br married to the mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny i like the little jabs it takes at mafia life the jealous mafia wife the mob boss that doesn't realize that he is not a chick magnet etc and you like the characters of angela de marco and mike downey it was the last of the funny phase of johnathan demme before he got serious and gave you gems like philadelphia and silence of the lambs best thriller of all time if you're in the mood for comedy married to the mob is a keeper its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays epic movie date movie meet the spartans disaster movie etc
<START> i thought this movie was excellent jon foster is one of my top favorite actors he was perfect as micheal i found everything about it to be great acting costumes production directing photography script and music etc br br spoilers coming up you have been warned br br martha who they had tell the story in the movie was bludgeoned to death by her violent troubled neighbor micheal micheal did this out of jealousy of his brother tommy when martha rejected him and took tommy instead thankfully though they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison although i think he should have been sentenced to natural life without the possibility of parole br br kudos to the cast crew and filmmakers two thumbs way up
<START> this short a formative cartoon featuring pepe le pew concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk trouble is he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and for truly skunk our hero pepe entering stage left being decidedly more attentive shall we say than m cat would like every great plan has its drawbacks but this one's a corker i wonder if jack warner got a call from the hays office over the fact that pepe and the object of his adoration were both male after all betty boop was in part responsible for the production code coming into existance subsequent conquests were clearly and most definitely female very good cartoon but pepe is a character who works better as the focal point rather than supporting well worth watching recommended
<START> i did not like this movie i rented it hoping it would be something like the 10th kingdom i was disappointed when i discovered it wasn't i also found it just plain the acting was bad the characters where unbelievable and the time jumps were crazy i only recomend this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around but i'm sure there are better films with the same thing i can't believe i wasted my time on this one
<START> i had to call my mother a wasp to ask her about this was it really that bad in the 40s in new york surprise she couldn't remember so i told her to see the movie arthur miller in not a screen play but a novel for a change was 30 when he wrote this in 1945 it is a painful depiction of anti semitism yet oddly enough there is a tender story of human relationships the jew with newman the non jew primarily underlying the cruel story the acting is competent and the cinematography is very good br br the only reason i can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it's controversial br br i actually give it ten of ten maybe a bit high but it's so worth seeing
<START> when you read the comment on this film that it's smart and funny political comedy based on true events the only true word here is that it's a comedy if you're told it's insider movie about russian politics it's not there's probably only 2 in the movie from what really happened in russia during that election campaign in reality of the 1996 it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky election campaign well there were pr advisers from the us working in the staff but their role was just minimal the whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie it would be much funnier showing all the president's people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash and the celebrities giving the shows to support all over the place at least that would be true i give it three only because of the respect to jeff goldblum antony and liev schreiber and about the machine guns on the streets of moscow i was living in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in russia in the middle of 90 s and never seen a man with the gun on the street
<START> working the night shift in a seedy police station stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze detective mickey hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions things get truly weird soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim the elusive alice br br the role of an embittered burn out seems tailor made for keifer sutherland and he makes the most of it the plot's typical serial killer stuff but it has enough quirks twists and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget one wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes br br all in all 'after is a pleasant diversion for anyone but for fans of lewis carroll's 'alice' books it's a real treat from the topsy turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem to more obvious references a killer called 'the who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies there's an 'alice' reference at every turn below is a list of the ones i uncovered since finding them yourself is half the fun i've marked them as spoilers br br spoilers br br cast of characters br br mickey in a sense he's alice himself wandering through strange landscapes encountering odd characters but harvey recognizing his true nature identifies him as the hapless bumbling white knight br br john hatter boss is he really you be the judge br br claudette an african american transvestite obviously the black queen br br margaret ellison mickey calls her the red queen but her brutal nature suggests more specifically the queen of hearts br br gideon wood suspected of being the jabberwocky killer his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a or a perhaps br br harvey his role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit makes me think he must be the white rabbit br br dr vera swann her last name and relationship with mickey suggest the white queen br br other connections br br adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a rabbit hole br br mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him cheshire cat br br the killer is revealed the looking glass' br br the climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards just as alice's adventure did in the book br br the statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the clichÃ© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst harold and andy tennant make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies dressed up as hari dancing chanting and playing the tambourine unbeatable the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed the dialogue was so bad it was sickening the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this this movie was shown at a private screening he most likely left by the back door the only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast they had to bite the bullet to get through this one i couldn't stand to watch all of it it was so predictable that it was funny who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy
<START> when i started watching this i instantly noticed that i couldn't understand what anyone was saying i turned up the volume with background noises now booming out i could hear the voices just what are the actors saying is the movie not dubbed are they speaking spanish after some confusion i realize that it was english at least i think so the amazing jess franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors as a result we cannot completely hear what they are saying he's done this before but maybe this is mr franco's intention by not knowing what people are saying we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on and are left with more visual clues maybe it's just me but i would have liked to know what was going on how about a few hints the basic premise i refuse to call it a plot concerns a young american exotic dancer named paula played by amber newman who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people it is somewhere off the coast of spain for this visit a large cash payment is promised to paula which the boyfriend gets he then escapes from the island only to return later why pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens paula's us passport though his hand tried to cover it up you can see the actress' real name amber newman printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport anyway back to the story there are some other sleazy rich beautiful characters visiting the island all with ambiguous motives we witness sadistic games are they real or fake and unappealing dining scenes but the food must be good as a phony french chef prepared it there is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks is she really mute and do we care of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film oh well we can at least be thankful that the 50 and overweight men remain clothed in addition to the abysmal sound quality what i have always marveled at about jess franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off this film is no exception Â i needed fresh air after watching it br br in conclusion i am happy to report that regardless of what mr franco can dream up i am still attracted to women
<START> our gang got one chance at a feature film in its 22 year history and this was the best that could be done it's boring forced and pointless and i must respectfully disagree with the other poster on this film the 1994 little rascals remake was better than this almost anything is the kids are subordinate to the civil war proceedings it doesn't feel like an our gang film at all but like a humorless second rate shirley temple clone
