<START> so forgive the really lame game play scene cardboard background and studio like stadium for this part i should have give the movie 5 instead of 7 but read on br br from the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the replacements some say this movie rip off the replacements while some say this script wrote before it br br both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad br br in replacements the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen before rather than real setting background with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games real stadium real audience and some nfl match alike shooting angle br br but let say both movies came out on the same day and we erase the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall i like second string over replacements not by much but i like this more br br it has relatively better character development in replacements keanu character is too out sync with the world and all he care is maybe get a girl in second string you see the struggle of the from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the fumble guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing it br br how about those trick play i think it is relatively realistic than replacements the dan marino like fake knee pass flea flicker wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacement 's center catch and rushing for 50 yards call or how a 60 yards field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didn't force the te kicker made his shot br br of course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the comebacks
<START> some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the privilege to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes br br spoilers br br the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her the next woman fell on a bed of icicles the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs br br the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying tongue a dude well you have to see it for yourself br br and of course the snowball children kicked ass br br end spoilers br br infinity stars
<START> this film is sometimes called 'the story of o pt 2' which tries to pass itself off as a sequel of sorts to the french erotic s m thriller 'the story of o' although i've never seen the original version i did however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual social politics i guess the 'o' angle comes from the occasional s m overtones which were never as explicit and unpleasant to watch as the ones in klaus kinski is the only recognizable face in this french japanese production but speaks his lines in english at least in the version i saw the unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water it's obvious that after the whole porno chic trend in cinema petered out ouch sorry bad pun about 1975 producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema not to mention foreign art cinema so film goers had to contend with dreck like 'the last woman' and others like it
<START> this is such a revered and studied film a classic among hitchcock's many it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again yet you think can it hold up even when the huge and clever and amazing trick of the plot is no surprise br br yes br br and for starters there is the start a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story the gist of it two taxis two men shown with their shoes each walking onto the train sitting then across from each other and oops a mistake a little nudge and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves they are interchangeable br br the tone here is characteristic of hitchcock as it is in many horror and suspense films cheery and light we know entering the film however that this won't be the case so already we are worried what after all is about to go wrong br br a lot in truly hitchcock fashion it is a purely innocent man nearly always a man who faces injustice who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him the innocent in this case tennis player guy haynes is played with an innocence that is believable his collegiate politeness in that first scene for example as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo is just what you or i might do the not so innocent man is the self absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child bruno anthony played with utter brilliance by robert walker this uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another hitchcock wacko played by anthony perkins in psycho so from scene one on the train and the train really gorgeous we have the two leads and we have the mind blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by patricia highsmith who also wrote the books behind the two mr ripley movies and it doesn't hurt that the screenplay was co written by raymond chandler himself who knows something about economy and clever dialog and crime br br and of course there is more than just the first scene what to note well that smarty of a senator's daughter i thought she was terrific is hitchcock's daughter patricia who is still with us as of 2009 she also had a role in psycho and there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film the tennis courts in the hamptons known to us as the site of the u s open the fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage building up the suspense by making it surreal the fear gets positively with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all and when it collapses in a crash that's all on a set one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections br br the photography is that perfect hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized as in some noir films that it is an object in its own right look again at the first scene or the shooting and editing of haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder this is sophisticated construction when we are not completely surprised that it's bruno in the bed that only proves that the director has us on our toes something unexpected is always expected br br are there glitches who knows it depends on what kind of falseness you can accept or embrace as beautiful style the scene where bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant the woman played by norma is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away and marred by his looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses and her resemblance to his earlier victim this is a mid 20th century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of hitchcock's efforts the end of psycho for starters br br the wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter this echoes in lots of little ways two men trail him to the tennis court two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on there can be too much made of this but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness don't forget there are meant to be two murders it is the lack of the second murder the inability to create a doubling in that case that causes bruno to unravel br br walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot and just afterwards he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts though he appeared in other films strangers on a train is easily his tour de force farley granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works especially in they live by night br br and if you watch this one for the first or third time do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd's heads all move back and forth in unison except for bruno's he is staring out without moving his head straight at us as the trailer for the movie says after this movie you won't be talking to strangers on a train
<START> jacqueline hyde starts like any other normal day for individual jackie hyde co producer gabriella hall until her boss robert donovan fires her for taking personal calls at work however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather malcolm bennett has recently died that he left her his mansion fortune why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me sigh very excited jackie heads on over there makes herself right at home while looking for the thermostat late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance being a bit on the porky side jackie finally settles on the glamorous jacqueline blythe however jackie's better looking alter ego starts to take control br br written co produced directed by rolfe kanefsky i thought jacqueline hyde was complete total utter crap from start to finish it's as simple straight forward as that according to the opening credits jacqueline hyde was by the classic robert louis stevenson novel 'the strange case of dr jekyll and mr frankly if mr stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave for a start i think jacqueline hyde was is intended to be a horror film the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is i would say that jacqueline hyde is more a soft core porno than anything else extremely tame with it why sit down watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard core stuff that actually delivers the goods why that's the question i ask here it's not even good porn either besides being far too soft it's dull boring the not worth mentioning sex scenes are few far between the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the jacqueline hyde 1998 title during the last century judging by the imdb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity br br director kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap the few instances of cgi look like they came from a nintendo gameboy the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect i've ever seen is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when jackie's breasts grow via more terrible cgi that's another thing the film takes itself far too seriously the subject matter sucks is far too predictable makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch alas it isn't so it isn't forget about any decent horror violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end br br technically jacqueline hyde is home made film type stuff the photography is of the flat hand held point shoot variety the music production design special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script the acting was awful seriously this is bad br br jacqueline hyde in my opinion a load of crap there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap definitely one to avoid
<START> whoa i mean whoa i mean whoa whoa br br i saw this movie waaay back when i was eight in 1996 back then cgi films were a rarity and good ones even more so also back then we listened to things called cd players but i digress i used to like this movie a lot way back then and up till viewing it again i've held reaally fond memories of it hey it's don bluth anyone who hates all dogs go to heaven is clearly a robot but again i digress br br then i saw it again this really isn't one of his best i can say now eleven years later i've seen a lot more films and i've garnered a little bit more knowledge now sure the voice acting is good i'll give 'em that story's okay i mean we see it all the time a lot but it works the musical numbers are what irk me this would've been more at home in the eighties with these kind of musical numbers in '96 most kids movies had epic numbers like the lion king which came out a year or so previous but whatever or stuff like that you get showtunes here vaudeville style br br the animation kind of hurts too at times choppy and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot it's really hard not to notice br br i still like all dogs go to heaven but this could've been waaay better br br 4 10
<START> as a zombie fan i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters pb is also an excellent tie in to chronicles of riddick cor the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness there are so many metaphors in the story riddick is this bad guy but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow paced folks the muslim guy imam relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule overall i recommend this film to any sci fi fans you won't be disappointed
<START> steven segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema i have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as i realized that they were even more unrealistic than jean claude has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit i mean give me something to root for a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary twenty years and he's still filming the same fight scenes fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act the boring choreography of a segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief worse yet he's woefully out of shape just what we need a fat stiff who thinks he's a leading man there's not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes do not watch this unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life
<START> a beautiful film john garfield's character is a distant relative of les miserables 's jean valjean while detective rains recalls victor hugo's javert the ruthless arm of law br br like in many films noirs the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary redemption and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed but even in the luminous daylight danger may appear suddenly as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows john garfield an actor who as leonard maltin points out should be rediscovered i've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in gentleman's agreement but it was not his fault gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective rains colorful characters grandma and the kids add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary humor is also present in the strip poker game as the dead end brats fleece a rich kid br br i recommend this movie
<START> it's hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk the show couldn't even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past including rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in tv history not since has had a terrible cooking show host i've watched at least has some good moments and some style this one has no style at all she's terrible as host the kitchen looks atrocious the writing is horrible the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad it makes me sick now i enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style but this has absolutely none of that br br this is one of the worst tv of the year
<START> three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another the one hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over i have seen other segments of the but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure br br the film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen at least in the short 1 hr version of 5 we are made to imagine that this must have been the case a cab driver who is a misanthrope has two facets to his character the good side feeds a mangy dog cleans his cab meticulously picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense and remembers his wife while dying the bad side frightens small poodles refuses to give a ride to a drunk probably worried that he will puke in the cab and ogles at pretty girls the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into without any provocation is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters br br yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill is explored theologically even god spared cain ' sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs and psychologically after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister whose photograph he carries with him what makes ordinary persons turn into killers this is never fully explained but suggestions are legion br br in kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense note the resemblance of clown to the killer as it hangs from the mirror in the cab kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the commandment literally and figuratively why do we kill are the people legally killed truly bad is there a force beyond society the drunken night that led to life of a girl that makes us into abhorrent murderers br br it would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film both without mercy the film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by god not to kill br br i understand a longer full length version of the film was made by kieslowski but even this short 1 hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script intelligent editing interesting cinematography and top notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts br br this segment anticipates the more wholesome 6 7 and 8
<START> this is the first time i'm entering a comment for a movie i haven't viewed till the credits reason for this is simple people need to be warned this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium i usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but i reckoned this to be watchable a regrettable decision which was based on other ashton kutcher comedies that were semi enjoyable such as a lot like love and guess who br br where those two movies had their charms and laughs this had none and i mean none the acting is horrible especially the 'boss' tara reid was no surprise how dare she call herself an actress the premise is thin and the plot doesn't at all not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and or sweet but as you probably already guessed this was not the cast at all the script felt like it wasn't quite finished and i wouldn't even be baffled if the director did some rewrites while shooting my dog could've written a more coherent script seriously and he's not exactly lassie either br br stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goof ball comedies at times like i do this low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many br br i almost never give a one so therefore a 2
<START> well i must say i initially found this short to be quite average but having watched it nearly 5 times since its constantly shown on ifc i've developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented sofia coppola contributes a solid addition to the category
<START> i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term cult flick it is totally a bad movie but i can't help it i like this movie richard boone has made better and so has joan van arc but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that don't make you think to much this one is for you
<START> can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie and when he does it is supposed to be a very emotional scene yet when the operation delta force team kills hundreds of russians in slow motion action scenes or thousands of arabs also in slow motion action scenes you are supposed to cheer and say take that you non american monsters i know i used slow motion action scenes a lot but that is because every action scene in this movie is in you guessed it slow motion every last one of them and this squad should be called invincible slow motion bullet dodging force since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets and if this supernatural power fails they have some kind of regeneration superpower which is all they need to kill the complete non american army that stands between them and victory by this point nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow motion action scene that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story which is what i did the cast is made of unknown actors which will probably remain unknown since they don't even play characters they are just playing guys with guns and lets not forget superpowers the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad although they are in slow motion for a tv movie but it still sucks and at the same time is so bad it's good ok maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive br br 25
