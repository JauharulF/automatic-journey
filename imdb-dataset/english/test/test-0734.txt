<START> river queen's sound recordist should have been fired in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set mumbling voices was the end result and the cinematography was average to fair at best the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming its obvious that the movie was suffering from el cheapo budget syndrome and the scene where is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words br br i noticed a few shortcuts taken on the protocol side of things but this was probably due to movie length time restraints etc all in all i wasn't impressed with this movie the river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold drab and claustrophobic image with none of the beauty the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles less on screen confusion better sound recording and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen br br hats off to all involved though for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo i have the utmost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film sadly i did not enjoy this one
<START> a good story well acted with unexpected character twists eg vicious murderous gangster bryan brown teaching his son although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy ledger and his succeed it also has some hilarious ironic black humour eg the bank robbers who become radio competition winners and their reaction the revenge etc well worth watching
<START> cheezy yep poorly filmed you betcha zero budget they proudly claim it on their posters brilliant anyway or because of it for sure br br this movie celebrates and makes fun of everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre characters with absolutely no depth fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent completely gratuitous nudity impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims slow moving zombies great one liners and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket br br this is not an all out spoof like scary movie but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun silly sexy and goofy good time
<START> lifeforce is certainly one of tobe hooper's best films it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity so it seems like a typical horror fan's dream the film is quit creative though and i think that's because of the script from dan and don nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film
<START> this movie is dated in so many ways it's sensational you can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage br br this movie deals with many problems of american history but with the typical white male christian american paternalism the main character is one of those i can do it all and you've got to love me for it kind of guy he is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time what a horrid creature his wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy but stronger character in the end too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time it's just sad that the character didn't really change at all even though she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman in the end she is consumed by worry about her adventure seeking husband so 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us and those are only for the good intentions the problem of indian suppression is dealt with quite nicely but there is that patronizing story telling again and the fact that all african american characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical i was so enraged most of the time so one point for trying from the civil rights movement br br i know that the movie was done at a different time i love old movies and i have a lot of patience with some of those dated point of views but this was just disgusting br br what saves this movie are the parts without the main character mr dix's acting is way over the top and smug maybe that's why his character is so disagreeable i liked mrs dunne's performance even though her character enraged me at times br br but i must say the famous land rush scene was incredibly done and the way that the oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the movie worthwhile it's just amazing how civilization rose out of the dirt and dust of the 19th century and i don't understand the problem some have with that church scene i thought it was quite funny and amusing maybe it wasn't supposed to be but i liked it so 9 points for those scenes and the impressive storytelling of the development of the oklahoma state that makes about 4 points altogether
<START> after spending half an hour examining rumors a gay bar located outside mississippi small town gay bar shifts focus to the murder of scotty weaver in bay minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects but there is a problem here bay minette isn't near as the film implies it isn't even in the same state it is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal alabama br br director malcom ingram doesn't exactly rush to point out this fact nor does he bother to mention that while bay minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of mobile alabama which has a noticeable gay community quite a few gay bars and even a congregation of metropolitan community church if ingram is disingenuous on these points one has to ask if he is on others as well br br speaking as someone who was born raised and continues to live in mississippi i have to say that i find most of small town gay bar a lot of hooey neither meridian nor the communities upon which ingram focuses are as rural small or as isolated as he would have you imagine and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies that said ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture which tends to hold those who frequent bars be they gay or straight in low esteem br br small town gay bar is in my opinion an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda do gays and lesbians living in rural mississippi face major sometimes frightening challenges you bet they do but that's no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree the dvd includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes but i found the feature film itself so ridiculous that i didn't waste any time on them br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> the idea that anyone could of concocted such a trite clichÃ© yet comical movie is shocking the final 20 minutes of this film are comical glory with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747 while a supposed perfectly lands the 747 in a leading one to question the misnomer of calling this movie crash landing br br some of the dialogue was equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears while the only aspect that saved this movie for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women filling the screen a large portion of the time not exactly a for this pathetic excuse of a movie but my mute button finally received a workout br br view at your own risk 2 out of 10
<START> as main character lillith silver likes to point out you know f k all about vampires it is evident that this statement was aimed at the cast and crew who create an exceedingly bad image of everyone's favourite bloodsucking undead according to the misguided director vampires are all caked in white foundation and crammed into latex similar to a piece of meat in shrink wrap with fangs resembling and a bad case of asthma our main character lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the modern day vampire br br the plot consists of a 9 year old boys' playstation collection jotted down on a piece of paper then blended together to concoct this horrible tale lillith our pale protagonist is a vampire bounty hunter who makes a living from out members of everyone's favourite cult the rather than incorporate the classic assassin methodology of stealth and precision however lillith waltzes in through an open window and then proceeds to chomp her targets necks before shooting them point blank with a handgun that apparently doesn't leave bullet holes thanks to the shoddy continuity pc plod is then assigned to solve the murders he comes to the grizzly yet strikingly obvious conclusion that lillith is actually a vampire and proceeds to hunt her down armed with the usual vampire dispatching tools including a cross garlic and a sharpened piece of wood meanwhile lillith who has gotten into the habit of her boss is distraught when an old nemesis him and demands a ransom to be delivered personally as you may imagine this doesn't go according to plan i'm not going to put myself through the pain of the following scenes however so i'll skip to the end lillith and her nemesis have a showdown and after lillith obtains victory it is then revealed with all the extravagance of someone being told they have cancer that the two are century old lovers and the whole plot was some kind of twisted game yes that kick in the balls was the actual ending of the film in my eyes this joke of a conclusion is the icing on the latex clad cake and seals this film in the never ever watch this vault br br as far as cinematic techniques go the film merely doesn't bother creating any style the director tries to rescue his disasterpiece from the brink by throwing in some close ups and a few multi angular shots this however is not the saving grace the film needed br br you may be screaming but this is a b movie its meant to be crap i however do not take pity i have seen some cracking b movies such as evil dead 2 and jesus christ vampire hunter and therefore this disgrace cannot hide behind excuses the budget was low this is obvious by the lack of location and good actors maybe however if the director was more creative and spent less money on paying for makeup and fake blood he could have done something decent with this sickening attempt the seedy sex scenes are not beneficial in any way and merely served to give me a few chuckles at the obscene acting skills throughout half the budget must have been paid to the female cast merely for getting their tops off for lesbian romps if i wanted to watch a vampire porno i would have bought the vampire layer br br the cast are bad the story is worse and the effects are cripplingly fake this film had some potential however its seedy undertone and embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character merely served to be its downfall br br if you want a laugh with a few friends i recommend you watch this mockery if you are looking for a more serious vampire action flick try blade or underworld to your raging bloodlust
<START> destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized this game deserves all the recognition it deserves at a time when first person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers graphic adventures are a dying breed with great pun and humour the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island prediction the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too i guarantee it
<START> another sequel why on earth do they keep making these this has got to be the weakest ever yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels scarecrow gone wild which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series brings back the evil straw man who again butchers up some college kids that's basically it the acting sucks as usual the death scenes are beyond pathetic and don't be fooled by the title this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think a couple nice topless girls but nothing too pants tightening let me just conclude my continuous insult or review on this movie by saying if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves i'm going to be in absolute awe
<START> this is a classic american movie in combination with comedy romance dream you may say ' there have been lots of these kind of films already but just believe me you'll find this a good one because it's well directed scripted and played amanda just crazily amazing she's humor cute charming both inside outside the screen she's the man indeed the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale what i mean tale' is not the one with prince princess but indicates namely it tells us to hold your faith dream things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't do that one of those movies you can't miss out in your life

<START> the 1990s was a great decade for british sitcom with many popular creations such as one foot in the grave absolutely the thin blue line the empire and men behaving badly arriving onto tv screens for the first time br br however mr bean is hands down the greatest sitcom of the 1990s br br mr bean represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton for several decades it brings to the audience a single character mr bean played to perfection by rowan atkinson br br many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not mr bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability however i believe this debate is unnecessary because i highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider mr bean in such a context br br mr bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others some of his methods to approaching day to day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show this is where the humour derives from mr bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way and naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster which we then see mr bean try to resolve br br sometimes we see mr bean show a mean or petty streak often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it but no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring br br unlike most examples of british comedy in the past 30 years mr bean is simple inoffensive harmless u rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy it is for this reason why the tv series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world it is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other tv shows will have come gone and been forgotten br br some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet i laugh just as much at mr bean's antics now as i did when i first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s rowan atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time br br the tv series has to date spawned two spin off movies bean and mr bean's holiday as one familiar with the type of humour shown in the tv series would expect it does not translate to success on the big screen the two movies do little justice to the tv series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes the greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting in both movies the producers take mr bean out of his normal british surroundings into america the first movie and france the second movie as a result the movie characters around mr bean respond differently to his behaviour than their tv series counterparts both movies re use gags from the tv series and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time in the second movie mr bean is shown to be behaving out of character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny at various times i found myself thinking that the character i was watching was not mr bean but a pale caricature it is clear that rowan atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the tv series his heart just wasn't in the performance after the second movie came out he stated publicly that he would not play mr bean again i realise how he felt br br returning to the tv series each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies br br my favourite episodes are the first three these set the high standard that was to continue i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless br br to summarise mr bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family rowan atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this tv series my recommendation watch and enjoy but only see the movies if you consider yourself a die hard fan after seeing the tv series
<START> when i read the synopsis for messiah in the television guide i was not prepared for what was in store the story follows metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london he soon realises a pattern there is a serial killer on the loose killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill fated victim messiah is sure to cause a great deal of controversy but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time
<START> hitchcock would be proud of this movie even when nothing happens it is suspenseful director david lynch a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse br br altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts and yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme the mood the character development and the filming techniques br br the dual roles of the main actress naomi watts showcase her enormous talent that is when i could get my eyes off of her co star what an acting pair br br lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles the length timing of editing cuts jumping back and forth between scenes combined with smart use of music and sounds it all helps to build suspense in our minds doubtless a major objective of the director well he kept me on the edge of my seat even had me talking to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there you know the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies
