<START> genius or utter madness that depends on your interpretation of this film i responded to it on the level of a self aware cop movie parody and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i don't see anyone taking it seriously d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from his core background in the comedy genre some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard boiled action star i think not br br with the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget fx and zany over the top action set pieces it all kinda evoked that old tv show sledge hammer for me hilarious br br of course i may have totally interpreted the film wrong if it was in fact an attempt at a 'straight' action movie then it was certainly an amusing failure br br watch with lots of alcohol and some mates
<START> 1983's is an odd little film the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s '40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding '80s slasher genre it isn't totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance than the movie deserves by the late german actor ferdinand mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' conrad is a bit of a hoity toity prima donna jerk off just when you think he couldn't be any more un likable the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die still feisty even at death's door he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects br br it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad's grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an '80s horror film logic has no place here the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad's body seated in a place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs distraught over the theft of her husband's body has called in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any friendlier in death psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one this is where the movie falls apart endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying hello is anyone there are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thing but again we're in an '80s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music thunder moans and groans howls etc that becomes severely annoying after a while br br i can't really recommend to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s modern horror fans will doubtlessly find incredibly slow moving and goofy if you came of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from fans of jeffrey re animator combs may also want to check it out as the future dr west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students br br i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the label paired with roy ward's vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible i'm told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma which seems appropriate if you're a troma kind of person then will be right up your alley
<START> scientists at a remote lab experiment on insert creature here and create out of control monsters in the meantime a crack military team the scientist's daughter bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters one by one they're eaten all during an exciting race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters the sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the sci fi channel i have to wonder just what is going on sure i like bimbos and hollywood hunk wannabes be eaten by cgi critters as much as the next person but where's the plot or originality granted there are times when sci fi channel shines battlestar galactica if a bit dark can be very good writers have continued to pump life into the various stargate offerings and the latest bbc import of doctor who is surprisingly good br br even in the various giant animal movies on sci fi the animation seems to be getting better all the time compare the in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant film on sci fi br br but goodness how about a different plot maybe some different giant critter on a whim i started searching around the internet among the litter i found a few interesting stories which might appeal to sf fans and out of work russian cgi animators at once i offer http www com archive metamorphosis day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights the story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various sci fi channel offerings br br the story has subplot ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible did they really kill all the monsters moments but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset br br which is generally what science fiction is supposed to do no
<START> this movie includes 2 well known actors i have previously enjoyed watching there actions are great and each action is heart felt but it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind humping to drive the audience into tears for her release br br the only good part is the acting abilities the plot has the same ruse as hitlers influence and i started to hate the protagonist for that but all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it br br
<START> seriously i'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like 2 of the shows while most of the others sucked as then they comment on music videos which i cannot stand personally while they either love or like br br in most episodes the only things you will hear are the let's go score with some chicks or i'll kick your ass beavis or the better yet and usually used quote that was cool and above all their annoying laugh br br if you want a good animated show try the simpsons ren and stimpy south park this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series truthfully
<START> this disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title based on a novel by japan is located right alongside the pacific ring of fire active volcanoes and also along the edges of plate whose shifting will cause earthquakes and a japanese term in itself for tidal wave naturally this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture what with hollywood having a field day with films like armageddon deep impact and more recently the day after tomorrow which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world br br but i'll have to say this the sinking of japan makes all the films mentioned earlier look like classics this disaster movie is a disaster and a massive one at that having to look at my watch every 10 15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage and feels than it had over clocked its runtime br br the special effects are gorgeous to look at from satellite styled outer space pictures to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun the effects are the star of the show however having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable as too much of a good thing just plain bores br br if you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem then yes in fact those scenes are just that there are no details and everything is seen from afar in a god like mode things happen just like that on screen with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close it's akin to godzilla knocking over buildings and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act morbid as it might sound show us the victims a populous nation like japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale br br trying to weave a romance into the movie it stood out like a sore thumb there are many characters in the movie but each one of them lacking real characteristics or humanity and look like wandering zombies without expression without emotion and definitely very stiff and unconvincing heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements instructions and form policies and react to incidents like it was a computer game all settled with a push of a button these are characters that you don't give a hoot about br br if i may just use the day after tomorrow as a comparison while there are terrific effects there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views and infused within are plenty of action sequences big ones like the disasters themselves and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit that makes it relatively compelling br br unfortunately for the sinking of japan this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff
<START> fata morgana the 1971 documentary like film by german filmmaker extraordinaire werner herzog filmed over several years in the late 1960s is one of those rare dvds that should be listened to with the commentary turned on it is a visual feast of north african mostly saharan imagery that is timeless you simply could not tell that it was made over thirty five years ago the soundtrack to the film including german classical music mozart and and rock music by blind faith and leonard cohen also lends its timeless quality the narration by three different german narrators german film historian lotte eisner des and wolfgang von sternberg is solid and herzog goes on and on of eisner's import to this project himself and film history but the english speaker of the translation james william has a voice that seems downright which lends itself far more perfectly to this project even though much of the text in either language is rather superfluous yes the faux biblical sounds of the mayan creation myth in the film's first part creation is interesting but the text herzog wrote for the remaining two parts paradise and the golden age along with quotes from a german poet herzog names as manfred almost seems a satire of the first part's somber the film it seems was pieced together during the shooting of several other herzog projects concurrently the fictive even dwarfs started small and the documentaries the land of silence and darkness and the flying doctors of east africa but these rejected material only add to the beauty of this film such as aerial scenes of a flamingo mating lake from afar that give one an eerie unearthly sense one which herzog crows about in his commentary this unearthly feel is present right from the film's start of several airplanes landing on a desert runway with their images getting as the heat from the ground rises and increases the distorting waves that mar the images that this film was influential in the films of godfrey is an understatement but whereas is content to just toss images at you herzog has an ability that only american filmmaker terrence malick also has to make a wholly self contained vocabulary out of the juxtaposition of images and words and one dependent upon an emotion first thrust analysis can fail when brought to such endeavors herzog often does not understand even why his art is great the best he does often is wholly unconscious and mesmeric this is why his contempt for the lowest common denominator pap of hollywood is openly stated on the commentary br br perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that on the commentary herzog tells us followed a severe drought in cameroon it shows the carcasses of cattle and herzog describes the unbearable stench yet the viewer can sense this all from the images the blackness of the sun dried portions of animals and the bones yet even in that commentary herzog focuses on the stench not any deeper meaning he is content to let you imbue and interpret what you will into and of his work such as the almost erotically feminized shapes of sand dunes which recalls a scene from ingmar bergman's hour of the wolf where max von sydow runs his hand over ingrid beautiful nude body's curves but the archetypal image in this film which symbolizes much of herzog's career is of a mirage of a faraway car driving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake it is deep hypnotic illusive elusive supernatural yet real just as herzog the believer who came from a family of militant atheists is but then like everything else it ends
<START> this movie is a gem an undiscovered gerry anderson classic br br the origins of both ufo and space 1999 are obvious from this movie including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto ufo br br it is unfortunate that anderson despite his many tv successes did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen just think what he could have done with the movie version of thunderbirds which he quite rightly disowned himself from br br i'm sure if you give doppleganger a fair chance you'll appreciate it's good qualities
<START> br br spoilers in this review br br the long kiss goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films it starts off on a very interesting concept a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers don't know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing and or inane paths leaving the disappointing taste of something that was ok but promised to be a lot better the baddies are remarkably unremarkable and even jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre pulp fiction days it looks like harlin as in cutthroat island made every effort so that no one would upstage his then wife her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren't able to do something better with it br br however there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run of the mill hollywood actioner and places it above average if only just it is something very subtle i can't quite put my finger on it's a disturbing cold dark even sickly edge a nightmarish and unreal feel a decadent air a mean streak which keeps cropping up in various ways it's in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in it's in samantha's dreams in front of the mirror it's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she's about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening it's in mitch's comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak i don't know it's an atmosphere something i can't define but which gives me the creeps a bit and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me
<START> i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love in fact it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother i actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how canadian indian second generations feel about sex at any rate did you know the first hotel drunk idea was copied from a korean movie made in 2001 or thereabouts that korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man woman relationships and man woman difference in experience and thinking i mean most of the neal n nikki hotel drunk segment was emulated take by take can't bollywood movie makers try to make originals only please seriously i never enjoyed a hindi flick that is a copycat the ones i enjoy have always spoken indian feelings through indian cultural means
<START> i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called 'inside i'm dancing' i didn't know a thing about it so had no preconceptions before i went in br br the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs and live in a home michael steven robertson suffers from palsy and rory james mcavoy suffers from muscular dystrophy please excuse any spelling mistakes they form a bond as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in by themselves they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl romola garai to look after them the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman thats the story in a nutshell but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way in fact being unprepared as i was i found the tears were flowing way too often in fact i don't think i've cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man this film is a huge drain on the emotions both in the fun stuff and the sad stuff the acting is absolutely spot on james mcavoy is my tip for greatness he's a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him steven robertson who plays michael was superb too and it wasn't until today that i found out that he doesn't suffer from palsy and it was just some superb acting brenda fricker is also in this film and plays the part of the manager very well the other great part has to be romola garai she was wonderful as the love interest and i reckon we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future br br the thing that makes this film work is not only the between the two leads but the script which is just so witty it literally is on fire i still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head even now br br the photography is good although very bleak but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland the music is great in this film too as well as the choice in songs the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track is inspired br br if i had to sum this film up in one word it would be this film is very very funny and then on the turn of a coin its very very sad i still can't believe that still two days after seeing the film looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry this film is amazing and i hope it goes far although i can't see that as its advertising budget is probably very small br br so go see it i urge you you wont regret it
<START> style over substance but what a style it is the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies unfortunately the story hardly supports the visuals br br psychotherapist catherine deane j lo goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions a new patient whose fallen into a coma is brought to her attention by the fbi he's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim br br director singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion from the landscapes to the costumes br br but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about without him you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway though she's as gorgeous as ever and vince vaughn i don't even know why he was chosen this is not his forte and he overacts to boot he tried too hard to become his character and it showed stick to comedy vince even so this movie is so visually frightening i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward
<START> the four la cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that nick nolte the dumbest looking of the lot is in charge the writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members and the director fails to wring out of the man mountain nolte questioning anyone nolte's character lights a gets mad and beats interviewees to a pulp his methods get him nowhere until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut he smashes up an fbi squad and throws two military officers out of a plane in flight with only a vague report of anger at hq and no punishment at all at the end of the film he is as gormless and muscle bound as he was at the outset how he managed to get a beautiful whore to fall deeply in love with him is a mystery as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his jobless wife two interesting shots in the picture one of an atomic explosion the other of a gigantic crater ostensibly caused by a bomb it's almost as wrecked and puffy as nolte's face
<START> simply put this movies is without any substance whatsoever just take my word for it and save yourself the time it is a complete dud i would say the characters are one dimensional but that would imply there was some sort of character development i thought eric roberts was going to jump out any second it was so close to b movie status br br the girl from that 70's is beautiful but unless you are a stalker type fan of hers this movie has nothing for anyone br br avoid avoid avoid br br this movie was straight to dvd for a reason that being it is a train wreck
<START> once again bugs bunny sacred home is violated by careless people this time the traveling circus put a lion's cage right over the hole so bug's has to come out of the hole and face nero that's the name of the lion which he does in his usual hilarious style after a slow and rocky beginning to the cart it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one if still shorn of a classic this animated short can be found on disk 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 3 br br my grade a
