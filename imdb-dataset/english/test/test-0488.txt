<START> it's funny because i read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction you'll probably either love it or hate it too i think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact i'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about afghanistan and iraq i have to admit that i was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place especially afghanistan and i feel guilty about that the music through the movie was beautiful i kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks personally i thought the audio was great it seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the rv with jim the main character or in his head everything not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio anyway this is a very amazing dvd which made me cry
<START> i'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store wondering if i should give it a shot today i broke down and gave it a whirl and i probably shouldn't have br br while the writer director did give the film a respectable effort it fell far short of engaging the characters while you wanted to feel for them just didn't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them sara's sexual outbursts got tiring fast i don't mind sex in films and i don't mind bitchy characters but being a bad girl doesn't mean you're prone to excitedly ask people at random if they'd like sexual favors by the time what happened to the characters was revealed i was bored and ready to fast forward to the climax the end anything exciting and nothing delivered the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic and just wasn't played quite right if they'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there i might have been interested this should have been a more of a suspense drama film and should have stuck to the title jon good's wife rather than the whole red right hand and horror film like cover hell this should have had suspense period br br either way watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on the television though this isn't as great as i'd hoped i would go for this over some infomercials
<START> i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti do not see this movie if you haven't seen the original i still don't recommend this but it will be a lot less painful to watch the characters from the first film are great and by the end you fell a connection to them this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become it's a chore to watch br br set on new year's eve in 1964 '65 '66 and '67 we have four stories about the characters from the first film in we have john milner paul le mat who is now a professional drag racer he meets a foreign girl eva and though his plot really goes nowhere it's the best of the four in 1965 we have toad charles martin smith who is stuck in vietnam and more than anything he wants out he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out in '66 we have debbie candy clark the girl who toad picked up in the first movie now she is a pot smoking hippie and really i'm not sure what her plot was about it was her going to a concert not much of anything happened finally in 1967 steve ron howard and laurie cindy williams are having marriage problems that end in a anti war rally and police action br br none of these stories are very good the script in some parts features very very bad dialogue these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film ended up where they are here why why was this sequel made i guess if a sequel was made it had to feature the vietnam war and hippies and police action but the real thing is that this movie shouldn't have been made br br the direction was stylish but it just amounts in a huge headache each story has a different style is just a regular depending on how you watch it wide screen and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be plot was shot in 16mm and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen debbie's plot is shot in multi screen at one point there might have been one screen but for the good majority it's anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once don't bother trying to follow the screens since there's nothing going on anyways steve and laurie's plot has the weirdest filming style it's style really doesn't mean anything and is dumb and pointless instead of just a full widescreen it's a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen though i don't like the others at least i understand what they were going for this one just doesn't make sense br br the music is this movie's saving grace not that it could save this bob dylan simon and stevie wonder marvin gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here they don't save the feature they just make it a little better than it is it's still bad br br overall this is a pointless sequel any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel br br my rating 1 2 out of 110 mins pg for language drug use and violence
<START> given christopher nolan's string of successful films it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller br br though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner which at first could be conceived as research before he starts to make up his own rules and break them br br he meets up with charismatic cobb alex haw who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim's livelihood as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a mobster's moll who rejects his every advance br br told in a non linear fashion which comes with scenes that don't quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets duly delivered there are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through br br it's also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends i guess here's an example of a successful filmmaker's humble roots which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there now i'll patiently wait for christopher nolan's inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease
<START> cover girl is a lacklustre wwii musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it save for its signature song long ago and far away this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic stride and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here mostly he plays sidekick to rita hayworth and there's the problem rita hayworth is gorgeous no doubt about that but she's simply not a compelling screen presence i've always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do and this movie is no exception she's simply not a very good actress and she's not even a very good dancer good looking as she is there's something vapid about her and this movie suffers because of it br br grade c
<START> you know i always fancy disturbing or strange movies especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in hamburg germany but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst film i saw this year will this comment contain any spoilers br br no because i just did not understand this movie but well what can you expect from a flick that was introduced to a festival crowd we the guys from the festival know that not all of you will watch this one until the very end br br i like splatter movies and i also like movies with a strong graphical language but this there are a lot of bloody scenes in this one but why what is the director trying to tell us is he saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster who knows i do not br br if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time watch it but donÂ´t expect to think wow i got the message i did not get it
<START> i was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world a hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world for the most part the hispanic culture is shown as i have always observed and admired hardworking optimistic and truly family oriented the points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the catholic church without a doubt the actress who played the mother deserves an academy award her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears i will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family
<START> istanbul is a big crowded city between europe and asia too many types of people living together there for hundred years in this documentary movie you can see how music can give description about the culture of the owner race br br you would be able to hear too many types of music including rock hip hop alternative and more some of the musicians are famous in turkey some of them are famous also in europe the rest are just street musicians their music tell viewers different faces of a city br br impressive
<START> cam archer's lyrical boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering beautifully photographed by aaron platt that is more vibe than narrative caught somewhere between documentary and dream recalls the inventiveness of early todd haynes and the vivid of gus van sant with grit glamour and heartbreak it's kinda like the movie equivalent of sonic youth playing bubblegum pop
<START> to be frank this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer the 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its build up as the first talkie br br danny thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well he does the jewish stuff with feeling peggy lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him one question since when do live in such luxurious houses
<START> i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show these characters were so real one could tell that from the two main actresses ms toussaint ms potts that their relationship on off camera was genuine it didn't just end when you hear those familiar words cut at the end of a take the show has thought me a lot about life for e g historical struggles tragedies and triumphs relationships every day situations every household have same situations no matter who the members are it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself now what did i learn from this particular episode br br i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again br br now you know why i gave it a 10
<START> quentin tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own pulp fiction or reservoir dogs writer actor director larry bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with hell ride and concocted a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals music camera work and time altering storytelling but to properly mimic a tarantino film one has to have a knack for constructing creative conversations unfortunately hell primary element is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved br br the anti hero protagonist biker gang the victors consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless roads the leader larry bishop is hell bent on revenge and putting out fires the gent michael madsen just tries to balance his chaotic psychotic symphony of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss and comanche eric balfour follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past br br on the villainous front deuce david carradine is the mastermind who orchestrates from afar though not quite far enough and billy wings vinnie jones spits venom and lewd explanations for his tattoos while toting a harpoon gun and a general disdain for life while these characters might sound interesting on paper once they're forced to rant horrendously ill conceived dialogue all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for bishop's next film br br while hell ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities the main facet of its undoing lies in the poorly devised conversations and because bishop's main influences are the talky films of tarantino there are a lot of them the first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly unintelligible and would probably make as much sense muted by the time main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overused to the point of nausea you'll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off even dennis hopper has trouble remaining cool while spouting off such goofy dialogue br br have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense anymore bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters on screen getting their heads cut off and when the dialogue finally takes a break we're treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being slashed i'm not sure what effect bishop hoped to attain but i doubt he found it br br hell ride wants to pay homage to quentin tarantino films robert rodriguez films and every movie that idolizes the violent and devil may care attitudes of bikers but while its intentions may be noble the horrendously cringe worthy dialogue and the hyper stylized timeline mangling editing prevents the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough guy characters by the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives and it may be awhile before you even realize there's a mystery to be solved it's just too hard to care anymore and while everyone on screen is clearly having fun they've entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience br br joel
<START> now that's it's 2008 who really has a care in the world about a guy like db sweeney even back then he wasn't a big deal br br two tickets to paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances again a proved plot the problem with this film other than it's 'so bad it's title is the script br br clichÃ© after clichÃ© three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie and blow up white's house br br john c acting job is superb especially compared to that of the late db sweeney's his career is dead hence the late though i hear he's moving to tv good for him also john c likely has the least awful character in the film br br the score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from 1993 or jeff anderson's movie now you know also set me back a few years but at least that was more entertaining i mean yah i guess i enjoyed parts of it but the nerdy guy is annoying db tries to be this cool failed guitar player with some rough influences like some of the worst of classic rock who has some strange relationship with a stripper and john c is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his henchmen br br i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better but i think burning the script would have been a healthy start br br but as i've hinted this whole time it's not the worst movie ever and any chance i have to see mcginley in a starring role i'll take it hopefully he starts getting some better projects
<START> this is an excellent documentary about rodrigues i enjoyed it very much it's very well put together and very informative if you want to know who is rodrigues i highly recommend you see this film the art of rodrigues br br
<START> return of the seven has a few good action scenes and elmer bernstein's score is as rousing as ever nevertheless it's a boring film because it simply fails to involve us emotionally mcqueen's absence makes a really bad impression and the fact that his character here is played by a different little known actor is odd in a bad way the characters are not developed so we don't connect with them and we hardly care when some of them die this sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original
