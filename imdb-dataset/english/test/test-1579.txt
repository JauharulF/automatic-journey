<START> this tv adaptation of sarah waters' novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it not since tipping the velvet also highly recommended have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses this time by sally hawkins and elaine cassidy they acted with their souls and this is what gets across to the audience the supporting actors were well chosen too they made a great ensemble br br for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship no this is only one part the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love and the plot has some further surprising twists so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well
<START> i'd first heard of this show in 2005 first online and then by viewing and of course buying the typically gorgeous bbc tie in book then i got the dvd it did not disappoint i'd been hoping for years someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens laser gun fights and other hollywood gimmicks thank you joe also for your dr who work and the mini series not the crap movie of the same name what compelled me to write this now 2 yrs later was that i'd just seen sunshine last night and what appeared to be in the same family as space odyssey turned into about 2 3rds of the way in freddy krueger meets 2010 that was when space odyssey really stood out as a positive example of how to do a real science fiction film more science less fiction odyssey like sunshine also dealt with astronaut shortcomings failed eva over on venus the spats with mission control and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers the fatal radiation spike on mars i would've easily paid to see this in a theater i max anyone and to top it all not only were the space vistas jaw droppingly beautiful but the characters were nicely drawn too i found their interplay more realistic than the wall slamming histrionics of icarus 2 crew icarus dumb name for a solar mission did anyone read the mythology of icarus sometimes it takes a not so good film to compel one to re watch a better film as an armchair astronaut i'd trade my passage on icarus for a seat on pegasus any day in all fairness however the visuals of sunshine are quite stunning though and quite memorable which is why i was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honest to goodness sci fi film so even though this review is almost a back door review of sunshine i hope it's read for what it was meant to be strong support for a bbc telefilm that succeeds where most big budget bloated cinematic spectacles fail space odyssey a k a voyage to the planets here in the states the appetite for solid science fiction and delivers a banquet i very much enjoyed the pseudo documentary approach as well as for the time lag light speed quibbles they are addressed if you pay attention where sunshine melts odyssey keeps its cool if you're considering going to the movies for another dose of sunshine stay in go for a true space odyssey instead
<START> yesterday i watched this tv production and i was very disappointed br br i didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production but the complete movie was pain with no ending i felt it lasted for 3 hours but it was just me who was bored to death every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the turn off switch br br the movie is about a doctor dr who gets a lot of aids patients and most of them die during the movie it is hard for to live with so his family gets punished with his frustrations however this movie has problems showing both sides it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients and sometimes we see flicks from his home but we don't get much the difficulties to show more than one part of life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from andrews a man i hopefully can't see in any good future movies br br i believe it got 7 6 because of the subject taboo but i'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market stay away from this movie it does not deserve more than 3 10 br br
<START> to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it br br this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up their inventive and comedic series sort of an american idol of their day took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured around them br br this is their take on their manufactured image and status as the 2nd tier beatles they always felt they were in a box trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents br br it is also a hell of a musical trippy inventive i have the soundtrack and full of surprises br br see it with an open mind
<START> when this movie was made in 1980 i was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience this was done at illinois the big letters spelling out at the top of the stands were covered up with a banner in the movie the director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points as if a touchdown was being made st charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than 30 miles from although i think it may have closed down recently during one scene they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game right below them you can see my sister head she was 11 at the time in the vhs version i can only see the top of her head but when i saw it on tv in 1981 i could see her whole head and my sister jacqui as well br br i thought the movie itself was ok for a made for tv movie since there's already a description of the movie here i need not repeat it it's worth seeing at least once
<START> several weeks back i lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen years a golden retriever named sasha when i came home from the animal hospital alone after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life my teenage daughter sat by my side and we talked about this episode of the twilight zone i could be wrong but i recall a line that arthur hunnicutt said when satan was trying to trick him into hell but his dog could not go with him and his dog in turn was growling in defiance at the gatekeeper who was trying to trick the old hunter to step inside that it would be one helluva of heaven if dogs were not allowed and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate of what they had thought was heaven to wander eternity alone what a tearful moment when they meet a good ole' country boy on that eternal road only to discover he is an angel sent out to find 'em and sure neighbor of course dogs are allowed into heaven br br i'll confess i cried as i talked about this with my daughter while we mourned the passing of our beloved golden rod serling was truly a genius a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism hatred know and was a profound inspiration to me to become a writer this episode across forty five years carried a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend i urge you to get a copy the next time there is a one of the twilight zone marathons or purchase it there will be some tears but comfort as well as always thanks rod for all that you taught us even now
<START> anyone remember the docudrama threads it's a drama documentary which shocked britain in september 1984 whilst not exactly wholly entertained by mick jackson's nuclear holocaust horror film i could respect it unfortunately i can't respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later which deals with terrorists letting off a radioactive dirty bomb in the centre of london br br the problem i have with it is that director daniel percival production values are far too good when in fact this would have benefited from rather cheap production values the cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need superb and well lit oscar standard cinematography what we certainly don't need is a musical score as the survivors of the blast slowly stagger out of the smoke neither do we need vaguely well known cast members did anyone else sit there asking themselves hey what was he in i know that face several times i know i did and it's very distracting br br perhaps the biggest production flaw with dirty war is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama in threads the action cuts away from the action in sheffield umpteen times and becomes an edition of horizon on the effects of nuclear war before cutting back to the fictional protagonists again and threads is very effective because of this here the information presented suffocates the drama which drowns in expositional and totally unconvincing dialogue the characters in the teleplay aren't really characters they're just cyphers there to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material is exploded it would have been better for the action to cut to captions to convey this type of information ala threads the worse thing is that director daniel percival used the same technique as seen in threads a couple of years ago with his docudrama about smallpox he should have used the same style with dirty war br br i should also lay my cards on the table and state that while i don't consider most muslims are terrorists i am getting slightly fed up of tv productions like the hamburg cell the grid and dirty war having to point out this fact to me by me over the head with it which is somewhat typical of patronising pc attitudes in tv companies nowadays br br i managed to miss the studio debate that bob mentions here but i have also heard it discussed elsewhere and i can't help thinking it makes better viewing than dirty war itself with its heated arguments between differing factions of the political spectrum if dirty war is remembered twenty years from now highly unlikely i know it may well be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything
<START> i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983 i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players but bill irwin floored me br br i was most impressed at how a man of his size he's quite tall and beefy could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise br br most amazing for me though in this performance was the way he rose to his feet during the jack in the box marionette piece those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo he pulled himself up by the top of his head as if by a string and rose not just to his feet but to a full ballet did it in one fluid seemingly effortless motion just consider the strength grace balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills and there lies a consummate actor performer my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box br br as to the unfortunate tragic would be a better word of this piece in home media form i have noticed that much of pbs' works are not available on tape or dvd sometimes pbs shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast but they seldom stay on the market for long there are exceptions of course but these are mainly the science and history documentaries rarely does an arts piece remain in print for it ever made it into vhs dvd to begin with i don't know why this should be so certainly pbs could use the income from home media marketing of their shows but they don't take advantage of it much this is a shame there are many things i've watched on pbs that i wish to own but pieces such as the regard of flight are i'm afraid a one shot once in a lifetime treat never to be repeated on pbs again and never to be available for home media purchase that really sucks i'm lucky to have caught it when i did br br oh local library did get a copy of the regard of flight and was stolen
<START> this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen i say this without hyperbole and believe me i've seen a lot of bad movies it's embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars went into this film and that hundreds thousands of spent so much time working on what the writers and producers must have known would be a colossal failure br br when a 90 minute film feels this long drawn out boring and incomprehensible you know that something went wrong somewhere also jamie kennedy whose work i've enjoyed elsewhere is simply terrible in this role he was obviously never given a screen test because no producer in their right mind would consider him entertaining in any way especially in the guise of the mask simply awful br br personally i can't wait to see the reviews by the major film critics because i know they're do a better job than me at tearing this train wreck to shreds br br the producers of this film should be embarrassed and more importantly never be allowed to make theatrical films again
<START> this is without doubt the worst film in the hamilton saga and the worst actor to do carl hamilton peter stormare just cant pull it off with his psychotic looks and no style at all he may be good to do killers and psychotic maniacs like in fargo or 8mm but in this type of roles he is just useless br br lena olin's presence did no use for this film she couldnt save it from being what it is an americanized copy of big budget action movies like goldeneye die hard 3 broken arrow etc this film has nothing swedish in it but the actors its clear that some upstart director with as model director has made this br br mark hamill's presence is only laughable 2 out of 10
<START> hey the grudge 2 what up man i have a friend i would like you to meet the grudge 2 meet johnny's worst of 2006 list johnny's worst of 2006 list meet the grudge 2 br br what's going on here i was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to the grudge rather than a remake if that's the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original this floater doesn't even feel like a movie it's just a 90 minute soundtrack of the weird chick making that annoying croaking sound br br a sound on which i'd recommend you not get me started it was kind of creepy the first time i heard it but i've heard it about 12 times since 2004 so it's pretty much run its course and it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it'd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie sigh br br folks you're not funny so just shut up i promise you every single time that a character was walking slowly through an empty room which is approximately 97 of the movie somebody in the audience would start it up yes i know that's a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters but you get the gist so then some dude in the audience would giggle and not to be outdone deliver his own rendition i was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random people br br i told you not to get me started br br there's absolutely nothing about the grudge 2 that i can recommend there's not a single original scare or idea in the entire film there's not one memorable acting performance are you a sarah michelle gellar fan enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue are you an amber tamblyn fan i hope you can deal with the fact that she's given nothing more to do than walk around looking like she's suffering from a pinched nerve can you believe the story if you can call it that is even worse than the br br at least the original was fairly creepy and boasted a few effective jump scenes i didn't jump once during this yeah i made the word up deal with it that's right not a single time the scares are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the gotcha moment arrives watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess you're always four or five scenes ahead br br there are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever one that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug huh i say huh the audience laughed i shook my head and sighed there was a lot of that during the movie laughing sighing head shaking falling asleep i did twice br br the movie even makes a 1 5th hearted attempt at a plot twist wow it's so bad that i don't think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie please it was as shocking as elton john coming out of the closet br br and of course the ending goes the whole non closure look we might have another sequel route as soon as the credits rolled the audience booed my sentiments exactly had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent and i would've gladly led the charge br br we learned from the grudge that there's a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage then a curse is left behind much like a ben affleck movie it's a stain that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred well in the grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie shows br br the gist br br if you're a total wimp and never saw the grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares but i strongly recommend saving your money otherwise there's a good chance you'll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge
<START> the 5 may be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence according to the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill not by chance it puts the concept of a state fully complied with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a murderer but the law might not imitate the nature it might correct it states piotr the counsel for the defense a real catalyst character the punishment is a form of vengeance aiming at returning evil for evil without preventing the crime but in the name of whom the law takes its revenge really in the name of the innocent ones the horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals desperate plights don't demand desperate remedies kieslowski says in his message teaching us how can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of god that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged there are three different moral attitudes here the innate sense of rebellion of the murderer aiming at rousing the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment the strong sense of chronic indifference of the victim inclined to laugh at other people's requirements the deserving behavior of the counsel for the defense always ready to fight against adversity in favor of human life the struggle for life is ruthlessly all of the time the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi everything in 5 conveys a dreadful sense of estrangement and isolation descriptions of a waste of violence and folly scenes of precarious conditions of work sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation aimless wanderings through environments the main character is compelled to struggle with an opponent stronger than himself a town completely wrapped in profound indifference apparently hostile deaf to all his mute calls for help while a faded photo of a little girl in a first communion dress goes on gnawing his soul he's irremediably directing his steps towards a disconnected route to damnation seen through the of the 18 mm wide angle camera lens aiming at distorting every details altering the reality making it fade out in remote and alien echoes kieslowski doesn't bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with honey tongued tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant differently from some hollywood stereotypes like i want to live by robert wise he doesn't slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to guilt and to the brutality of the crime not interested at all in psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial proceedings in other words in opinion a crime is always a crime according to the principle of par he puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most sinister light and we can't remain indifferent even if we don't agree with him screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same manner that terri eyes do
<START> the chipmunk adventure is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980's alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me since they were what really got me into rock and roll neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits alvin's really the star and has all the cool looks theodore is the lovable sensitive one then there's simon my personal favorite the smart one who is often a party i also like the a lot there's brittany who like alvin is one who is always trying to be so popular then there's eleanor who like theodore is sweet sensitive and loves food janette is the only who is not much like her counterpart she's very naive and really clumsy br br in the very first full length movie david seville is going on a business trip to europe and he's leaving the boys with miss miller while he's gone while playing an arcade game alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money he'd race brittany around the world for real unbeknownest to the kids a man named klaus and his sister claudia who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash overheard this conversation and said that they'd let them race around the world for 100 000 alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race br br this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs off to see the world made for an appropriate theme song for the movie then there is getting lucky one of my favorite songs in the movie my mother is most likely the song in the movie but it always makes me cry wooly bully is the only cover song used in the movie the rest were completely original then of course there's the boys and girls of rock and roll which in my opinion has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history br br i used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of it died i still watch the movie though this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time it'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you'd expect out of world travel definitely one of my childhood movies and one that i'd recommend to 80's fans and alvin the chipmunks fans
<START> critters 3 starts on the open road as clifford john calvin his teenage daughter annie aimee brooks his young son johnny the imdb list two actor's christian cousins identical twins perhaps are heading back home from a vacation suddenly the tyre on their van blows they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it while there annie johnny meet a kid named josh leonardo dicaprio yes that one who in turn all run into charlie mcfadden the films co producer don keith from the previous two critter films charlie tells them the story of the critters the town of bend but they don't believe him meanwhile back at the van a critter lays some eggs on it's underside out of sight from everyone once clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home a run down urban tenement block in los angeles somewhere complete with critter eggs along for the ride upon arrival the eggs hatch the critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of frank geoffrey blake the caretaker as the night draws on the few remaining residents a fat woman named rosalie diana bellamy a telephone repair woman marsha katherine cortez an elderly couple mr bill mrs menges frances bay must come together with clifford his kids to fight the critters josh also makes an appearance as his stepfather william dennis hunt owns the building but will the group be able to defeat the critters prevent themselves from becoming dinner br br directed kristine peterson i thought critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film but at least she can say she made a film staring leonardo dicaprio not many people can say that the budget for critters 3 probably wasn't exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout there are very few characters very few critters i think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for the script by david j is strictly by the numbers very predictable a group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with critters have no means of contacting the outside world for help that plot scenario sounds very familiar right well it's same as the previous critters 1986 critters 2 the main course 1988 many other horror films so it should critters 3 does nothing with the premise it never even tries to add anything to an already old tired well used storyline critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke critters 3 can mange being a critter eating some beans then farting very funny if your about 5 years old the characters are mostly standard horror film clichÃ©s quickly became annoying there is virtually no blood or gore in critters 3 at all just a few splashes of blood disappointingly critters 3 in fact seems to go out of it's way not to show any violence the special effects on the critters are ok but they still look like static simplistic hand puppets that have very little movement the acting isn't that good critters 3 happens to be a certain leonardo very first feature film to be fair to the kid he's alright i wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become why on earth does that charlie guy have to keep popping up in these critter films to give critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace isn't boring it's generally well made with nice enough production values it's a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes overall critters 3 is an ok time waster but don't expect anything deep or meaningful there's nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but i couldn't help feeling that i'd seen it all before an average time waster that isn't as good as either of the previous two critter films critters 3 ends with a 'to be continued ' as this was filmed back to back with critters 4 1991 which unsurprisingly went straight to video probably to save even more money critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on t v for free otherwise don't bother
<START> this show has shown it's true colors now that democrats are in power it never did lead the world in iq as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been programmed to think one way which is a scary thing br br comedy central moved this it's spin off back to an earlier time once the democrats took power for a reason because now when the democrats screw up which is just as often as republicans do stewart no longer takes pot shots at them that is why the ratings for both this the spin are dropping br br basically most of the humor now is either lame or lame sarah palin jokes which all the ratings dropping comedians are now telling the facts to back this up speak for themselves the jay leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled the ratings for letterman conan the shows that follow them are down br br so emperor stewart is not alone trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling democrats in power they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power the bush years proved that because the ratings for this show colbert letterman leno were higher there br br has done one thing proved these shows have to be willing to take chances rip the folks in power if they are to prosper right now the daily show stewart are sagging but maybe they can get lucky have palin elected as the first woman president in 2012 then the lame palin jokes will become ratings grabbers
