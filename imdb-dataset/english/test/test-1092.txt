<START> have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades if you have don't bother with this one as you've already seen most of the scenes already and i can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies br br the story i'm sure that true storytellers will never forgive me is childish and stupid stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead every character is based in a clichÃ© and well they're nothing but the clichÃ© and yes again all you need to be a hero is to be american br br at least in finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the dvd was made for maybe i should sell my player then br br 1 10
<START> i woke up and it was a beautiful day the sun was shining the birds were singing and i fancied getting a movie something new a horror movie perhaps like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of in a gold wrapper the front cover is great and the comment on the back is mesmerising 'it will scare the crop out of you' oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance br br one of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these 'actors' i think no i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these 'scarecrows' who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes i used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night but having seen this movie i nearly wet myself through laughing so much just at the sight br br i have seen scarier quite honestly not mine though i'm a dab hand at cooking and if anyone associates this movie with my let's just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row br br if anyone has any good corn crop not pop movies they can recommend feel free to inform me it's a great comedy if nothing else ok it is nothing else enjoy but a little advice before pressing the play button on your dvd player throw it out of the window
<START> br br this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly although fairly popular slapstick californian beach comedy called but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right it is certainly better than i and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing but except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes venus was underpinned by the legend of the re incarnation of the goddess and summer lovers had the viability of a menage a trois as its theme in my view both these films were much more successful than ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi slapstick comedy the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie but few other films have succeeded in the same way and ii unfortunately does not there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo comedy they are also grossly overlong so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3 br br there is little memorable in the acting but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction it is in these latter areas that the failure arises br br
<START> this movie has some of the worst acting i've ever seen dennis quaid's performance was high school caliber while it's difficult to portray an off the wall character like jerry lee lewis it can be done just ask jamie foxx although ray charles had more depth to his personality and musicianship than lewis ever dreamed of possessing the phillips brothers portrayal belonged in the dukes of hazzard and alec baldwin playing jimmy is a bit like donald duck performing shakespeare when robert duvall played a country preacher i bought it baldwin never made me believe a single word wynona ryder's part was the best and she was mediocre and can anyone figure out how she was 13 when lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later some checking on the internet reveals the essential facts presented by the film were true at least no more fouled up than most hollywood bio pics this film did badly at the box office and it should have
<START> this movie is probably one of 3 worst movies made in history i rented this by chance without reading reviews and wow do i regret it really has no plot doesn't really follow the vampire genre just plain god awful watching this movie will taint your enthusiasm for vampire movies i felt like the writer director producer went on this drug binge and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film whole time i wanted the movie to end but the ending was even more whacked br br if this review can save just one person from watching this crap i felt my time spent on registration and writing this review was well worth it
<START> i've loved this movie for a long time i hadn't seen it in a while so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young so naturally i adored 'the chipmunk adventure ' br br i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie it's not wildly creative but i've always wanted to travel all over the world and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry br br 'the chipmunk adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever i'm sure i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time unless of course they have a young heart
<START> this was an appallingly bad film ashley rose orr was horrible she had none of shirley temple's charm at all those ghastly smiles she would do when she up her piggy little eyes in a way that i think was 'supposed' to be cute and make the audience go bless it just made me want to slap her she must have oh my about a hundred times throughout the film also she could barely utter a sentence without accompanying it with a fake giggle horrible horrible film if i could rate it minus 10 i would don't waste your money on this piece of rubbish go out and buy a genuine shirley temple film
<START> i watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death so i fast forward all the way through the end this movie must be the worst of all in the low budget sci fi movies category so far bad acting cast directions lara craft custom imitation story plot everything through out the entire movie i think that there maybe only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast but only two of them started in the entire movie i was expecting something like the starship trooper but it was nothing close to it i was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the dvd cover don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie come to think of it i wonder why did they even bother to put out bad movies like this one
<START> who's responsible for these behind the scenes things who are these actors did they crawl out from beneath rocks lots of yuks ' no no yuks for me only loathing and shame that i am a human being i have to avert my eyes from the set it's so embarrassing in fact i changed the channel br br i've always had a problem with robin williams' non stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings but at least he's funny once in a blue moon watching someone who isn't funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically without novocaine for all eternity br br please stop making these absolutely horrifying tv movies please
<START> what more can i add this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen terrible acting a daft script tediously slow pace even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen i could go on but i really can't be bothered i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me br br i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british film making br br and worst still i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it the only reason the dvd hasn't now been as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collection br br definitely one to be avoided
<START> bog creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash some knowledge of movie making a mixed bag of aspiring actors and a lot of determination yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking after school special in a bad way not a nostalgic good way i mean this is so so quality home movie student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free thankfully i found it in a discount bin somewhere sure there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing but it is a market that seems to only exist by default because there are so many poor b movies out there even more so now in this day and age br br the only people i would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers first i would recommend that they watch the special feature making of thing included on the disc see the film crews enthusiasm their hard work joy and very high opinions of their own product then watch the movie within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong bored i went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried but just don't know enough about what they are doing they knew enough to have fun but in the long run without necessary skills this interprets to they knew enough to be dangerous this is like a bad nickelodeon movie as apposed to a more decent one i guess a couple of the actors did ok and the cool stoner looking dude with the tattoo real or fake tattoo i know not was probably the best and most natural and i hope he makes it but their natural acting talent was what was coming through despite the bad movie bad script and so so directing principles if the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters studying successfully proven camera techniques and lighting principles to direct his crew better and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in a week or so according to the very indulgent documentary then maybe this could have been more of a film instead it's a film that has a feeling of some potential and has a few moments in it due more to the genre than the film itself but ends up showing nearly every frame what not to do if you want to see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like watch phantasm or even laserblast if you want a glorified home movie no joke get bog creatures
<START> i am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet in fact i just checked and there are 45 more minutes to go but no matter there's no need to see it through to the end i'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don't care to ever see or know br br what accounts for my hostility to this movie the characters are not believable the plot is not believable the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening basically every element of the movie rings false buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life however buscemi was badly mistaken because this movie contains nothing new it tries very hard to be depressing but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it because it's obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world br br what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards disgusting bottom line stay away from this worthless film at all costs
<START> even people who dislike the film usually because they find the ending confused should appreciate the strong acting of elijah wood joseph who played the two young leads in this movie br br spoiler warning at a literal level the ending makes no sense people who think the ending makes some sense at other levels are divided between those who 1 think the younger brother was killed by the step father either the one time mike the older boy was away dealing with the neighborhood gang or flew off the wishing spot in his wagon to escape the situation through death those 2 who think the younger brother is imaginary his flying off in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals his overcoming the abusive situation br br i favor 2 it makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations it is not uncommon for an abused child to split his or her psyche project the abused self into something else a stuffed animal even an imaginary friend this way it makes a lot more sense that it is always the younger boy who is abused never mike in reality it is unlikely for one of two brothers to get all the abuse although that does happen also it is bobby the younger brother who is also the encouraging one the one who insists that they can overcome the situation also the death of a real life sibling through abuse would have been too shattering for an adult with this in his history to transform into as upbeat a fantasy ending as this
<START> being quite a fan of charlie chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'the gold and then 'city i was eager to see 'the great as i had been told this was arguably his best film i was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie my first one chaplin wise br br the start is typical chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking it's funny well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes it was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic opening and at the same time kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another what was also well done was the way in which hitler is spoofed any scene involving hitler or in this film was funny and even now makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind the way in which english in mixed in with the mock german during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era my favourite joke was the five minute speech gave only for the english translator to translate it into a mere few words making you think back to footage of hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and indeed laugh at him br br historically the film got a few things right as well is seen getting his photograph taken with children something hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here is seen to yawn and act bored stabbing at hitler's underhand technique of winning over the german public through sympathy oh he hugs and kisses children he must be ok the film is also given a fantastic premise of a jewish civilian into the ghetto amongst all the going on but with the catch that he is oblivious films such as 'the and 'come and see' are two good examples of nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and and still pulls it off br br what i didn't like about the film however was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening this slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat the film started to hint at stories and sub stories these included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of palace whereas none of these were actually developed the a woman a and the has the coin in their pudding does the gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end just into nothing but excuses for drawn out unfunny gags which was disappointing br br during the final straight the great dictator gets a boost from the fact the italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film it works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when attempts to his italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks although they are humorously foiled despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact i felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat the great dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there
<START> this was one of those films i would always come across be it on tv or cheap dvd but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i wasn't missing out on much it was on one night and i thought oh wellÂ why not a good decision too as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it for me it left me impressed as it's up there with burt reynold's best features 'deliverance' 'white and 'boogie nights' and streams back to those 70s 80s gritty hardboiled urban crime thrillers that weren't afraid to be obscure and go out of their way to set up characters pack it with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate the local locations atlanta being the case here to the fold with grounded photography in certain shades it kind of reminded me of 'dirty harry' but that's loosely however it's honed blues score with its simmering kicks funky shifts and unhinged sounds very much had me thinking of lalo schifrin's pulsating score he orchestrated for 'dirty harry' the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss br br sgt tom sharky was an atlantic narcotic agent before a slip out during a bust saw him to vice work along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring which catches their interest due to fact it's owned by one hard to track and to convict crime lord what they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call girl which can give them some important names but they must get to her before she's made a target br br burt reynold's acts but also directs in an firm and muscular fashion which would suit his laconically hard nosed performance and gerald di thematically hard bitten and taut screenplay that was adapted from william diehl's novel well he does show some sort of heart insightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the fetchingly able british actress rachel ward be it the stake out scenes when he's watching her from another building and slowly becoming infatuated by her to when they finally come together but these latter interactions mid way through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like strokes the performances are fairly spot on with reynold's a great rapport with exceptional actors charles durning earl holliman brian keith richard libertini and bernie casey the scathing profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast as for the corrupt villains vittorio gassman builds imposing strength and power but it's henry silva who seems born for these roles cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place plus his adrenaline filled and violent cat and mouse climax with sharky and his team is brilliantly done br br the exciting action passages might be quick and dry but remain lethally violent like an immensely teeth grinding interrogation sequence some handy old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense the intriguing material keeps it quite tactical being character derived but when we think its smooth sailing it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely brunt confrontations
