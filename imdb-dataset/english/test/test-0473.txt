<START> i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series yet memory of it hasn't faded a bit this would be a natural for dvd re issue it seems to me many of the performers have gone on to greater fame robert hardy sean connery to name a couple though it was a role i still remember judy dench then in her 20's as katherine of france henry v she was very lovely then as now br br there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color is this so who of us would know virtually no color tv in those days mores the pity no vcr's if so some might have recorded it as a way of teaching english history this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage br br what a fine re issue this would be
<START> coming on the heels of that 1970's blackploitation era 20th century fox 1974 offered audiences a low key sincere and everyday people sort of a drama offering a far different fair to its audience which was far more general than those flicks being a down to earth dose of realism that offered a lonely counterbalance to those shoot 'em ups' br br replacing lead characters that were bad ass detectives super flies and megs pimps take your pick in terminology was a lone humble and meek teacher the we speak of is the main character pat conroy who is the one and only lone teacher hired to take on the responsibility of a sort of old time one room school house on an island off the coast of south carolina br br jon voight the name that the youngsters dub him finds conditions in the school terribly backward in addition to the physical properties of this little red schoolhouse any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent br br oh yeah by the way did we mention that further complications to any successful educational venture were manifested in two incontrovertible facts those were that pat conroy was both an outsider and he was white with almost the entire population of this off shore cay was black and very poor br br perpetuating these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local board of education being the school's principal mrs scott madge sinclair and the superintendent mr mr hume cronyn between the two we are made to understand that the teacher being the low man on the totem pole is powerless in most respects to affect any sort of meaningful long lasting improvements br br but don't you tell a 'young such as pat conroy that he can't can't anything that is spends a year of unorthodox classroom performances and is making real progress but alas the strong headed teacher won't give in and recognize the authority of his superiors while he is by law and unbeknownst to him serving at thee pleasure he disobeys mr specific order and prohibition to take his class kids to the mainland of south carolina on halloween for some trick or treating even going to the brazen act of stopping with them at the residence br br next we see a western union telegram messenger happily singing as he crosses from the carolina mainland to the island where he delivers the telegram to conroy that bore the news of his dismissal from his position with that school and district br br not being one to take his being fired lying down pat files suit against mr principal mrs scott and the board of education protesting his dismissal as being unlawful impartially reviewing both the offense and the law the judge asks if there are any lesser punishments that could be substituted for conroy's being separated from the school system to which he receives a negative response fittingly the judge dismisses the suit with his pounding down while saying it's very simple br br the story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion as the see him off to the mainland bound launch while a phonograph record provides us with beethoven's 5th symphony which had played an important part in the conroy educational agenda as well as our story br br in the humble opinion of this writer the story which we believe was at least semi autobiographical even giving the main character the name of its author was much more than a tale of a localized happening to both me pal schultz and meself this is a sort of depiction of a microcosm that represents the overall deplorable conditions that permeate the government schools throughout the entire nation just an opinion br br as for this film it was just one of many movies portraying the stores of common folk leading their lives of quiet desperation in the great hinterlands of the country which lie outside the d c beltway and the urban centers of enterprise and communications situated on either the atlantic or pacific coasts br br in its own small way this is a fine film which would soon be joined in the film vaults of 20th century fox by such great works as norma rae and breaking away both being from in 1979 br br see it if you ain't yet recommended by both and his buddy br br note why that's me of course br br poodle schnitz
<START> this is a little slow moving for a horror movie but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on imdb the camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good and the acting Â although variable Â is better than is often found in indie genre flicks br br as the lead robert field is rather stiff which is especially unfortunate given that his character claude is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action however it was the entry of christopher brandon that i considered the turning point of this film Â and not in a good way a twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion and slow moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy br br on the up side pete barker is consistently entertaining as father william he's the easy stand out in what is a fairly ordinary offering while the first half hour caught my interest i ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out
<START> what uh br br this movie is so dissociative and messed up that i literally lost a bit of my sanity after it was over i will never be the same person again i'm trying to put my finger on what exactly is so completely insane about it it's not just the hilarious techno music or the outside of time medieval blade runner wild west highlander setting or the weird cgi grendel monster that looks like a man made out of animated sausages or even the grendel's mother monster which looks like some alabama table dancer who grew claws and tentacles when she stayed in the tanning bed too long all of those things are weird but what's really the strangest thing in this movie is the acting i simply can't explain this script is obviously hellishly silly but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all lambert is always weird and usually kind of boring but for this one he's gone into dolph territory i can't help but just start laughing every time he talks br br i will give this movie some credit for being completely scatter brained and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring i'll always take a bizarre disaster of a film over an utterly mediocre one br br warning if you are planning on watching christopher lambert as beowulf be prepared to spend several hours thereafter wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish hyperactive catatonic daze it's true when i was done with my beowulf spirit journey i woke up in the middle of the siberian tundra in a puddle of blood and milk there was a dead wolf lying next to me and i later found i had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket my vhs copy of beowulf was sitting on a hastily constructed stone altar nearby enshrined with candles and wilted flowers the tape told me to walk i rose and i walked
<START> being too young to have experienced the hammer films when they were fresh and new i am discovering their hallowed horror films as i find them on dvd i know it was almost a decade and half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original hammer dracula in this late entry to the christopher lee series the original hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a terrific story to get involved in lee was a great dracula a vibrant vampire if that possible in the early outing but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that mostly stands around and looks threatening the young people talk like cartoon characters even though my aunt lived in england during the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those awful clichÃ©s i had no interest whatsoever in who lived or died amongst the younger crowd they were all pretty terrible characters anyway i did enjoy seeing a young and charismatic caroline munro but she leaves the story too early lee and his historic nemesis peter cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can't draw blood from this empty film it's d o a
<START> i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen and to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again i doubt it they always say don't judge something by its cover they were right when i saw the cover to skins gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars don't watch this film i can't think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad
<START> a deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle aged schlub danny devito who wants to bump off his mother and hatches a plan to do so with a bitter divorcÃ©e who wants to bump off his ex wife the movie is completely unapologetic in its cynicism and gives us no one to like but for once that works in the movie's favor rather than as a turn off br br anne ramsey as devito's battle axe mom steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance even though she's a horror you end up rooting for her because it seems like she could kick both devito's and crystal's asses at the same time with both hands tied behind her back br br grade b
<START> i've been a fan of since the beginning of on the food network so i have seen her grow over the years the minute i saw her interact with oprah i predicted that this show would happen because i saw how taken oprah is with her and with good reason she comes across as very natural and willing to laugh at herself which is very engaging the set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas i love the lazy susan that the audience sits on there's just enough of a celebrity segment and she stays away from controversy and debate there's enough of that on daytime tv the show is a lighthearted escape and she hasn't moved away from her strength cooking which is very good planning i know there are people who hate her and hate her show that's ok you can't please everybody and somehow i think rachael knows and accepts that so just turn the channel i don't think she'd mind
<START> this may actually the finest film of 1999 no i'm not kidding this documentary directed by chris smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject br br as the viewer watches mark and his efforts no matter how aggressive they may prove to finish his films he refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result but lest we forget remember speilberg scorsese and others started just as humbly br br and what a great subject he chooses mark his family and friends are all fascinating characters far more than any character created in last year's fictitious cinematic products this film on the dime between comedy tragedy touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create despite talent issues to get off their butts and make something br br the film is about maverick artists and their passions it is also about families no matter how co dependent and they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams but also to his family as well and they to him br br why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal that is assuming it was eligible last year this film is to be sought out and treasured
<START> i'm sort of between the gushy review and the hate review i've been a fan of lovecraft and a lovecraft for a long time and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities i went into viewing expecting the worst thing i've ever seen and wondering if lovecraft would turn in his grave over it but i was shocked to find that i actually kind of liked it br br i don't want to catalog the movie's faults so i'll only mention a few that keep this movie from being a amateur br br it's very low budget and shot on a video cam so it has the look of some soap operas but once you get used to the idea then it ceases to be a big deal the direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy still this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to lovecraftian intent than nearly all the stuart gordan and brian yuzna my main exception to those films being re animator and dagon put together the idea of being impregnated by some old one is reminiscent of dunwich horror and shadow over which isn't to say this movie is as good as those stories so the overall plot is quite faithful to lovecraft's ideas one thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid i'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that 'god's' words upset the old ones or just this particular zombie there was no real answer to that the rest of the christian symbolism in it reminds me of august take on the mythos so in a way this was a style take on the mythos br br i would recommend this film only as a curiosity it shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget i liked the setting of the wine the outdoor shots were sad though using the same stretch of beach and trees and nearly the same damn shot to convey 3 characters' long journey was really sad the director needs whack upside the head for that the acting was standard for an amateur film with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for best impersonation of gollum by an italian actress actually i think this film was done prior to the lord of the rings movies maybe andy sedaris watched her and thought dang she'd make a great gollum br br one little to the director though the makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids i was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching i was like oh so that's how we know she's evil and possessed but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman both living so it wasn't an attempt to say makeup zombie' but rather makeup was left on after however possessed zombie does equal 'blue contact heh br br on the whole i still liked this movie better than the yuzna and gordan films barring the aforementioned exceptions yuzna and gordan had much better budgets but this film did a better job at filming a lovecraft like story than they did and on a tiny budget br br one quick word to the the make up artist i know you wanted or something on fingers but long black press on nails looked really silly br br a quick word to the writer of the score i know you couldn't resist and apparently neither could the director who it but when the two characters square off with guns for a playing that little whistle from the good the bad and the ugly killed any mood that scene had accumulated it was cute but cute wasn't appropriate br br the filmmakers of this movie have read lovecraft and had a great deal of respect for him i enjoyed the little nods here and there the character carter with the bad dreams and the character pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie
<START> how is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors were they forced into it the plot has nothing to do with an idea of how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president they don't even try to give an impression of that just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals on dc politics the first five minutes the movie runs off the road and into b film drama about 1 a computer voting error 2 the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history and 3 a neurotic but extremely pretty female programmer who tries to tell the coming president about this she's soon the victim of the evil x files master lords of the computer company who instead of killing her drug her to make her seem untrustworthy but when she gets to dc she doesn't tell him in fact the movie then changes from b film drama to idiotic b film love drama up to now we are so far off the original starting point of the movie that most people turn it off i almost did if it just could've been intelligent love drama but no it's not it's the kind of oops i'm so nervous i'm being stupid all the time so please love me for it kind of love drama all with a slow slow pace that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie the x files plot of the movie or the comedy plot of the movie all plots fail on all levels which every annoying bit of meaningless dialog reminds you of the love part has to be the result of deciding during a drinking binge hey there has to be a dynamic of love between the president candidate and the extremely pretty female programmer yeah that'll work stick it in there br br meanwhile lewis black is castrated and put into a role where he doesn't come up with one single lewis black line the lewis black anger is replaced by a hope for it to surface sometime in the film which it never does and christopher walken is thrown into a hospital with heart trouble to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the president's closest aid in watching christopher walken being castrated like lewis black in roles that constantly struggles uphill to sound casual and ish but fail like titanic every time is like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach heartbreaking br br and then enter the low point of the whole movie it raises the mindbogglingly enormously difficult ethical question should robin williams go on to be president knowing that he got elected because of a computer glitch the american dream and all good prevails as he turns down the presidency on live tv like lassie the dog would with the usual patriotic glamor of the presidency and the we're so smart that we're making history atmosphere that cultivated in sickening abundance for the next million years br br the director and screen writer barry levinson is now on my personal list of writers and directors i'm staying away from forever this film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process where people barry levinson got to spend production money due to their personal relationships and not their skills this is a project made to satisfy poorly skilled people's wish for career success and the formerly mentioned great actors were tricked into participating in it that's the only explanation there can be br br ps the voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in dobbs and mills of course it was what else could it be when you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dish washing machine
<START> this is the kind of movie which is loved by 50 year old and people who consider themselves aware in social issues but really havenÂ´t got a clue the actors i think all of them are amateurs do their best but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they canÂ´t save it br br worst of all though is the cabaret that the kids are working on brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school the lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast translation 2 30 in the morning iÂ´m the dwarf of society an emotionally crippled individual br br please
<START> this movie was so horrible i want to beat the hell out of who ever made this movie i was a original fan of all the ghoulies movies but when i seen this i just began to cry i could not handle it there are not even ne ghoulies in it like the original creative monsters this is so friggen cheap i come on a witch thats bull crap no one wants to see the witch they wanted to see what the movie is about ghoulies i am i right or what thats y we watched the other ones now we have to actually put up with this horrible storyline this makes me want to eat my own poop after spaghetti monday
<START> the worst thing i have ever watch br br the movie is pure trash all the things is bad on this movie the direction screenplay arts cinematography cast or anything else br br may i say more br br the main character is an boy it has to have 20 years of age approximately but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old in addition he is an very bad actor br br the editing tries to save it but with that very bad material in hands they can't do miracles br br as i said the cast is poor the text is poor that it doesn't help the actors br br i learned how to do not make a movie
<START> there are films that make careers for george romero it was night of the living dead for kevin smith clerks for robert rodriguez el mariachi add to that list absolutely amazing ding a ling less flawless film making and as assured and as professional as any of the aforementioned movies i haven't laughed this hard since i saw the full monty and even then i don't think i laughed quite this hard so to speak talent is considerable ding a ling less is so chock full of double entendres that one would have to sit down with a copy of this script and do a line by line examination of it to fully appreciate the uh breadth and width of it every shot is beautifully composed a clear sign of a sure handed director and the performances all around are solid there's none of the over the top scenery chewing one might've expected from a film like this ding a ling less is a film whose time has come
