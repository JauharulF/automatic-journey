<START> i see there are great reviews of this film already i've got a few points to comment on reasons i thought there was something special about this film br br first and foremost the film is realistic it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager but that's really the kind of that goes on amongst teens all the time second the good guy the guy who treats women with respect doesn't get the girls that's the way it is in real life just the same he's too nice for his own good people are just selfish third it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self confidence i mean that role already takes confidence from the actor i'm not just talking about the character overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky teen sex comedies at the rental shelf don't get me wrong it's not all sad it's a good laugh as well
<START> mcgee is an out of control hard nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas the twist here is that is literally a walking buttocks br br the cheap low brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire that is not to say that is devoid of fart jokes just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs not groans and eye rolls the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever subtle humor used throughout the sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme in one photo a police cruiser is shown and the camera zooms in on the front license plate holder which is vacant the meaningless zoom in satirizes the production of the typical 70s 80s cop drama and incidentally makes me laugh every time br br all the typical characters are included the frustrated police chief who can't control the loyal minority partner who acts as a foil to recklessness the regular cops who detest means all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama br br the voice acting primarily performed by larry murphy is nothing less than spectacular voice breathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken slur is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all time greats like griffin family guy and homer simpson simpsons though the voice is slurred the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand br br besides the fantastic production and voice acting the script is also hilarious no nonsense directness fuels most of the humor particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force br br if you have access to the adult swim comedies mcgee is certainly worth the watching each episode clocks in at a mere 8 9 minutes so you really have little to lose
<START> when i saw the trailers for this movie it looked like a good romantic comedy i expected some light fluffy fun instead i was bored and a little depressed br br honestly there was no chemistry between the leads at all and the movie had little if anything that was funny about it the little girl was adorable when she cried i cried but i thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role br br either way the movie was filled with long dull silences or swelling opera music i'm not anti opera but i would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters who were all stiff and underdeveloped br br i was really disappointed in this movie the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been
<START> dodgy plot dodgy script dodgy almost everything in fact the most compelling performance is that of joanna pacula as lauren but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film the director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement br br presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others don't go out of your way to see it
<START> i saw this film while i was in france and i must say that it confused me it is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in morocco at the same time run into one another and form a connection simple enough well the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology the film is not played entirely in order and in reality did what i just saw really happen or was it only a dream given those parameters as well as the film being bilingual it was really hard to follow and i was not sure as to what happened at the end i imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than i could and it may require more than one viewing to understand
<START> when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv i only new of pauly shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day i still decided to watch it and i was impressed shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen in this movie he plays crawl a college adviser that probably needs his own adviser as well carla in an underrated role plays a midwestern farm girl with a simple family and a movie clichÃ© boyfriend travis when she heads off to ucla she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a bubbly blonde californian girl she decides to bring crawl home for the thanksgiving break when travis decides to propose needs a distraction crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and are engaged already this leads to crawl spicing up the romance between parents befriending her brother and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose i'm not going to reveal the end but i liked it anyway don't rent it if you want a poignant performance rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often missed part of 90's humor
<START> simply put there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out first the part where he was set to wash the toilet but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower i laughed so hard br br second the part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor he seemed like a pro diving in but as expected he couldn't swim proper at least however the funny part of this was when he finally reached the end and said how was that or something that was so friggin hilarious i couldn't stop laughing br br if you get the chance to see this anime series i strongly recommend it one of the best i've seen br br definitely the funniest
<START> perfect double bill for the horribly corny beverly hillbillies is this equally atrocious lame brained 'comedy' son in law country girl rebecca goes to wild california to attend college only to be assaulted by the lifestyle crawl helps her settle in and soon the two are good friends decides to bring the wacky crawl home for thanksgiving with obvious fish out of water results br br the only other comic angle steve rash aptly named achieves here is a sexual one this he bludgeons us with but to no avail both comic aspects fail dismally and you know the film is groping when crawl hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field br br dramatically the movie falls short too with several attempts at family and personal counselling from crawl misfiring between them pauly shore and carla manage to raise a couple of smiles but little else while the rest of the cast are mere fodder the problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like crawl and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why rebecca would want to spend a moment with him however if you're a fan of unintelligent comedy son in law is right on the mark br br sunday november 10 1996 t v
<START> this sitcom was a big crowd in the year 1984 1985 that was a time people could see deserted streets in most of the over crowded indian cities whenever there were sitcom on indian television screens all this was the result of the setting up of television relay stations across the entire indian nation this was one of the essential elements of the modernization of indian television network strategy adopted by the late indian prime minister indira gandhi it was also continued by her son rajiv gandhi this series provided clean entertainment which a large majority of indian television audience watched on their black and white television sets a funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company dealing in ayurvedic products a couple of days ago i caught sight of some episodes of this series but the overall laughter equation was missing this goes on to prove that may be with the ever changing passage of time entertainment material lose their charm and hold over people's minds
<START> swift's writing really has more in common with kafka and orwell than with fantasy adventure writers so it's curious that gulliver's travels has been deemed a children's novel lucky kiddies br br the same applies to this movie there have been some really awful versions of this story which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version i mean it's a tv movie and it comes from jim henson so how should we expect anything but cuteness br br look again beauty turns up in the oddest places children love this movie enough to sit through all three hours of it but it also takes the time to get swift's dark vision right i hate special effects but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of just dazzling us please note that the producers took the trouble to recruit classical actors like john gielgud and peter o'toole who perform their eccentric roles with perfection br br dramatically the romance between gulliver and is rendered touching and poignant as well as funny she's a little girl but twenty times his size the frame story has a theme about absent fathers that many children will relate to and the part about gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror dealing with the abuse of authority apparently deriving from val lewton's bedlam 1946 another forgotten masterpiece br br the vhs is always turning up in the bargain bin for a few cents which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing together i encourage audiences to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to watch it although it has a lot to offer children grown ups will find that it stands up nicely to such classics as aguirre brazil 1984 and other serious fantastic works
<START> the script is very weak there is no depth in the characters the story telling is not the importing thing here the unnecessary action scenes does not really help this one one of the worst movies in history of films
<START> it is unfortunate that between this film in the valley of lions for lambs and home of the brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in iraq and afghanistan the boozing the fighting the short fuses the broken marriages guys freaking out and digging a foxhole in their front yard when they're drunk etc etc etc br br does it happen yes but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies i think that it is unfortunate that these directors producers writers choose to grind their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way in this particular film kimberly didn't even throw us a bone like showing the new children that were born while a family member was deployed or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the gi bill or the couple who can afford a house or start a new business earn their citizenship etc etc etc instead we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this film only want to show you the bad side br br a couple of issues with the film itself 1 somebody screwed up by putting phillippe in for a bronze star with v after he led his squad down a tight alleyway after having been baited by a gunman in a taxi pretty stupid but yes it happens 2 the didn't have any turret armor so we are supposed to believe it is a near the beginning of the war yet every soldier and their brother has an and every possible attachment for their m4 sorry don't think so 3 timothy olyphant as a lieutenant colonel it's hard to believe but i just checked an he turned 40 in may so the timing isn't too off 4 he strikes two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying that he wouldn't return to iraq upon having learned that he had been stop so he's a fugitive then when he finally turns himself in at the end and they take him back he keeps his rank and deploys with the same unit sorry don't think so br br i can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the army and the infantry do some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers yes however in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes and really things just aren't like that for most soldiers returning i wish the director had made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting off with her agenda and then making a film br br of the movies i mentioned at the beginning of this post the best one is probably lions for lambs which is more a commentary on the sad state of generation y than it is about the wars in iraq or afghanistan or the bush administration if you really want to see this film wait for cable or netflix it don't pay cash directly to rent it
<START> james stewart plays dr ben mckenna who with his wife and son are tourists in an arabian city they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene the victim whispers something in dr mckenna's ear and he is told to do something br br later his son is kidnapped the kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew but the woman is a bit softer than the man br br the song que sera sera whatever we'll be we'll be is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie br br doris day play's stewart's wife and she sings the song mentioned above her performance is oscar worthy i'm surprised she wasn't even nominated br br my score 8 10
<START> a bare faced rip off of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes the word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this lambert is wooden as always his moments of 'emotion' are laughable as is his accent the is not that at all as we've had so many signals and by the end we're simply immune to flesh rotting and otherwise altogether a real mess
<START> i can not believe i even wasted a netflix rental on this complete piece of crap how long did it take to make this film 15 minutes on a budget of what fifteen bucks i can spend a few hours with my sony camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous lump of bile and it's even available on dvd a very sad thing to think classics like the stepfather have not been released on dvd but this chunk of steaming dung makes it to the format here's hoping my rating of one one one one makes the overall already pathetic rating of 2 5 go down
