<START> one of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end there was just something about the movie that made me zone out i think because i keep looking back and thinking yep still in that tree still looking at the water poor character development i felt nothing when they were in danger i was voting for the croc i found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat i find that really unlikely as well the croc seems too supernatural at times 'all knowing all also when the croc attacks it's behavior seems very unrealistic it's a killing machine and wouldn't be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row especially when attacking in the water
<START> i saw anatomy years ago dubbed at a friends house i don't remember it much and then i saw at the video store there is a second one not really related to the first one franka makes a little cameo and that one was okay not as good as the first one i'm seeing the first one again tonight not dubbed collectors edition i really like german movies like this one it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think i dunno but it's very grossly entertaining and scary anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first but if you really thought anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one
<START> the main problems of are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just the main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor the film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and so why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters a tremendous unlikelihood can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room it has not sense at all except to be the final d effect of the movie the killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if it's lying like a dead body this can't be possible finally it doesn't work the right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow the male nurse but not the floor of the white room the director shouldn't have showed the killer's face and maybe the site where he is hidden then the film would be a quite good thriller however is just a fiasco hitchcock please come back
<START> christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money when i see his latest releases i can believe that br br beowulf is all in all in the good part of the crap movies there are some good thrill scenes indeed the actors themselves aren't too bad but the plot is silly the mortal kombat like music has nothing to do here the ending is really s y br br really the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was i even wish i wasted my money on something else br br
<START> van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes this movie was amazing the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america usa van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action acting and the film a five star look i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better keep them coming van damme br br watch this film if you enjoyed films like until death the hard corps and second in command
<START> easily lucio fulci's most respected film don't torture a duckling is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter gruesome imagery and strong storyline terror befalls a small italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery was it the creepy hermit the spastic voodoo witch one of the hookers the rich girl someone else contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content i consider it much more plot driven featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed involving chains and boards in no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers fulci proves himself fully capable of dishing out one hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with killing black magic and of course a nice full set o' knockers though i'm particularly more fond of fulci's lizard in a woman's skin and new york ripper don't torture a duckling dominates the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery
<START> 1 let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could might or ought know how it is or ought to be there in space human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages maps are compared to today's satellite maps so we really have no clue 2 considering this is just a bbc tv docu simulation it gets much better than many big budget hollywood blockbusters and that is just incredible 3 all in all a show worth watching as it portrays the cgi enhanced and fictionalized account of what we know of the solar system this far 4 probably fictionalizing and cgi ing the whole thing is the only way to make it palatable to a large public ever watched clips from real space missions and real space probes the quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x ray and what it tells about the human body and compare it with a cgi ed cyborg movie which one would be most entertaining yet the chest x ray is real while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized sfx 5 actors do a good job none i'll tell my grandchildren about but very fair for it being a bbc docu simulation
<START> comparisons to the original series are inevitable it's a shame diana rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers and macnee probably regretted this as much as any fan there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise linda was ok as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the rigg episodes only the rigg macnee chemistry was lacking the new avengers should have been left on the shelf a declining macnee an annoying and a who the hell is this guy gambit also the humor was forced and poor granted i only watched a few of the episodes because that was all i could watch but i think i got the idea try as many might and do it's nearly impossible to resurrect an old show as a new format or movie
<START> in order to enjoy an imaginary portrait of diane arbus ' stephen needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer diane arbus paradoxically it's the very use of diane name and knowledge to her life and work that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale br br what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful waspish and glamorous nicole kidman as the anti glamorous jewish diane arbus is that didn't get arbus or what her work was about unsentimental realism and seems only attracted to arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks br br what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as kidman's hairy fictional love interest however it's not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film but the director's misogynistic stance that diane arbus one of the art world's most singular and original woman photographers was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work while his previous film was a study of female masochism his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely and flys in the face of the real life diane courage tenacity and fearlessness in single handedly exploring the often shady world of outsiders br br imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star madonna's life with guy richie as her svengali the man behind her career and you'll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject or just choose to ignore all the facts br br it's a shame because once you remove all reference to diane arbus this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to secretary 4 10
<START> 1 hour and 40 minutes of talking boring talking and more talking and then some it is hard for me to grasp how an actress like anne who shone superbly in femme fatale would sign up for such a piece of crap unbelievable if you need a this movie might help although i would prefer some nice classical music unfortunately i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear that's almost as unbelievable so short and succinct one or two sentence commentaries expressing one's core take on a movie is not enough geez people i made my point and don't to waste your time with more unnecessary words as this movie does wolfgang
<START> there are so many episodes that make me howl over the stories br br that i wish i could pick the best ones and bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and bs their way out of hard time just to drag dan into their life of crime br br canadians will notice the odd joke for toronto or the federal government and because the cbc axed a really good show by the that dan was part of the show takes shots at them and in the episode dan's umbrella the cbc is raked across the coals br br when dan says that the cbc would never waste money on useless venture enters the room and gives dan back his tape of friday night with ralph this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the cbc's history for making shows people don't watch or good shows that they do watch
<START> when a killer calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by asylum so far it's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly have you checked the girl naturally she has the calls traced by the cops after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks hanging up when he calls waiting ten seconds and dialing 57 sound familiar yeah that's why i rented it too br br well it should and i hate to say it but this could've been more entertaining than the big screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake rather than revelling in b movie ripoff glory it tried to do something original it tried to make the lead character sympathetic rather than having clichÃ©d campy fun with her mind you this could've worked with a talented actress but she wasn't sure she looked good and she screamed and cried but oh well whatever br br then came the horrific ending not horrific in that it was horrifying horrific in that it was boring the pacing up until that point about an hour in was campy clichÃ©d and fun then it heads in another direction and it veers away from just another dumb fun slasher movie with a sexy teenage cast to a hostel esquire gore borefest br br i guess this falls into the oh well whatever category the lead actress flubbed a line oh well whatever i don't feel like it we forgot to give the killer motivation oh well whatever i don't feel like rewriting it the pacing completely changes halfway through oh well whatever i don't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off continuity errors oh well whatever br br if you like this kind of movie dumb cheesy predictable campy splatter movie with sexy cast then you'll be fine up until the ending the ending is stupid it's not fun it's not scary it's not campy or cheesy or quickly paced in fact there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the dvd and looking around at the stuff in the room then screaming and whatever
<START> you cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn't grow up in france or spent at least 10 years there like me i don't know if it will ever make it outside french cultural borders i include belgium and luxembourg here you cannot translate its kind of fun every name is joke how many people outside paris would understand the pun in the name of one of the roman legionnaires however monica bel l is so beautiful i almost forgot to breathe when i saw her
<START> first off i never got into dr who until recently honestly i never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations pun intended since it was never big here in the us as it is everywhere else br br that said i must say obviously that after finishing the 2nd season that this is one of the best sci fi shows i've ever seen br br now i watch a lot of sci fi shows from all over and this show stands out br br the first season was tops to begin with with christopher eccleston in the title role and i thought he was terrific of course so was the lovely billie piper who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of rose that no one could've done it better let's not forget as jackie and noel clarke as mickey ricky who are just a blast to watch then there's david at first i thought he was too gawky looking to play the character his ears but after watching the 2nd season he fits in just fine his sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless he's great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without batting an eye br br aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared a lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn fine br br the production and direction of the show is top notch occasionally there'll be some cheesy effects here and there but that's always been a factor in the original series and like those episodes is negligible br br my favorite thing of all about the series the stories writing folks is always the key to great entertainment russell t davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job they've managed to bring excitement ingenuity intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog i also appreciate the fact that they can breach the older past story lines and enemies well my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show and respectfully br br i won't mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the sci fi channel just started airing the 2nd season br br i wouldn't want to spoil it it's so much fun and excitement you'll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog br br it really is that good br br ps thanks to the producers for nicholas briggs back exterminate
<START> i'm sick of the open mind argument i'm generally quite open minded but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed you know what there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this and just because someone out there isn't doesn't make it less so there is after all a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust and no amount of open mind or pushing the envelope should eliminate that feeling otherwise we're no better than senseless living things br br back to the film another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men which may be why men don't like it but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn't make it great maybe men shouldn't be turned on by what's dominating the movie industry but is the answer for women to do the same maybe if you don't like movies tv and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women so much violence don't watch them br br and if you're a director don't make them br br otherwise some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real life br br heck some people seem to like it so much
