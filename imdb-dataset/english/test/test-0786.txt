<START> this is a fun movie with subtle intention its off beat comedy is hilarious to me unfunny to my friends the soundtrack is perfect br br i own this on vhs and i have watched it many many times because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals though using joan cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent i know i know she was still young br br on a sad note i decided to check out the dvd last night instead of watching my vhs tape and was shocked to find many crucial scenes cut and on the copy i watched there was no special feature of deleted scenes it was as if the deleted scenes never existed i am so glad i bought the used vhs at a flea market br br it is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this which is another reason i love it so much it takes great skill talent and genius to move around the scenes like mercedes ruehl dean stockwell and matthew modine do from scene to scene note the scene when the grocery carts converge the rolling on the floor during the shoot out in miami the chicken lickin' debacle the foot massage the salon hair washing there is a very theatrical feel to this film which may be the turn off for so many whose poor reviews follow i know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and over the top performances for poor acting and worse direction not so jonathan demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles br br the opening credits and first scene rank among my all time favorites as well another favorite opening credits first scene fly away home br br too bad matthew modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye i really like him and found his casting perfect in the role of mike smith actually this film is well cast from soup to nuts everyone is believable and true to his role as for the question of expecting audience to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians why not i thought they pulled it off perfectly well br br charming fun exciting what is there not to like if you want a little fun watch this quirky colorful adventure mob love story if you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families tune to hbo's the sopranos

<START> from the film's first shot keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn thus invoking all the clichÃ©s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself br br joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen's subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p p is not about passion sexual tension or love it's about different strategies of negotiating the of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety br br the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances br br it was so obviously trying to be a serious film the humour which is pride prejudice both austen's methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you can't lose jane austen's technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous cinematography br br elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine elizabeth's wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with what a lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austen's elizabeth at least in austen's eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining propriety knightley's elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew br br donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy br br just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache
<START> a group of teens have their car break down in the middle of nowhere they seek shelter in a farmhouse but three murderous convicts are there killing the owner of said farmhouse and his family one of them accidentally brings zombies around by knocking over a scarecrow cue blood gore carnage bad acting better than the first but only by default i still wouldn't wish it on my arch enemy bob in the end the filmmaker wants it to be a parable about how we us americans are killing and our forests huh ok whatever buddy dude i'd rather chop down forests then have my braincells diminish and my grey matter leak out of my ears in other words become a simple minded idiot liberal br br my grade d
<START> this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christie's work a lifeless muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace and the budget of its predecessors death on the nile evil under the sun and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go of course he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christie's plot alone all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest but the direction is hopelessly flat 1 2
<START> this is a truly awful movie the jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right endurance test the only thing funny to come out of this production is it's comparison to the classic film this is spinal tap br br avoid this film as if it were one of the plagues of the bible itself br br
<START> even in her glasses wearing geek mode kathy ireland is very easy on the eyes but her acting is not easy to watch most of the actors in the film either take it way over the top beyond campy fun or act slightly embarrassed at being there the effects and soundtrack are nothing special and fairly low budget the plot line really stretches ones ability to suspend disbelief catch this one to laugh at if it comes on a premium movie channel or network saturday afternoon tv but do not waist money on this thing br br one worthy mention for trivia purposes is that one of the underground mobsters is played by deep roy deep is now famous for playing and doing it well all the in burton's charlie and the chocolate factory
<START> if you're actually reading this review i give you a lot of credit you care enough to actually look up this movie which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review so for your reading pleasure br br i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time typing that out i will mention that sandra bullock did an amazing job with this movie she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer often difficult to do i can say this because i happen to be a computer programmer br br anyway i thought the basic plot was a very good one you can easily build sub plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie the premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right aren't taken br br to make a long review short oops too late if you enjoy sandra bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time take a look at this little gem you won't be disappointed
<START> hellraiser bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the hellraiser series well and truly sets in gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies gone is the ethos of pinhead and his minions gone are the sick desires of humans in fact everything that once made hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture br br all that is left is that basic premise of christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons what happened to the evil that men do this watered down excuse for a hellraiser movie is padded out with endless psycho babble so that pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be br br the film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed pinhead is not alien the link between the box and the 'demons' or is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a br br the lead female character is called and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name br br shame on you kevin and alan smithee
<START> unfortunately due to a sluggish start i can't say that this is one of hitch's best films it very excellent none the less the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back they both give excellent performances not surprising of course really however i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music the climax at the opera house was fantastic and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene also the use of doris day singing que sera sera was excellent especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film so this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look 8 out of 10
<START> the movie forever strong will never be nominated for an oscar it will never be nominated for best acting for best motion picture but this movie does have things that other movies don't in a nation with so much scandal so many problems movies being poured out with little thought to the morals of society at least this movie promotes good what is wrong with standing behind something that promotes happiness we should support movies that tell our american teens that there is more to life than sex drugs and alcohol as for this debate as previously stated the is not exclusive to the new zealand all blacks various utah high school football teams and colleges perform this ritual before games including hawaii byu etc
<START> goldeneye is a masterpiece the storyline is amazingly depicted the characters beautifully animated and the weapons are the storyline is so interesting even when you complete every single mission to get more levels you have to beat them on a higher difficulty and the multiplayer mode is so you pick the weapons you want to play with then play me and the three of my friends along with my brother always play goldeneye if you don't have this game i suggest you buy it
<START> i was attracted to this film by its offbeat low key 'real life' story line that is a twenty something guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother it just might have worked but there's a problem and that problem's name is casey affleck br br casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film his acting mantra must be exert as little effort as possible at all times or why speak when you can mutter or maybe put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls lips moving when speaking barely facial expressions none muscles in face something nothing anything zip
<START> when you want to celebrate life and love especially for precious little daughters you have to shout it from the countryside and what gorgeous there are so many tears of joy even god joins in see this movie br br
