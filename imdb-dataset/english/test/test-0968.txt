<START> i had the privilege to watch mar last friday and i am still shocked by its beauty the powerful work of every single actor and actress and amenabar's unbelievable ability to narrate the story of ramÃ³n who was well known in spain for asking for a legal euthanasia lost the court cause and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison freezing all our hearts with his determination not to go on living forever because of an accident br br before watching the movie i was already mesmerized by the strong in its title which i would translate as into the sea and not as some suggest out to sea and which is taken from an original poem written by the man this story is about then i watched the movie oh my friends this is cinema with a capital c the narration flows to take you to the heart of every single character reincarnated in a bardem that you forget from the very beginning is in the center as a man full of sense of humour and full of hope and his hope is to die because for him the life he is living is not worthy to be lived the rest of the characters but one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as a human independent being forgetting he depends on the others for everything even though they do love him so much and this is what the movie is about love you can feel it you can breathe it in the skin of every character you witness the growing of the feeling within three women who meet him in the movie the member of the association that defend his right to die with dignity his friend her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world rosa the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her julia the woman who shares a tragic destiny with ramÃ³n and eventually acts in a way we cannot but only understand br br however before meeting these women ramÃ³n knew what was love like because you cannot meet him without loving him and he is deeply loved by his family four characters unique in their humbleness and bravery each with their own thoughts about his decision each thought respectable in its own way because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is to blame for what happened that sadly life sometimes is that terrible from this familiar quartet i specially liked mabel rivera's work as sister in law a terrific performance br br i would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax points i have seen in a long time and if you haven't seen the movie don't read this pass over this paragraph and read again from the next one starting mar let the movie show its secrets to you the episodes i loved were 3 the best love scene i have seen in a movie when i really felt love invading the screen is when ramÃ³n dreams awake that he is flying to meet julia in the beach and they kiss each other 2 speaking by phone with ramÃ³n the day before he is going to do it and he tells her it is better they say goodbye at that very moment not to put her in trouble with the authorities and then she knows it is the last time they are going to talk and she has fought for his right to die but she does not want to lose him because she loves him as a true friend and even though she is respecting his decision at all cost 1 the best a young ramÃ³n in the beach looking at his girlfriend under the sun jumping to the water from the rocks to a sea that is retreating we see the crash we hear his voice recalling what happened and claiming he should have died that very moment the face of bardem face downward shown to us from the bottom and the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years there are many others like the impressive ending in spite of the fact that in spain we know too well what ramon did br br mar did not deceive me amenabar never does but this time he has to thank the actors that took part in the project and who maybe took it personally because this is not just a movie it is an to a man who died alone when he was asking to die legally which meant for him as bardem pointed out dying with the people he loved and who loved him around
<START> it is amazing what you can see if you wake at 2 am and turn on the telly i didn't know they showed films like this i immediately thought of roger corman who reused locations for movies or used other films locations for his own movies br br the makes of this film could just move the camera angles and add some time and they would have an xxx film br br there was no story just minimum dialog that led to stripping and sex i bet there wasn't 100 words in the whole film but there sure was a lot of very large busts and hot lesbian action there was male female action too but it was only about 25 of the movie br br another interesting thing came to mind in watching this film that may interest those who are buying hi def dvds sony refused to license betamax to adult film makers and adult films came out on vhs you can guess what happened to beta max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos sony has again refused to license blu ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a deal with you can guess which high def system will disappear
<START> cuba gooding jr is back on top jesus he did a great job in this film i loved this movie its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something anyway i would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat well worth the price of admission and as for cuba gooding jr just give him his next oscar right now
<START> some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not a college professor david suddenly gets a yen for adoption he pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named adam as it turns out adam doesn't have both in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for dr this sob story played out with one problem after another all centered around adam's and seizures why wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained along the way the good doctor managed to attract a to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out personally i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack bypass this yawner
<START> these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class the musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person get this dvd and you will enjoy it throughly i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in houston tx and was blown away i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicianship is there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime lets just hope and pray that they do not retire anytime soon
<START> this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected of course it's sappy of course it's predictable we all know the fairytale but knowing that when you go to watch it it's enjoyable enough to watch it was funny and sweet i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t shirts about math i was an outcast in high school and i didn't do these things it goes much deeper than that having to do with many things some of that being how much money your family has how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids anyway i won't get into it i don't agree with other opinions that drew isn't convincing as a geek with braces no make up and unwashed hair i don't think too many people would be drooling over her and even when she goes back to high school and sheds those things she's still wearing the wrong clothes wrong hair and has the wrong attitude to be considered cool and her other geek friend may be beautiful but it doesn't matter where i come from you can still be an outcast and be beautiful inside and out
<START> this movie is so bad they should burn the master you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one the graphics are less than fake they're horrendous then you've got the rambling through the countryside star work a holic who bounces between his own lunacy the mad rantings of the crazed preacher when he finally makes it to dc they don't even have the decency to kill him the monster which you don't know at the time is already dieing but how who knows of course it has the ultimate sappy ending everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family a handful of survive imagine that this will be the movie that c thomas howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in it probably gives him nightmares
<START> i'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film if you don't like this movie for what it is a silly over the top mob story then you are simply reading too much into it this film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape the life and the troubles that follow her michelle pfeiffer is terrificly 80's who is an uncertain uncomfortable mob wife while matthew modine is an anal retentive like mob tracking cop who falls for her the plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and mercedes steals the show as the queen of mob wives if you aren't looking for something too dynamic and complex this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's cult classic you won't be able to stop watching if you start
<START> okay so gus van sant wanted to remake psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black white while they conveniently forget that both clerks and schindler's list were filmed in black white and are great movies br br unfortunately the same narrow minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black white are the same people who wouldn't like psycho anyway because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes and the murders are not the grisly blood guts gore bone snapping that people are used to from having seen halloween friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street this is why remaking psycho almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work because it's really only of interest to people who are fans of the original everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next scream sequel comes out and for that reason they will be disappointed psycho relies on suspense and mystery not blood and guts and just so nobody thinks that i must be a senior citizen if i like older movies let me set the record straight by saying that i am 21 br br so if doing the movie in color was all that van sant wanted to change why not just colorize the movie and it i mean what's the point of remaking a movie if you're not going to change anything the least he could have done was to put his own director's spin on it rather than just copying hitchcock's or even better hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original psycho book but it seems that van sant couldn't decide whether he wanted to remake psycho exactly or not this should have been an all or nothing project either remake the movie exactly or do it differently but as it stands this movie is about 95 the same but with a few touches thrown in that don't seem to have any purpose such as having norman masturbate while he spies on marion undressing it doesn't serve the plot at all and the only reason he put it in was because he could he wanted to say hitch couldn't show people masturbating in 1960 so i'm going to do it whoopee big deal like i'm so shocked at seeing someone masturbate and what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes and then he leaves out an important scene where lila and sam meet the sheriff outside the church br br plus by using the almost exact same script the entire movie seems a bit of an anachronism the opening credits say that the year is 1998 then what's with marion's 60 ish looking dress or the parasol she carries with her why do marion and sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing why are there no air in marion's office why does the bates motel have no tv's in the rooms and apparently no automatic locks on the doors why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the bates motel this was why using the exact same script was a mistake just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it it needed a whole reworking br br while vince vaughn turned in a good performance as norman he just didn't seem right for the part part of what made the original psycho so creepy was that norman had that innocent boy next door quality so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes with vince vaughn playing the part is anyone really surprised that norman was a psychopathic killer br br that said i can understand that gus van sant was obviously a fan of the original psycho movie and wanted this to be a tribute this isn't a bad movie but the problem is that this may be some people's only exposure to psycho i really think you should see this movie only if you've seen the original since i am a fan of anything to do with psycho i bought a used copy of the remake which i may watch occasionally the original movie was a filet mignon whereas the remake is a hamburger but even filet mignon would get boring if you had it everyday so it's nice to have a hamburger once in a while for a change
<START> this movie was release when i was 15 and i could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed br br that was over 24 years ago and i haven't seen the movie since this time around i cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is br br life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact i think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls also it doesn't matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you girls boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise sometimes you just gotta let go and say next br br gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for karen this is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone br br i remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics the acting is not quite there compared with fast times at high but it kicks ass over this movie simply because has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending nice guys finish last gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive we all know a david fun guy who makes you laugh br br some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them especially at that age i have experienced that first hand br br great sound track too u2 i will follow jesus is it that old
<START> i bought the dvd out of a big bin for 4 99 thinking i'd lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the mountains and in particular fast forwarding through the film i reached the climactic scene in which the climbers catch their first sight of mount towering to all of 13 260 ft in canada's coastal range at least one of the several bozos geared up to climb clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldn't have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain given that one of the film's premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale while good enough for the likes of reinhold are beneath him to be honest i haven't watched the whole thing what i've seen makes me cringe they say that you get what you pay for at 4 99 i've been ripped off
<START> this is the award that made me lose all respects for the br br if such a distinguished panel can't see or care about the obvious story telling problems of battlestar galactica then what worth is their award the answer not much br br award winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence neither of which are in evidence in bg in this episode or any other that i've seen br br shooting in drab video is not artistic it's just cheap shaking the camera is not creative it's vomit inducing and lazy as can be br br all bg has shown is how corrupt most award giving academies really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of pr money
<START> as to be expected there's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always popular premise of zombies and starring the 80's b movie queen linda blair namely it sucks the chilling is trying enormously hard Â way too hard Â to be a story with depth and factual background whereas it should have just been a light headed and gore packed horror flick about frozen zombies it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens there's a lot of drivel about which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures so naturally in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen needless to say this is extremely boring until two dim witted night watchmen decide during an electric power failure that it's a good idea to put the metal constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm the are struck by lightening obviously and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage the chilling is a boring and surprisingly for a late 80's effort at least gore free horror film that doesn't even use up a quarter of its potential all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and i can't think of any reason why the zombie attacks had to be so bloodless even in spite of the low budget available they could have done better the set pieces make up effects and costumes are pitiable the research lab for example looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldn't look less menacing with their green faces and foil wrapped outfits how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery she's attracted to lousy b movies like bees are to honey
<START> that's how i'd sum it up there were other who said naked gun meets james bond i think mine is more accurate but i'm not neutral on that point o br br this movie is kind of a blast from the past it reminds you of the old movies from the '50s '60s and that's not only because it plays in that time period 1955 to be exact with the flashback exception but it's the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen the main actor here who is as i've been told very popular in his homeland france is perfect in his role here he's the spy with the number 117 attached to him there is one character who sums him up in the movie by asking a question about if he's good or not you'll see when you watch the movie br br very funny indeed this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair but not taking itself or anything else for that matter seriously than you need to watch this o
<START> normally movies stay out of the realm of domestic drama and for good reason who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life divorce hurts an incredible percentage of american families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it that's not escapism the number one reason the average person turns to movies that's sad reality br br normally divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters kramer vs kramer focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling that's a challenge for both this film and its audience turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face writer director robert benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by avery corman br br the story as one would expect is quite simple big business advertising man ted kramer dustin hoffman comes home to find his wife joanna meryl streep is leaving him and their 7 year old son billy justin henry ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does joanna brings a custody suit upon him br br to make an oscar winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue heavy first takes tremendous acting talent you don't get much better than hoffman and streep hoffman is in his prime in this role his first oscar win after three other notable nominations he creates a thorough character one whose self centered and quick tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care giver streep wins her first oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody streep does so effortlessly the young boy justin henry who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in academy awards history plays the embodiment of all 7 year old children exceptionally well br br writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family previous notable credits bonnie clyde and superman wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama but the man can flat out write numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict the first morning that joanna is gone and ted make's billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in americans' kitchens every morning br br you'll rarely see a story as straightforward as kramer vs kramer done better there aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen the film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure fire delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar
