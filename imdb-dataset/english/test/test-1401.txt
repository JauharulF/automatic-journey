<START> i have been getting into the hitchcock series very much lately i find myself always renting one of his movies when i'm at blockbuster or hollywood video like i said before hollywood is loosing it's touch incredibly i needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there not to mention i want to be a film appreciator not a movie buff is there any better way to do that than with alfred hitchcock's movies br br the man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring alfred's favorite leading man james stuart and the woman who steals the show day they play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son but when a spy tells james some information that could arrest another spy his son is kidnapped and held for ransom james seems to just doubt and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick br br the acting again i would say that was the one who outshined the whole cast james did a great job keeping up together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film i loved the little bit of comedy at the end that alfred added you'll see what i mean i would always highly recommend this film despite not being the best hitchcock film it's still a treasure br br 9 10
<START> the film begins with a dowdy housewife norma shearer finding out that her husband rod la rocque had been cheating on her three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity oddly during this time la rocque did not see shearer or his two kids as shearer took them to paris br br marie dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved norma to come to her house for the weekend ostensibly to help marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and la rocque apparently norma is now a super vamp and with her magical sex appeal she can break up the romance and no one seems to realize that she and la rocque were married several others are there for the weekend and immediately norma is a hit with her gay carefree sexy ways and almost all the men including la rocque are captivated by her neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex wants the new and improved norma back this film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper crust similar in some ways to jean renoir's the rules of the game oddly despite the severity of the depression such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots however fortunately in let us be gay there are plenty of cute and funny moments particularly towards the end when marie dressler shows her true colors while not a great film it certainly is a good one and more than just another time passer my only real regret is that i didn't love the very end you'll just have to see it for yourself perhaps you'll agree about the ending perhaps you won't but i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film
<START> well i'll begin with this i love horror movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homage br br however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of c movie crap from 7 and up i know you're joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you can't be for real br br everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so i'll leave it br br minor spoiler alert br br but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me
<START> wonderful family film that should be a staple at christmas time it's a mystery to me why it isn't a true lost film that i first encountered flickering away on my old 19 black and white rca when the million dollar movie was still in vogue on channel 9 in new york city this rudolph mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's christmas tree but it has never been released on home video too bad i believe i saw part of it on amc a few years ago before they cut many of their older films from the rotation tcm should take up the slack and play it at easter or on christmas eve any movie with santa aunt bee the hostess lady and an actor with the first name king can't be bad ann blyth as sally is a bundle of energy during her school years she rushes over to the chapel to pray for st ann to help and give guidance to her mixed up and financially strapped family it works so after she graduates she places a statue of st ann in her own bedroom at one point the entire residence is moved to another address i think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the and the dastardly fellow next door blyth is cute as a button edmund gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep all in all this is a satisfying movie experience
<START> cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise elizabeth shue actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood i literally vomited while watching this film of course i had the flu but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the br br why can't nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor heck nobody could do it better br br the search begins for nick's contract with lucifer or was it lou cipher from night train to terror
<START> this movie is wonderful i can watch it again and again robin hood is perfectly cast and marian is beautiful i personally think german man is the funniest character along with latrine and the sheriff while space balls got boring and stupid after a while this one always keeps your interest w o n d e r f u l this was a great film and never gets boring a great cast is in the roles and it is spoofed perfectly and makes so much sense and can be watched again and again you will love this film if you'll only watch it except if you hate comedy or does not think robin hood should be tampered with but this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great new flavor
<START> almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie from the misjudged often incomprehensible script onwards dr rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over wrought ott and middle aged and the men are young vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex the director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances br br there is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on dianne wiest slips into a pale impersonation of her bullets over broadway performance and poor old jane birkin flounders in her attempt to give a comic performance though you have to pity her as there is very little real comedy here the whole thing feels like a very low rent version of merchant le divorce which to be quite honest wasn't very good either
<START> i did not enjoy the film eraser whatsoever it's awful acting boring storyline and average special effects made this an annoying arnie film as it had a mountain of potential with other action films of the time eraser fell very short
<START> i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a chameleon who can play and sing anything br br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didn't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having i couldn't believe she was able to capture that and so naturally br br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts br br i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy
<START> if you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic the movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live sen delivers yet another masterpiece each and every actor of the movie was better than the other konkona sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic she pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age shabana azmi is incredible as usual she plays the dominating and fiercely independent elder sister of who takes care of her ailing sister and aging mother she refuses to accept that in spite of all her strength and courage she still feels lonely at times this should have been a very easy movie for rahul the role was least bit demanding and anyone could have done the role br br the ending of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park avenue experience it took me a while to digest that the movie had ended it left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed but later on it started sinking in my eyes are black but if everyone says they are blue will i still believe that its black
<START> this woman is a terrible comedian she can't crack a joke she has no real character this is another example of typical american rubbish that people laugh at because they have no idea how to react so they say to themselves well it's a comedy show so i'll laugh i guess br br i cannot stand this miserable woman and her pi poor excuse for comedy she does not deserve anything but booing br br why can't america dump this kind of delight and go for something that actually contains humour br br she is not funny not at all why oh why does even one person like this idiot
<START> this movie was horrible and it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie the way i look at it it's more like three mediocre day time disney cartoon episodes strung loosely together to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first atlantis movie which was way more well made and enjoyable and where do i even begin with the problems of this dvd the story the characters the pictures animation to me they're all bad and unwatchable firstly the story in this direct to video dvd is ridiculous and pointless the only good thing about it is that it is consistent that is consistently bad from the beginning to the end after the film's over i still don't know why milo has returned and how the incidents occur in the three small stories are related to each other or to atlantis itself and all i could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it the characters feel wooden and lack personality and the drawings look a lot different than that in the first you can tell they're obviously not from the hands of the same animators from the first one as the dvd played on i found myself caring less and less about what might happen to the characters and just hoping the film would end soon besides the story and the characters mentioned above the picture quality is poor in this one too probably one of the worst in those direct to video products that disney has ever released as a fan of the the original atlantis the lost empire i couldn't be more disappointed in milo's return which is a total waste of time and money thank goodness i rented it first instead of buying it even so i still wish i'd never seen this crap or even known its existence
<START> i'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because i really liked this film if you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring ben idiot affleck or some other hollywood loser it's an intellectual film you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that however if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice warning to parents it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed people who like euro flicks will like this one adam sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely not their style
<START> this film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make family entertainment meaning something which is enjoyable to people of all ages this particular wallace gromit can be enjoyed by everyone from toddlers who like the colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the adult references br br this film has direction as good as any i've ever seen and i mean that literally it is also packed with tiny bits of humor and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that i'm going to have to buy it if only in order to read all the signs and in w g's world br br i plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters then buy it on dvd you too should see it
<START> i can't believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie i wonder why maybe because of the book i have to admit it really doesn't follow the book for sure the book by dean koontz is much better but the movie is also good as well it has the suspense the acting are good especially michael ironside whom have given a superb acting in this movie br br come one give this movie a chance there are still lot more worse movie than this like sum of all fears phantoms the da vinci code this are some of the worse movie i have seen really boring if compared to watchers which really have great elements in the movie this movie contains great suspense and non stop action i'm looking for this movie but it is really hard to be found on dvd br br by da way i really recommended this movie to everybody watch it you will never regret br br 10 10
