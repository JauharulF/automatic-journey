<START> this film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc br br i couldn't say the acting was bad there were some good surprised faces by hamilton and sheen but then i really wouldn't have to br br risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains still if my life was flashing before my eyes i think i would fast forward this 90 minutes br br i have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published yes very resistant suit that sheen wears i made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again
<START> this is by far the worst non english horror movie i've ever seen the acting is wooden the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally braindead it's not even scary 2 out of 10 from me
<START> this movie was terrible it is not something that people should have to pay to see it looks like some christian group made it to convert people i don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv br br it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci fi film from the 50s but quickly changed about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about god and do you believe in jesus it quickly moves into pure religion territory br br i thought i was going to a sci fi movie the film has poor acting bad camera angles and is amateurish br br avoid it
<START> is definitely a memorable entry in the swords and sorcery category of movies i found along with quest for the mighty sword at a thrift shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2 00 each for them believable sets and costumes good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior mila make this an enjoyable watch a few problems though there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit like the cave men for one i didn't understand their purpose also this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters the snake was cool but i guess it does borrow a little from conan however any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a is ok by me see yor and battle for endor i think ator is cool oh and was anyone else reminded of by the villain or is it just me i give a 7 10
<START> beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel who apparently liked writing about frightened women his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier the play wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season it was only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone br br the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference himself rewrote his play for the screen so i'm wondering what he thought about that certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story br br that wasn't the only thing that was eliminated the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino's residence i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era br br the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino's home where she's hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day br br both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story
<START> when melville's pierre or the ambiguities hit bookstores in 1852 his first publication since moby dick a year earlier the public response was similar to that found among the imdb reviews of x newspapers even published headlines like melville insane which of course he wasn't but when one compares the writing styles found in moby dick and pierre one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former clearly he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now forgotten victorian romances that were easily his immortal moby dick he was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted and that surely would have sold his version of a victorian romance was a twisted cynical one perhaps but brilliant in its synthesis the alternate title the ambiguities is quite appropriate as pierre searches for and thinks he finds truth we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe as he searches for happiness he becomes more and more miserable br br x is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or nearly modern france though in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that melville could only hint at the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact the questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask yet the answers are left to the viewer br br i recommend a reading of the novel which is much shorter than moby dick before seeing this movie i hope more people discover this tantalizing film
<START> the lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men too confident with women don't let your girlfriend watch this movie
<START> i saw this at my local supermarket and i knew that debra was in it so i decided to buy it out of support for that sexy woman the plot and acting in this movie was terrible with the exception of debra wilson and i'm not just saying that because i love her she seriously was the only actor or actress who had any emotion in their acting and voice what i didn't get at the beginning is why the wife didn't just get back in her car instead of running at random like that it was so stupid and it's la nobody saw her being abducted on a public residential street nobody yeah that's realistic also in the park when charlie stole the woman's cell phone for some stupid reason they were hell bent on finding him and at one point when they did they had him at gunpoint over a cell phone in reality i doubt the lapd would go out of their way like that for a stupid cell phone the lady could've walked up to one of many of those cell phone and have it replaced the kids acting skills sucked too i think they were reading from a cue card or had somebody off camera whisper their lines because they'd be asked questions and would look around and then answer in a questionable voice i e yes i do miss daddy also how could there be all of those snipers be in the trees and on building rooftops in la without being seen i see this being played at 3 am on usa br br debra wilson fanatics will enjoy her parts she's the only actor with any real acting skills debra sweetheart stop doing these cheap d grade direct to video films maybe that'll change with the upcoming film she puts some jokes in there like when one of her superiors comes up and asks her who's she talking to she screams at her computer and goes damnit charlie i gave it a 4 10 a 4 only because of debra's good acting skills
<START> as an ex nuclear submarine officer i must admit this is my favorite submarine movie even exceeding hunt for red october someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie ok not realistic but it is a comedy and has all of the inside jokes from the submarine force a great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the orlando and our heroes on the diesel boat definitely by the way that means diesel boats forever but they want ten lines in order to post this is the admiral in charge here br br line 10
<START> people who say that some of what the looney tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something they weren't originally intended for children they were produced for the cinema to be shown before feature films and so they could show anything that they wanted s o s has that bad puddy tat sylvester finding tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him but two things work against sylvester granny is vehemently protecting the canary and sylvester easily gets seasick we don't see him throwing up but with his green face they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that and then of course the seemingly cute tweety has a bad ass streak br br it's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid to go all out whatever they thought about showing they showed we need to understand that cartoons weren't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children really funny
<START> this rubber monsters failed trying to be cool scary or even comedians looks like a wannabe movie of porkys or animals house but the sequences and history is not always clear also can't catch your attention all the movie looks cheap and with an amazing bad taste the only thing that's makes you laugh is the awful rubber monsters who must have a cost of one dollar each because the work or them never looks realistic the movements and expressions make looks the muppets as a pixar 3d movie when you compare with this hope marie carlton is the only thing that makes this awful movie and when she dies in the movie this turns even worst than before a movie who only must be seen in fast forward
<START> for those of you who like stand up comedians you must have heard about george carlin he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him br br but he died already god rest him in peace or hell he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity haha just joking don't take it serious br br it's bad for ya it's one of the latest works of george carlin before his death br br believe me one of his best works a must for any fan and an almost best of of all george carlin's jokes it's not a best of but it's really amusing br br it has less political and religious jokes it's only to have a great time br br editing is very good it's not a concert so it shouldn't have quick changing of shots the slow fading to other shot was well done fading is the best option in terms of editing
<START> the english patient not only has it all doomed romance tragic war great characters but it has it in a way that no other movie does it is a tale told through flashbacks featuring amazing performances by all involved visuals characters we care about and the most rapturous love story ever told a cinematic landmark the best film of 1996 and one of the very best of the 1990s
<START> a funny thing happened to me while watching mosquito on the one hand the hero is a deaf mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does mutilating mannequins er excuse me corpses through his images on the other hand the english version at least is very badly dubbed so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time this film is stupid funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town and lurid where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene not to mention the romantic aspect oh how sweet miss it
<START> impressive vision indeed and some hot chicks with swords flying around oh and those hypnotic chinese violins too let me think crouching tiger hidden dragon br br i kinda liked cthd with its down to earth simplicity and well developed characters that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the meaning of it br br hero on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually the larger than life moral was horrible i mean sacrifice your life sacrifice your beliefs sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed wtf br br no thanks br br but hay mao and g w b would be proud br br viva
