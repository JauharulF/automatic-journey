<START> unlike the previous poster i liked the celluloid treatment it looked good and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch to me it didn't detract at all from the power of the documentary's content in fact i felt the slickness of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content the previous poster was fair to liken the style to a nike commercial it definitely has that look but for my tastes it worked really well and i am far from a fan of nike commercials br br in my opinion this is how documentary film making should be done i can't wait to see the next installments from these promising filmmakers
<START> well that was sure a waste of dave talents wasn't it don't get me wrong when it comes to graphic design dave may be the best in the world right now the layered textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like peter greenaway and david fincher look like what they are has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics film even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered br br but this movie it's junk complete junk the story from neil gaiman is unfortunately exactly what gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off clive barker for the first time a pseudo mythic overblown dreamscape populated by characters which have titles in all capital letters rather than names everything is allegory to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama emotion or empathy from anyone involved people make pithy speaking in riddles which bring to mind what rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead might have sounded like if tom stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition really gaiman get over yourself you're not a prophet you're a poser br br directing doesn't help his pacing is poor taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events none of them given any weight the monsters don't menace because they're not foreshadowed simply thrown at the screen the plot doesn't engage because we don't really care about the rancid little protagonists half the dialogue muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks is unintelligible br br some of the visuals are pretty and i'm sure the fanboys will lick it up pity think of the amount of really good work could have produced if he hadn't been stuck with this lame project br br grade d d
<START> guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel friendship battle of good and evil all with a small budget child actors and few special effects something for spielberg and lucas to learn from a sixth grader kolya nick finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future he discovers a near perfect utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called that allows to read minds of humans and animals the device can be put to both good and bad use depending on whose hands it falls into when two evil space pirates from saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy nick with the pirates hot on his tracks he travels back to his time followed by the pirates and alice chaos confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings alice enrolls in the same school nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in pe class the catch is alice doesn't know what nick looks like while the pirates do also the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone hmm i wonder if this is where james cameron got the idea for terminator who gets to nick and first excellent plot non stop adventures and great soundtrack i wish hollywood made kid movies like this one
<START> if i could give this movie less than a 1 i would certainly do that i had read a review of this film in the la times and i found myself walking by the theater and remembered the review my wife and i were game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critic said you know critics sure enough give me a break with the awful acting horrible camera work poor use of the budget that has been mentioned over and over again as an excuse i've worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better it's the director and the producer that makes films work they choose the teams that's it if they don't put it together and make it work it simply won't so they didn't and it doesn't i don't think they can i just had to take the time to write this review though i'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this review i hope i'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well but in another career good luck
<START> running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny to's cannon in the solid good category as a crime thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it it's a johnny to film after all it has to br br andy lau has 72 hours to live he decides to play a strange cat and mouse game with a hostage negotiator of the hk police played by lau ching wan that's the plot in a nutshell on top of that to piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it however just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and well made crime flick which let's face it are dime a dozen he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience providing the soul and heart to the well oiled skeleton br br the concepts of synchronism and minimalism staples in his work are explored in great effect here always subtle letting the images speak for themselves giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots exemplary cutting to the score it's all here a small love story in a bus between andy lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the heart i'm talking about so simple yet so powerful ditto for lau's and lau ching wan's car scenes and the bowling room showdown br br however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece to has all the ability and down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times when he's good he's real good there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie i'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it he can make a really great film as it is this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable underneath the slick hk style it's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film worth watching definitely
<START> the puffy chair was a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life which cannot be retrieved and spent in a more worthwhile way even the blair witch project was a better use of life's precious moments it must be called the puffy chair because only chairs could accommodate the extremely up' self important brothers who it out for public consumption and obviously they are so full of themselves that they have assumed the public would actually want to consume their drool the puffy chair made the wooly boys seem like a cinematic masterpiece valley of the dolls beyond valley of the dolls pink flamingos texas chainsaw massacre night of the living dead urban cowboy the blob all of these would be a better use of one's time than viewing the puffy chair the characters portrayed are either too predictable or too lacking in normal emotional reflexes to even come close to being likable or believable also at one point in the film while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town if one watches closely one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the southern united states and the other half is located in maine that's some town eh
<START> alan rickman emma thompson give good performances with southern new orleans accents in this detective flick it's worth seeing for their scenes and scene with hal holbrook these three actors to entertain us no matter what the movie it seems the plot for the movie shows potential but one gets the impression in watching the film that it was not pulled off as well as it could have been the fact that it is cluttered by a rather uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers really muddles things the movie is worth a view if for nothing more than entertaining performances by rickman thompson and holbrook
<START> someone i know said that there was this film called that was probably up my street i was told about this movie after watching final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about near deth experience br br i bought the dvd of at the modest price of 5 pounds got home and watched it and i could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this film hadn't been in my life before the film is about a group of medical students try to see what it's like after near death experience but then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically br br acting from kevin bacon and keifer sutherland is great as you would expect from the pair and joel made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys br br this is an edgy and stylish thriller bound to please nay type of film fan
<START> too bad this movie isn't while nemesis game is mildly entertaining i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie especially the situations that sara was putting herself into are we supposed to believe that br br 1 this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles br br 2 the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun but don't put the whole i never sinned riddle together until the very end and then and then get this she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together i know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think we're that stupid br br 3 when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde there is not one topless chick in the whole building nada c'mon i know it's canada but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweed br br and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that site that when he over the link the cursor stayed an arrow and didn't turn into a little hand like all do when you click on a i mean if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie at least get the little things right geez
<START> thirst br br i found that this film was beautifully crafted the cinematography was well above excellent i though almost any frame could be frozen and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph the use of color stands out most in many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawless br br park chan direction was fantastic he had me believing unwaveringly in his far fetched universe there were several touches of verbal and visual humor of a dark nature that just added another depth to the picture as a whole br br the acting i would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough br br for me the only place where this film lacked was in the story at times i will not lie the goings on between characters just did not make sense sometimes the story flow was clunky overall i was disappointed with the subdued narrative and i felt it ran a little too long br br but i still recommend this film for its vision its visual flourish its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting film even if imperfect 9 10
<START> i was initially interested in this film after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking screenshots and the promise was there for a gripping horror film of the dario argento style admittedly i must say that argento's films have occasionally been rather incoherent and some feel like a handful of visually impacting set pieces loosely strung together with a vague connecting plot br br since argento is credited as writer for this i have to say i'm not really surprised even his masterpiece suspiria when examined exhibits the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for the aesthetic impact however suspiria also had the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists as well as scenes that contributed ultimately to the eventual resolution br br the church on the other hand has none of these things it has no main character no protagonist whatsoever it furthermore has no real plot to speak of and no crescendo no climax no denouement and no resolution it is a completely hollow incoherent work that views as if argento sat down and thought 'hey that would make an interesting scene visually let's do it ' the film is a series of these scenes br br initially it might be interesting and soavi's direction is excellent i must say cannot be faulted for the material as it is made as compelling as possible however such good direction calls attention to the horrible failings of the script and there is absolutely no sense in it the attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing more than plagiarism of carpenter's film prince of darkness events happen solely because the script wishes them to and reactions to those events are completely implausible the narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief it's too ludicrous added to this are numerous factual errors that are so glaringly showcased that it becomes embarrassing br br if it had been more overtly artistic and edited down into a different work it might have been chilling or tense if it had been fleshed out into an actual cohesive narrative it might have been gripping but it was none of these the best it managed was confusing and at times infuriating plots are introduced but never followed characters are forgotten about and altered arbitrarily no logic is ever applied to any situation it might have been scary or interesting but to elicit that sort of feeling takes more effort on the part of a screenwriter much more br br all in all the church is not worth viewing for anyone but total enthusiasts of italian horror that is more style than substance this is argento's style at its worst and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism
<START> on a dark gloomy new year's eve night an ill nurse her life slowly away demands that david holm be presented to her at once we don't yet know who david holm is or why this nurse wishes to see him but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time on the other side of the town nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery holm victor who also directed and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the new year here we can tell just when to drink the new year in exclaims holm casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness little does he know however that he will not be alive to greet it br br to pass the time holm cheerfully recites a ghost story he'd once had a friend name george a merry fellow who was smarter than the rest of us on one new year's eve several years ago george has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year doing death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased and gentlemen george died last new year's eve concludes holm happily not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs br br as fate has it of course an unexpected violent encounter results in holm's death just on the stroke of midnight as the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body he witnesses to his horror the distant approach of a phantom carriage the driver a frail cloaked figure a sickle tightly in his hand steps down from the carriage and approaches we are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit george preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor br br considering the era in which is made the special effects in this film are absolutely superb cinematographer julius used double exposure photography to create the eerie ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver even today the end result is highly effective a particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man another scene eerily reminiscent of jack torrance jack nicholson in stanley kubrick's 'the shining ' involves holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children br br genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution victor is a fine work of cinema successfully portraying holm's steady alcoholic decline his inevitable day of judgment and a final hopeful possibility of redemption
<START> bob cummings is excellent in this as this technically brilliant hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today priscilla lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other blonde's that worked with hitchcock later she just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today br br there are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today every person in the cast performs well there are several great backdrops in the black white film br br this was the first film at universal for hitchcock long run between the feature films he did at universal plus the television series hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there this fact gets lost in film history br br norman lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film the story moves along really well including hitchcock's only filmed western sequence this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it
<START> so i'm wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from miss congeniality did ms bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the before gracie hart as many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest br br the two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films as has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes br br one last peeve using the term serial killer is false advertising murdering one person even if it's a premeditated murder does not make you a serial killer you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer
<START> this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects sex and love women's emotional abuse of men men's physical abuse of women sexual child abuse fresh approach to religion in real life and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music br br i promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant br br and the dvd has some great features including samuel jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues br br this movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers
