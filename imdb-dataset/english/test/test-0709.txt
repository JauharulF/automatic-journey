<START> this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time it's dull ponderous badly acted and teeth pretentious br br i watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold before realising there wasn't any the shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer space br br the only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket how scary is that and i did like the used as extras i suppose they are least cheap though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna br br this film is so dreadful it should have a public health warning there was a queue at my local video store when i took it back of people demanding their money back i kid you not
<START> i will never ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 even at the young age i remember thinking this is a baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes baywatch tolerable the girls in bathing suits nonetheless i was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house the high point of pacific blue was an episode in which a couple of out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns on bikes as a thirteen year old i never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously even i knew that the task of going out and acquiring for murder is a task that should never come before borrowing someones car for the day that had been the defining moment of this show simple crimes and situations tailor made by hack writing so they could be taken care of by the unsung hero of the crime fighting world the bike cop does not get much dumber
<START> the st experiment claims this ain't no walk in the woods a direct slap in the face of blair witch where blair witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion the st the viewer's patience one must say however that this is destined to be a camp classic br br warning spoiler is forthcoming br br i viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's paranormal consultant troy taylor spoke about the making of the movie should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information stop reading here for those of you who can't resist read on my friends and all shall be told br br mr taylor a writer of rather ghost stories which he claims are all true informed the audience at this video screening that the st experiment was not a documentary shock amazing as if we didn't know he informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and by the film's producers matter of fact he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in louisiana but rather in california all four participants were true actors notice i didn't say good one of the participants is actually a special effects technician on er br br what infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true it feebly attempts to outdo the blair witch project by claiming it's true whereas blair witch was a hoax the amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as surround yourself with the white light and i love the ghosts the st experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle boo and chant i love the ghosts br br talk about false advertising true stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood boy scouts troop set up a haunted house from the bug in the sandwich ooh scary to the annoying madison from the which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an board to the two mice being found under a bed the st is one embarrassing hoax of a movie lion's gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be br br the st experiment a comedic look at how not to make a movie
<START> it looks like people involved with this movie are stuffing the ballot box to boost its ratings the good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it i suppose that makes me the 19th i have no involvement with the flick and don't know anyone who did and i'm a long time imdb user check my vote record and reviews over the past seven years so i promise i'm giving an honest and unbiased opinion it's coming to you from a 30 year horror fan who has also appeared in a couple of low budget flicks himself br br aside from a couple of interesting video effects bloody nightmare is incoherent boring and technically flawed beyond all reason it was apparently shot on silent stock and the audio then dubbed in most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin can and a piece of string anyhow more than three quarters of the dialog is inaudible br br i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was or even if there was one it seems like the director is mostly impressing himself with long panning shots of the corners of table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pad the film out that would be a problem if one were actually developing a plot and making a film that had some sense of pacing in this case though the rule doesn't apply it doesn't matter how scenes are shot because they don't add up to a story br br watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level whatever people who worked on it are writing and however they're trying to influence the ratings here on imdb this is just bad tedious stuff br br that's the honest truth if you're thinking of spending your money or time on this one think again it's easy to find something better because you won't find much worse br br and that's the unbiased unvarnished truth
<START> this movie was awful especially considering the work that must have gone into its production though it's not as bad as ax 'em it is quite awful take into account the obvious rip offs from gladiator and raiders of the lost ark and what do you get this smorgasbord of awful make up and wooden acting br br the movie starts as most zombie movies nowadays do a montage of interesting jump cuts and a radio broadcast of the outbreak at hand we see our hero quite possibly the worst 'zombie hunter' in modern era counted about four or five times where he either scratched his head with the barrel of his pistol or looked down the barrel while blowing cutting off fingers of zombies we later learn that these fingers are collected for br br well seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing of zombies going so far as to purchase chum gasp from his french buddy hans who isn't really french speaks with an odd middle eastern accent as uses the chum to collect a plentiful bounty from lost hills all hell breaks loose br br and cue the awfulness of the movie the zombies are put together quite poorly i've seen comments praising their make up but it was quite amateur in my opinion obvious halloween were used to make the zombies' faces and there were points at which one girl looked as if she were donning a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face oy vey br br to sum the next sixty minutes up in a few lines is back stabbed by hans who made a deal with some other zombie hunters blythe being the ringleader gives him a second chance gets back stabbed again by hans then shoots hans and gets to union city where he finds blythe is poisoning the cities for profit br br that's it really in regards to plot when reaches union city all the baddies are gathered around in a house that evidently is so massive it takes hours to reach the top floor people die lives and the movie ends with one of those cynical is he going to kill himself scenes br br end spoilers i'm going to have to blame most of this mess on nott the direction was awful every character featured a scowl other than hans who was easily the best 'actor' in this group of macbeth rejects when they reach union city a hoard of zombies attacks the crew and the zombies were obviously given no tips or ideas about how to walk as if your appendages were rotten one woman is swaying as if she's swimming in mid air on a sunday stroll br br some movies are awful this movie is one of them simply on the grounds of how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing works occasionally but in this regard where the story was already in shambles it doesn't br br avoid it unless you want a decent laugh
<START> head is one of those films you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see but once they do they'll fall in love with it i don't know how many times this has happened to me this film is just so funny and bizarre really a deconstruction of everything the monkees had been up to this point in their career a lot the credit goes to bob who pretty much ended the career with this film my guess is he wanted to get out of directing the tv show and get into features which he did in a big way after this one micky dolenz is absolutely hilarious i can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this film this film has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense i feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to build and it wouldn't surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic
<START> this is a truly hilarious film and one that i have seen many times drew barrymore is brilliant as josie geller as is david arquette as her brother you cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like her outfits are wacky and weird and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently the gorgeous michael vartan was adorable as the teacher wish there had been teachers like that when i was at high school and boss is fantastic this is a film you could watch again and again with a fabulous sound track one for all those at school in the 90's to watch
<START> i've been wanting to see this movie for a very long time i eventually just bought it on e bay since it's so hard to find state side but the wait was somewhat worth it br br i can't say the movie was great and i can't say that the movie was hilarious but it was good and it has some pretty funny points that aside the shots in this movie are just beautiful and the entire cast especially brenda blethyn someone i hadn't seen before sadly were excellent br br in the end this is a feel good romantic comedy and i recommend checking it out unless you've just had a death in the family br br if anything the final chapter is highly worth the money
<START> dead gentlemen productions has put together a film with amazing production values considering their budget anyone that has ever played any role playing game particularly any fantasy rpg they play dungeons and dragons in the movie will love this movie brilliant performances all around especially with regards to the dual nature of the principles playing their players and their characters anyone who has ever filmed or acted in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they put into this project this movie and its prequel is to fantasy movies and role playing games what blazing saddles is to westerns parody of the highest order i only have a couple minor complaints about the movie itself none of which will prevent me from buying the dvd as soon as it's available only 6 more weeks i'm counting the days br br 1 when lodge is talking to joanna about joining the gaming group he hands her a copy of the dungeons and dragons players handbook and says this will tell you everything you need to know the camera hovers too long on a shot of the book and the moment really seemed like a commercial br br 2 the jokes are hilarious but they seem unevenly spread throughout the movie the last third of the movie after the almost continuous barrage of visual and verbal humor preceding it slows down a bit as if the narrative was catching up with the jokes odd but blazing saddles always struck me that way as well and i love that movie too br br one of the narrative strengths of the story is the unresolved nature of the romantic subplot will joanna become the gm's girlfriend will she go back to cass or will the three maintain a platonic friendship deepened by the camaraderie of role playing yes that sounds sappy but there are a couple of saccharine moments particularly when cass and lodge make up at the end but the movie spans one week in terms of human relationships those questions could not be answered in a week the fact that the characters' relationships are left undefined strikes me as better than the more classical choices you see in most movies like the girl gets her prince and they move into the castle or the prince sinks into the north atlantic after three trite tedious and predictable hours the writers really seem to have a grasp of the psychology of the characters and you can see the characters both the gamers and the player's characters change over the course of the movie but not suddenly and not unbelievably br br i would love to hear more wisdom from brother silence the man who stands out in darkness is fluorescent
<START> charlie wilson tom hanks is a hard partying womanizing texas congressman with no discernible legislative record in 1980 he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of afghanistan which is in the midst of a brutal war with the ussr on the auspices of his old flame arch conservative texas socialite joanne herring julia roberts he travels to afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees he returns to the us determined to help the afghans only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use undeterred wilson recruits herring and the vulgar outcast cia agent gust phillip seymour hoffman to begin a convoluted arms deal involving israel egypt pakistan saudi arabia and a mostly unknowing us congress ultimately the afghans defeat the soviets but while america celebrates their victory wilson and find their warnings about the instability of post war afghanistan falling on deaf ears br br charlie wilson's war is slick brain candy a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average film goer the movie assembles an astonishing array of talent both in front of and behind the camera and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time the film's has only one flaw which we'll arrive at later as an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th century's largest covert war was waged and perhaps the way that things get done by the cia and other intelligence agencies it's fascinating br br the movie is interesting on a number of levels the story portrayed in the movie with all of its outrageous double dealings sneaky covert operations and perhaps most of all its success would be so outrageous as a work of fiction that it could easily be dismissed as a satire but things really did work out this way at least within reasonable bounds the film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices even embracing them yet willing to embrace a righteous cause herring is something of an elitist and her born again attitude of righteousness is off putting yet she's deeply committed to the cause of the afghan people is a cia outsider with an attitude problem looked down upon because of his street background yet his love of country and hatred of communism are unwavering the fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the ussr is not only proof that anyone can make a difference but also that truth is stranger than fiction it's also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy not too surprising given that our writer is aaron but it's an interesting way to approach this story br br the movie does however have one drawback which is a bit surprising the film seems to unabashedly celebrate wilson and co 's achievement this is fine nothing wrong with defeating the soviet union is there until one considers that out of the ashes of the soviet defeat in afghanistan came the taliban and eventually al qaeda regardless of the us's level of responsibility it happened and the movie's portrayal of wilson's success is almost unmitigated to be fair the movie does address this issue towards the end with a rather topical speech by wilson about the us's inability to clean up after themselves but it's done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it the overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the afghans defeat the soviets this isn't a fatal drawback mind you but it's one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie br br the film's talent is remarkable the legendary mike nichols delivers a slick gorgeous looking production the material is perfectly suited to his understated wry directorial style delivers yet another brilliant screenplay the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic exchanges the best being the scotch bottle discussion between wilson and and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it the film's cast is a marvel tom hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause julia roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed joanne and phillip seymour hoffman steals every scene par usual as the abrasive gus the always lovely amy adams takes another step on her road to stardom as wilson's long suffering assistant and ned beatty om puri emily blunt christopher denham and ken flesh out the supporting cast br br charlie wilson's war is an intelligent and fun movie a wonderful bit of a bit more than light entertainment the fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldn't be held against it it's brilliant at what it does br br 8 10
<START> this movie comes down like a square peg in a square hole a poorly made peg a peg so cheap it couldn't even be produced in a assembly line in chinatown mexico in fact when you try to press the peg into the hole for which it is obviously designed it crumbles into sticky disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and won't wash off is such a peg br br this movie is so mind bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created a movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature some freakish entity that in the corner of a dank office somewhere and and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at only science would be interested in such a thing anyone not bent on studying it would exhume it from this world br br what it comes down to is this if you're the kind to enjoy first year violin recitals racism or coke zero it might just be your birthday
<START> hi br br blade is an sensational action movie the hero wesley snipes and the villain have done justice to their roles br br the movie's action sequences are better then matrix br br wesley snipes is one the best action heroes ever br br if u like action vampire movies this is the one br br the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before but these is the best of them br br enjoy the ride
<START> i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth i'm not saying all these shows are bad but they aren't good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypes that's right stereotypes unfortunately this is a show for the of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth punk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth punk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the the bumbling sidekick can't you make the sidekick an equal ass kicker
<START> my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was though my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act by the way if you're worried about that don't be i'm not exactly one of her fans but i must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene overall all the actor's were very good i'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since i'm sure you know about it the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them especially elisha cuthbert and chad michael murray's characters we meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of amityville horror or texas chainsaw massacre and feels almost documentary like rather than a music video don't get me wrong i loved texas chainsaw and enjoyed amityville br br now for the death scenes in most slasher movies whenever a character is stabbed or killed the scene immediately cuts away to another scene but not in this one when a character is about to die they die pretty gruesomely but the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim i won't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself br br while this is a great slasher movies it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films exploring a creepy house when you shouldn't be getting a ride with a suspicious character splitting up and screaming so the killer can hear you also there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didn't add to the film at all you could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out it would not have affected the movie at all br br basically if you are a horror film fan see this movie you will not be disappointed it's got all that's needed to make it a great slasher film possibly the best of the year even though it's kinda early the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie if you hate horror films chances are you may like this one and if you are divided i encourage you to give it a shot
<START> awful more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema see how it sticks painfully in the memory as a 16 yr old lad mark hamill was the older generations skywalker and wasn't great at that he was worse in this plus a dour soundtrack by then jericho there is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema arthur 2 on the rocks funny how that question what is the worst film you have ever seen is is easier than what is the best film which incidentally varies between the italian job original untouchables casino things to do in denver goodfellas getting a sense of what i like this will fool you finding nemo pirates of the caribbean and moulin rouge please never watch this film or it will stick in your memory too
