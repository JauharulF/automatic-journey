<START> this film blade master may be cheap clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon he goes through obstacles as a character who is just more than muscle power although he has quite is lot i would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like conan the barbarian which is the least i can say quite brainless it doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is conan but it gives ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian for a lower budget movie this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable the villain has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie even if ator seems way too fit for the task to loose br br what gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky but worth of mention the fight with the serpent god even though he is a gigantic puppet is well handled as the snake with good lightnings remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing the movie climaxes in a most unusual way quite anachronic but breathtaking the sequence the scene itself is not introduced properly read not at all where did ator get that machine it's pretty unconvincing but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence that standalone is the culminating point in the movie elevating ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been br br if blade master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks it's a bigger surprise considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil the truth it speaks and the heart it shows that this movie is so i suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems
<START> the subject matter of this film is potentially depressing a man about thirty with no job little education three kids from a failed relationship living in his parents' house but with a dream of directing feature films but about a half hour into the movie you realize that mark has a bottomless supply of drive and ambition it's just that it's all channeled into his need to direct movies and nothing else will make him happy the movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum but in the end you come away feeling happy because you've just gotten to know some wonderful people go to see this you'll end up wishing it was longer
<START> this film is a knockout fires on the plain referred to is the burning off at the end of harvest time a happy memory for tamura he relives this in his mind many time's and at the end of this bleak film like a man dying of thirst he he is home and this last illusion is all he has left billy wilder's the big carnival ace in the hole is the only film that comes to mind that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by kon ichikawa while i think the whole film is brilliant two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of japanese soldiers trying to escape crawling on there are ambushed by americans and massacred true horror and as an american soldier and a pretty philippine girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road she smiles as she with the yank then her face changes to rage as she see's two japanese soldiers trying to she grabs a gun and kills them with joy the american soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance to me this speaks volumes at the committed by the japanese in the philippines all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it
<START> for people who have absolutely no idea of what a comedy is that not only includes the people who liked this movie but the people who made it what could they possibly have been thinking madonna playing judy holliday please she can't even play madonna if there actually is a madonna i hope griffin dunne was paid well he deserved every penny he got because if this didn't kill his career nothing will i'm sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it feeling like their pockets had been picked madonna is apparently past the point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress but you can't help feeling embarrassed for her anyway she has no connection with the rest of the cast it appears like she showed up on the set and said ok i'm here i'm gonna embarrass myself by doing the absolute worst judy holliday impression anyone's ever seen now stay the hell out of my way and then proceeded to do exactly that i know the phrase rotten madonna movie is redundant but it certainly fits this it's painful to watch a totally inept and talentless actress make a complete fool of herself but it apparently doesn't bother her as she does it again and again br br the only remotely funny thing about this comedy is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to make it now that's funny
<START> in my opinion a good documentary especially one dealing with controversial political issues should be informative and as unbiased as possible the point should be revealing the truth this means in particular having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides this film is a failure in this regard most of the interviews included in this film consist of men off the street on the question of peace in the holy land the wall itself the supposed subject of the film is given no serious treatment at all for most of the interviews the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as what do you think of the wall she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it outside of one interviewee the israeli general in charge of the construction we have no experts on the subject to provide us with the context e g how and when the project began whether it has been successful which groups are for and which against the project etc br br outside of the interviews a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes such as head on shots of the wall construction of the wall and people getting off a bus these shots take up far too much time in my opinion it's nice to see what the wall looks like but the 20 30 minutes of head on filming of the wall and only the wall are excessive clearly these shots accompanied by arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall
<START> specks of white and various shapes a beautiful nude random images that is what this little experimental short film is br br it's kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films and a fascination with the bizarre this film just didn't do it for me br br i'm not sorry i watched it but if there is any underlying meaning in it i don't get it visually it is not that outstanding in my humble opinion as an example of i suppose it would fit in quite well since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason though i would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting way br br but to each his own
<START> this is a stereotype plot a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight br br the fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in a way that 1 1 is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once this results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorly br br there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment br br these guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn't up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had a small budget i don't know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10
<START> this movie has a look and feel of many fresh directors closeups and focus on the emotions being experienced by the actors the point of the film was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast the point being have faith in jesus christ and the morman church oh and if you read or hear anything contrary to the teachings of the prophet it is just fuel for hatred
<START> i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes unfortunately i don't remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal braces jane wore and i didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a popstar and you like high waisted jeans ankle socks and knee length skirts then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you
<START> i first saw the knowledge during a thames television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new i enjoyed it very much along with danger uxb br br that a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it's originality and the quality of the performances by the cast br br i looked for a dvd copy here in the u s a and found none i finally gambled and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy
<START> enjoyed this film which deals entirely about an average family so it appears ben travis jeff daniels plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many however he hates it very much and even his father ben has very little to say to his other son tim emile and even his daughter penny michelle williams who is fortunate to be away in college the mother sandy sigourney weaver tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also a very tragic event happens in the family which changes everyone's personality young and old start using drugs smoking pot and drinking all the time at parties there is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that sandy travis finally tells her son tim
<START> that movie while slightly flawed was entirely entertaining about half an hour into be cool i started to have hollywood homicide flashbacks but guess what this is worse even the dance number is bad i like most of the cast in this movie so that makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it but i feel obligated the rock andre 3000 and vince vaughn were in a comedy no one else seemed to decide what movie genre they were acting in i feel bad for travolta because he brought the same chili palmer from get shorty to this movie he was totally consistent in the role but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb i was going to give this movie 4 10 because i like the actors so much but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so asinine i couldn't believe the performers actually said it if you want to go to the movies this weekend there should still be some oscar contenders out there that would be a much better way to spend your time
<START> i am surprised so few have good words for this movie for its time the 80's it was a very entertaining and engaging story casting was good story was good special effects were remarkable for the time period deserving of an 8 10
<START> dan finnerty and the dan band are so o o o o o good they must be seen to believe does anyone out there have a copy of the bravo concert for sale please if there is an upcoming release let us all know i checked the bravo site but there is no future date scheduled for a repeat performance by the most appealing guys ever choreographed the dan band what great energy they exude flinging themselves about with cute american boy attitude based on butch sensitivity being wrapped up in sequins and tears making men and women alike fall in love with them i hope enough people can influence the powers that be at bravo to bring the show back into our lives as a semi annual special
<START> the martial arts movies got huge in the 60's in parts of asia but with the growing popularity of the infamous shaw brothers films america was bound to catch on this movie was the first to be presented in america under the warner bros label and it did in fact start a craze here that flooded the 70's with martial arts films many of the films to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like enter the dragon which came out shortly after this one became huge success stories and made superstars out of these fighters br br fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds up most shaw brothers films are as good today as they were back then and truth be told no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by the shaw bros back in the day br br i like to think martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action well same goes with m a films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story this one is an exception it doesn't have an amazing story but there is one there br br the main guy played by lo lieh actually stands out amongst karate film heroes he never brags and he never fights just because he can he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most but when he must fight he is damn well the greatest alive i really loved this character many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were just presented so amazingly even a small role with bolo yeung can be seen as the huge mongolian and bolo is in my top 5 as greatest martial artist film stars ever he was also in the above mentioned enter the dragon br br the production as i've said over and over is wonderful you can't beat the the direction was something unlike i have seen much in films of the 70's the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others when the light shines on chi hands as he does the iron fist its pure beauty br br the music was superb as well martial arts films were to asia what westerns were to italy two separate art forms with so much in common the countries making these films had all genres but the japanese films were what was making waves there as the spaghetti westerns were in italy with their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck as seen in movies like 5 fingers of death the fights were easily compared to leoni cowboy stand offs and the music tied the genres together so well the music here borrowed a little from ironside but it was still very original br br many films were inspired by this one and when i watch it i can see everything from the master killer to bloodsport having been influenced the most obvious movie to have been influenced was kill bill which to me is the greatest of all time many of the sets quentin used are complete replicas of ones seen here and he used the music from this film even though the music he used was the music borrowed from ironside and the fight scene at the end of kill bill vol 1 with the bride and o ren is at times exact in comparison to the fight with chi and the japanese thug at the end of this movie br br i have seen many martial arts films a few even better but this is a must see for fans of the genre you can't go wrong here the movie starts off slow but 15 20 minutes into it it picks up and doesn't slow down
