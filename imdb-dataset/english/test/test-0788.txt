<START> br br a few years ago i bought a movie called the cellar i had heard that it was supposed to be a great movie but it turned out that it was a flop and a b movie br br the story is good but there are no good effects in the movie maybe they didn't have enough money for that on the budget br br if you choose to watch this movie be sure to watch it three times the first only and last time
<START> i saw this film 2 weeks prior to going on a holiday so for me it was really just to get my mind in mode for my holiday the film boasts some sweet skills throughout the films in the action scenes these moments were great a bit like watching extreme sports channel sadly the story was quite honestly awful the acting was generally alright with a fairly small cast this film is apparently comedy at least it tries to be comical but it seems like the comedy and the storyline was written by a teenager the story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be anything more than a small snigger a few times during the movie it might be worth renting just to see the action but then again there are plenty of movies out there that are totally devoted to stunts and don't feature a un funny badly written story
<START> very nice movie i was browsing the channels on my tv and i usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then i saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where i saw this movie at first when i saw the title the cure i thought it's gonna be boring but then i got hooked when i saw brad was in this movie because of one of my favorite movie of all time is the client where brad also stars then the scenes was getting better and better the story is so beautiful and very touching i cried hard in this movie which i don't usually do great casting and there are so many beautiful lines quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard now i bought my own copy on dvd and i always recommend it to everyone
<START> having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock's performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky self effacing roles ms bullock's performance in serious roles see hope floats speed 2 28 days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the sub plot of sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catch me if can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplin's token partner love interest character br br spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv of the week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way out of
<START> this is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people one of whom is married to someone else it ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever and i'm a die hard romantic my husband opted out after the first hour of its three by which time little had transpired the desert scenery is spectacular with the endless sand and the sunshine on golden hair however cinematography does not a brilliant film make unless it's a national geographic travelogue the magnificent saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig br br the movie revolves around a badly burned dying pilot named count de who is left in the care of a canadian army nurse hana during world war ii italy he appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession his story is very slowly revealed with the help of a man from his past named caravaggio who mysteriously appears at his deathbed was a hungarian cartographer employed by the royal geographical society to chart the sahara desert he entered into an affair with the wife katherine of a fellow explorer who proved to be a british spy meanwhile in the present nurse has her own affair with a sikh nicknamed kip who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines br br my quarrels with this movie are many length and tedium for starters i don't fault the acting in particular it simply isn't a good story caravaggio seems unnecessary his connection to sketchy he provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film br br the core problem is that the two parties of this affair and katharine are woefully unsympathetic characters shallow and dull they simply aren't very nice thus there is no one to cheer for is cool aloof haughty and eventually disgustingly possessive of another man's wife katharine is likewise detached and nasty not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husband apart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies br br this is a tale of lust rather than love with such pearls as 'i can still taste you' ridiculously to a colleague his erotic obsession with the in his beloved's neck surely more indicative of a focus on body the victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband geoffrey who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance it's all quite sordid and disgusting charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion all as silent night is being sung in the background i'm not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carol's purity with their selfish lust but i definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone we have full frontal nudity with katharine but their sex scenes come across as cold selfish lustful and sometimes downright hateful not warm loving giving nor even truly passionate if either of these two feels any emotion for the other it is a totally selfish one and definitely not love as i define the word br br return to the cave of the swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing not at all corpse like of course this is all for dramatic effect as the romantics watching this tale normally i'd be one of them would not appreciate a decaying putrid corpse in order to retrieve his adulterous lover's body he has betrayed his comrades the allies by giving his maps to the nazis the english being cast as the villains of the piece regardless of whether or not he's keeping his final promise to katharine his traitorous act is not something i admire much br br kip seems a pleasant fellow and hana generally likable but their romance is not in the least engaging merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting moving back and forth between the two settings past sahara desert and present italy proved distracting and unpleasant but really both stories were dull as dishwater the only spark of interest in the whole picture was kip's tense mine disarming scene br br not being totally heartless i did have some sympathy for the current severely burned and dying state however perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose we are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate book to console him as he's dying br br the amazing director david lean's masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic immoral tale yes lawrence of arabia also has a desert but in lean films doctor zhivago brief encounter those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint guilt and some regard for the betrayed spouse as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair in ryan's daughter the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness br br this movie is a supposedly intellectual enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story its best picture oscar does not speak well for the academy for those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie the answer is simple it's awful
<START> as one who frequently goes to the movies i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year ed harris and cuba gooding jr gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre
<START> i would consider myself a fan of dean koontz having read a number of his novels and liked them all but unfortunately i never got around to reading watchers so i'm left with no choice but to rate this film on it's own merits rather than comparing it to the book that i haven't read i went into this expecting something awful and while i didn't exactly get a brilliant horror film i am lead to believe that it's fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it's own right watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie the plot obviously takes some influence from predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab it's not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man's daughter has picked up an ultra intelligent runaway dog a secret government agency is soon on the case as the murders continue the boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too br br the script for this film was originally written by paul haggis who later disowned it i don't know why Â the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit crash anyway the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog who aside from being rather cute is also the best actor in the film corey haim hot off the success of the lost boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film the plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy but the ridiculousness of it all pulls it through during the more awkward moments michael ironside also appears in the film and does well as the 'bad cop' side of the government agents the monster is of course one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory although unfortunately we don't get to see a lot of it and when we finally do it's rather disappointing obviously the filmmakers had seen bigfoot and the hendersons still this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and i'd recommend to any viewer of eighties horror
<START> you can read all kinds of references into the world of idiocracy a futuristic world populated by pampered self indulgent morons spoon fed by the technology of a bygone era this idea has its precedent in h g wells' the time machine and huxley's brave new world amongst other satires br br early in the film a narrator explains the quick degradation of humanity over five hundred years but does not fill in the gaps of where all the futuristic technology came from in the meanwhile most of the criticism of this very fun and funny film seems to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world isn't realistic as if realism has ever been a necessary quality of satire is brazil realistic how about futurama or hell how about gulliver's travels i thought not idiocracy while maybe not as pointed as the best of the genre hits the same notes and generally does so successfully br br besides i didn't find the futuristic technology to be a problem it is pretty easy to figure out that mike judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product so that even total idiots can use them as in brave new world the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self sufficiency at some point in the past apparently created by the now extinct 'smart people' in order to placate an increasingly stupid populace leaving the remainder of humanity free to indulge all the worst most selfish impulses they can come up with and grow even stupider the film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity as everything begins to fall apart for good it may still be unrealistic but if so it's a remarkably well presented brand of unrealism br br the stupid people take up most of the screen time of course but they're just the victims they don't know any better mike judge saves his real hate for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the film begins but who are very much alive right now in the 21st century people like scientists who chase hair growth and prolonged erections for no other reason than the possibility that they'll turn a profit on their snake oil treatments people like politicians who let corporations simply purchase the fda and fcc people like media executives and their yuppie stooges who promote stupidity who enable the destruction of all culture morality and health to make a quick buck br br after all who is really to blame the or the the paris of the world or the brilliant executives and advertisers that put her on tv and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there this is all implicit in idiocracy though a line here a hint there witness the hilarious auto doctor which literally does all the work in the health care system it's one of the few aspects of the movie that's not pounded into the ground by the unnecessary narrator it's just there for the viewer to pick up or not but it is one of the most interesting themes in a movie that's much smarter than any other comedy of the year br br pity that so many people will leave the film thinking it's just an excuse to show rear ends farting and people being hit in the groin not that that stuff isn't funny too and maybe it is a little pandering but in idiocracy it's just not as simple as it seems
<START> having been familiar with hartley's the go between for a good while both in its original book form and in its disappointing pinter losey film adaptation this was interesting stuff the proves almost a mirror image at times set in a slightly less distant period for the main part featuring exposure of the british class system and containing a set piece sports match boxing takes the place of cricket that reveals rather a lot about br br this refreshes in its small scale character focus you do not exactly get to lady franklin and in the novelistic sense but this distance is appropriately played out in telling body language and inflection from the actors your distance from ever fully sympathizing with any one true character mirrors the dormant that so dooms the central relationship miles and shaw are wonderfully subtle and we see more in their 'less' never once are these showy performances they are fittingly interpretations that create the impression of these characters having life outsides the confines of the film all other parts are very satisfactorily handled though they are far smaller in this film than i presume in the novel and compared indeed to the go between a stunning work about disillusionment br br the disillusion at the centre of this film is so sadly and movingly conveyed in the late scenes where shaw kisses miles and is rejected and then where a drunken confronts and lady franklin it's a howling shame that what would have been an incredibly poignant ending of spoiled desolate lives at either side of the screen is with a decidedly odd little coda one is entirely bemused by the jump in tone as shaw's goes beserk and ironically sings rule britannia and god save the queen as he crashes his car into things the political point is heavily over egged by this bombastic rather operatic ending all sense of subtlety so effectively conveyed hitherto is lost as the implicit point is heavily and noisily made prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama br br overall however one cannot be too harsh while this absurd end piece is a major flaw the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive evocative film of sadness and detailed observation about the way british society was in the past hartley's languid but crystal clear touch is very much in evidence throughout it's just a shame that we don't end on the shattering conclusion to shaw's drunk scene the tragic deluded figure of sarah miles' lady franklin is abruptly denied her place at the epicenter of the film as the excellent human drama bizarrely slips into the realms of political point scoring shaw also that most dry and yet deeply feeling of actors is betrayed by the out of character excess that closes the film thus a fine small scale triumph is sabotaged but we ought to remember the many good points br br rating 1 2
<START> this movie is important to those of us interested in western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production br br the scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic so far as i know it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating the techniques for river crossings at a bluff the horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and the scene is such that i could watch it over and again just trying to get a feel for what a crossing was like and the early travelers did it time and time again while crossing the country br br melodrama aside this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone
<START> speed which i believe is direct copy of the hollywood movie cellular i haven't watched this one gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days but then gets in a very boring draw at the end i have watched this movie today on 12th january 2008 on rented vcd it's release date is 19th oct 2007 but still fortunately for me i didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office so in this situation when i watch the movie i feel that this movie could have been a very good movie but then the director again falls in the trap for bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance br br off course as a bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else but now days it doesn't matter for me if i haven't seen the original movie i just found the main theme much similar to of time' and in the movie sanjay suri is shown an intelligence agent but his wife thinks that he is a chef this brings back the memory of 'true lies' the only new part was the use if the phone but that too i found out now is taken from movie cellular so when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear br br the things i like about the movie is its pace as the name suggest the things really happens fast and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes but this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional bollywood style of br br the plot of the movie is also quite interesting three stories going parallel one after the other one of the kidnapping of urmila the other of the trying to help urmila and then the plan of murder of prime minister these three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues br br but then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie except sanjay suri none other makes any impression this goes even for urmila who is always promising in movies due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted e g the scene at the end where urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone should have made a good impact but instead we just wait for the end of that scene br br other than acting some unnecessary love for style the movie showing so cool villains is good for hollywood movies not for bollywood the background of london is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen especially at the end all those were utterly unnecessary may be director has an impression that the climax in hindi movies must have such fights they look unrealistic increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends br br over and all i find the movie once watchable if it is coming on tv or you can get it on rent its ok but then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy next time when the movie is on tv you can safely watch other channels
<START> i have seen most of john waters' films with the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available i have actually seen just about all of them so it's obvious i am a big fan and it's certain that i have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films while way over the top and disgusting i adored female trouble and polyester two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films so i am certainly not squeamish and can take most of what waters has to offer however in pink flamingos he has created a film so repellent so unfunny and so offensive that i couldn't even stand it in his other films he made before he became more mainstream they were funny yet here the humor just isn't there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way i am glad that after making this film waters' sense of humor improved as divine consuming dog feces as in this film is shocking but not the least bit entertaining my advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s
<START> the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john woo's masterful direction coupled with kat's superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate is particularly good as the baddest of the bad it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache i didn't even recognize him at first sammo's goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent
<START> another awful movie about hockey i if never watched hockey and saw hollywoods version i would hate the game this movie doesn't make canada look that great either i can laugh at it and not take it too seriously all the same this movie is awful with every thing you can put in a 80's movie in the end don't even watch it on tv 4 10
<START> this film reeks of production line planning it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies and threw spaghetti on the screen jimmy stewart june allyson anthony mann baseball war baby airplane roll 'em the film does address the age of the stewart allyson performers though i'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger br br there are messages in strategic air command i found curiously shocking and offensive but i'll stick with one truly wretched element the happily married couple is challenged when mr stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife in the film's most dramatic scene she calls him on it it ends completely unresolved allyson is crying her heart out on their bed and stewart walks out on her no discussion he simply says he is correct and walks out on his devastated wife for all he knows she could slit her wrists br br later allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision br br unbelievable br br stick with stewart allyson in the stratton story 1949 br br strategic air command 3 25 55 anthony mann james stewart june allyson frank lovejoy
