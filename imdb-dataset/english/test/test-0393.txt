<START> catch that girl is really great movie it's a 'happy' movie i watched this movie in international fantastic film festival ' on july 2003 there is action adventure comedy thrill happy romance cute kids' love triangle you must see this movie
<START> i don't care what some of the reviews said this movie was funny the thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained this is not some intellectual comedy this is a clever popcorn movie the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself a former tv cop brought in by russo's character to coach the cops on how to be tv cops those are by far the funniest scenes if you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh then watch this movie
<START> i work at a nuclear power plant so i am getting a kick out of these replies br br seriously i do go to http en wikipedia org wiki palisades nuclear generating station and you can see where i work br br i could not think of a safer industry to work in we are required by procedures to report events as minor as paper cuts any issue identified as being a potential concern with respect to nuclear or industrial safety is immediately reported in the action process br br bottom line is that nuclear plants in the us operate with safety in the front of their mind
<START> superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to mary webb's period novel this film is a true masterpiece aside from the exceptionally talented rising star janet mcteer as the lead and one or two established actors the film used mostly little known names yet the drama was all the more convincing for that the social and personal tension is almost tangible and i felt as if the cast were reacting each other's character as though they would have done in real life i saw that one commentator asked if janet mcteer really had a hare lip a testimony to just how good was her characterisation i saw this on tv when it was first shown taped it then later the tape was sadly lost but it remains clear as anything in my mind if you have any fondness at all for the social period it's an absolute must see
<START> i have to confess i fell into the cynical trap of believing that australians couldn't make drama unless it meant a lot of crying and i am an australian sad isn't it while this movie does involve crying its not dramatic crying its honest emotion shining through br br also this film is a whodunnit i knew what the final outcome was going to be when i started watching this so i tried to guess who it was that was going to do it i missed by a mile br br i was stunned when i found out the director was only around 21 when he made this film i would love to shake his hand he knows how to make a movie i hope he has more coming br br all of the characters we meet before the main title credit about 12 minutes in is an anti hero all of them troubled in their own way and all of them as selfish as the next one even when they are sympathetic br br the saddest scene in the movie and there are some that are difficult to watch is the final scene where we're formally introduced to the real main character and we're told of their nephew that scene made me cry br br my faith in australian drama has been restored we're masters at comedy but i was getting bored with comedy br br if you happen to check this out you touched my soul and for that i can only thank you
<START> i saw this series in 1999 in london tv and was blown away like another user commented this is what i would have liked to see when i first watched jurassic park life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary the cg are very lifelike and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational br br the series takes everything factually known about dinosaurs adds a lot of good ideas on what it could have been to make up what then looks like a documentary series what i missed was some small bar graph constantly in one corner of the screen moving between fiction and fact along with the narration and the pictures because you often wonder how much is educated guessing and how much is pure fantasy br br to some clues on facts fiction you have to see the 50 minute making of which is not only very educational about the cg process and collecting and including the paleontologists knowledge into the series but which also is very funny dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about cg animators br br i highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming disney dinosaur movie or watching any jurassic park like movie again it will surely make you much more critical towards those movies the disney trailers looked especially bad
<START> easily one of the best shows ever made it just gets better with age br br for me one of the chief reasons for this was the english adaptation done by david weir br br a japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in it's original language was more whimsical less flat out hilarious that the version we all know br br the fact that the show resonates so strongly for its non japanese fans is i think largely because of mr weir's inspired efforts some winning voice over work br br well done sir
<START> what a shame that some good talent was wasted this is a tedious and overly self conscious movie that could tell its story in half the time is that derek jacobi under that beard doing two roles gosh who would have guessed br br the emotional payoff a the end was weak and unsatisfying certainly not worth enduring the padded length of the movie for i felt quite let down br br the sound was dreadful first they used stock music second it was so loud during some of the dialog that the words were hard to make out only three sound crew and a trainee there were more people listed in the credits for either the accounting or the legal br br some of the camera work was quite good though and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script br br not a good use of viewing time at least for me
<START> drab dreary and a total waste of my time the plot is incomprehensible so don't think about it too much the acting is odd and wooden i would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting but that might be an insult to body builders there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster but lots of fires explosions a gratuitous sex scene etc the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclear hmmm is roger corman psychic let's hope that iraq was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn't come true br br
<START> so you're a giant mantis and you've been hanging out in the arctic for a while and you're tired of eskimos hitting you with snowballs what's a giant mutant insect to do head for the big city of course see the sights maybe catch a show on broadway but wait just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own some pesky humans start attacking you argh time to smash br br anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies because it has pretty decent fx for 1957 but that's about it avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things or see another perry mason actor in a b movie br br 4 10

<START> what do you mean son of actor not an actor you don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar it doesn't work that way not in uk at any rate br br macbeth this version is a low budget scottish movie you can't compare this to the polanski version because polanski has all the budgets in the world br br jason acted throughout school but his big break came in 1985 when he landed the role of robin hood in britain's robin of sherwood television series he has appeared in many films since then including shanghai noon and lord of the rings jason has since moved behind the camera forming the production company unconditional entertainment he recently wrapped filming on his latest movie which stars cuba gooding jr and ray winstone br br and all this has nothing to do with being the son of sean connery if you think jason said to sean daddy i wanna be in macbeth movie that they are going to film and sean said sure son whatever you say and made a phone call and got his son the role you are mistaken in fact jason connery is being cut out of his father's will seeing as how his father is sean connery that's a big chunk of change jason will be losing out on the reasoning behind the decision is apparently sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself the relationship has become fairly strained with jason even threatening to change his name br br of being the son of sean connery br br i realize that i'm always going to be compared to my father there are innuendos all the time should i spend my whole life justifying myself br br so stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of sean connery big deal br br watch jason in bullet to beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability

<START> an interesting pairing of stories this little flick manages to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of wwii and succeeds in tying them together without losing the audience i was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much i really felt i understood them and their motivations even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited the outstanding acting abilities of the individuals involved with this picture are easily noted a fun stylized movie with a slew of comic moments and a bunch more head shaking events br br 7 10
<START> for a moment let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope if each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept they found each other and they fell in love that this love was against all the social religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant they loved each other found relief in each other that was sufficient the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life very nice
