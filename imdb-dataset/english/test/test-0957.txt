<START> in the wake of my personal research into the pending end cycle time of 2012 presented by the mayan calendar system i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as what the bleep do we know while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level speak the elegant universe breaks such barriers the visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics there are numerous messages in this movie the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what's being taught true pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of established science
<START> many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting casting and styling of this film it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question euthanasia br br this film is bar the final scenes meticulous in stressing ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that for him a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living we as viewers see an enormous amount of dignity in his life we see family and friends and culture and but for its physical limitations a life fully lived central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that ramon's life is not worth living and that is him br br to watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense the priest's visit is pure farce a direct assault on the simplicity of the spanish catholic church's response to the issue of euthanasia however the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film we are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love as the film progresses we may gradually be encouraged to understand ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision br br i do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this
<START> scott's collection of 80's icons cannot save this teen disaster but then i suppose that's why it was only a tv movie and not a major motion picture william a schwartz writer comes up with something closer to stewardess school except this movie is more boring this movie isn't really stupid just boring and completely plotless the only reason to see this might be to see tina in an actual role after family ties after this movie and equally dumb class cruise i guess mr scott wised up and went back to directing sit coms which was his best move yet 4 out of 10
<START> although i was hoping that i'd like it a little more this was still certainly an impressive film there were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what i'd call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested for me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well i also thought that the low budget suited this movie for i don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim all things considered it fell a little short of my expectations but i'm still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie
<START> michael sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius if you are familiar with kenneth williams' mannerisms and diaries then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly when i read about kenneth in his swimming trunks i laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen but this time i didn't laugh as it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man it must have been such a lonely existence being in skin craving attention but shunning it when it truly mattered the last 20 minutes are heart breaking as you see kenneth gradually sink to the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative i have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he bids goodnight to louie i cannot recommend this drama enough sexually explicit but it drives home the fact that kenneth couldn't let anyone invade his world and this is where the sadness of the man lies for a genius who brought happiness to so many it's such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness pauly
<START> strangers on a train was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing i finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far surpassed most thrillers being made today you can see the inspiration for future action movies here the climactic ending with the out of control merry go round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de bont's speed of course strangers is over forty years older than speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there hitchcock was a true genius br br the not so subtle gay side of bruno robert walker in an amazing performance has taken form in many other psycho stalker figures in future movies consider him a male version of jennifer jason leigh in single white female he knows about guy before he even meets him on the train we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental and is soon entirely obsessed with him br br hitchcock loved the elements in his movies also see psycho for more blatant undertones and there's a lot of that here bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother his effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non masculine robe flirting with guy and responding to his mother br br the deep layers of this movie make it a fast paced thriller than you can return to again and again unfortunately it's being remade as a big budget hollywood production but after seeing the original i honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white knuckle thrills of this movie
<START> ed wood perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are so bad they delight being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent br br james lay and his financial backers mom and dad it seems from the credits have created in a film just as poorly made as any ed wood film but lacking any charm or innocence dreamland simply stinks and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that james lay and his fellow perps will never make another picture again br br i must mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture i'm sure the production controller once seeing the completed film demanded to have his or her name changed in the credits to and the accounting done by one can imagine with his roll of 5 dollar bills paying the crew at the end of a shooting day br br i wont mention the many technical problems with this pathetic little videotape but i must mention a few commentaries that compare this slag to the work of david lynch you know you have turned out a real stinker when you have your mom log into imdb and post such astonishing bs no one save violent mental patients could ever mistake with anything produced by lynch what a horrific slight against mr lynch and his work br br go back to film school mr lay
<START> this is an extraordinary topical thriller fonda and douglas are good but lemmon blows them away he plays a man who must go against everything he thought was right bridges paces the film very well with a lot of tension the last of the seventies expose films
<START> at first sight i must say already watch the contractor 2007 with wesley snipes too a better action movie and with a more dramatic plot br br the detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb set in romania and with awful directing for an action movie there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom br br really what you expect wesley snipes to do when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him don't blame him he needs the money br br this was the first impression when i saw the movie 3 years ago but i won't see it again no way screw it it sucks there i said it br br ps i don't think i ever said this movie sucks on a imdb review thank you detonator
<START> in sweet water the ambitious entrepreneur dick krantz jim storm is constructing a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the when three workers find some indian relics and bones in a ditch in the site they accidentally release the giant skeleton like creature known as bone eater and their bones are devoured by the monster the half breed sheriff steve evans bruce a k a running wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers being pressed by krantz to arrest the protesters but the bone eater attacks and kills other locals while chief storm cloud michael horse seeks an ancient capable of destroying the evil creature br br bone eater is a lame and silly movie with one of the most ridiculous screenplay i have ever seen the characters and situation are not well developed and things happen without any further consequences the conclusion is probably the worse part in this flick with the typical white north american bruce dressed like an indian in the story his grandfather was an indian cutting his own wrist why and where is the blood later and clumsily throwing the axe in the chest of the bone eater destroying the monster and my last hope of any improvement in the story my last question if the bone eater eats bones what happens to the flesh and clothes of his victims my vote is three br br title brazil o de the bone eater
<START> i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief i was even more shocked to see people the film in the comments section of this site this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever the people behind this should be bought to justice asap today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing nauseating indeed
<START> this is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale all the characters are great and the story was awesome plus i thought the ending was really cool the plot was great and it never bored me plus while the child actors were bad they gave me the creeps this happened to be on the space channel a while ago so i decided to check it out and tape it i read some good reviews from fellow horror fans i must say i agree with them it's very creepy and suspenseful plus martin was fantastic in his role as the satan worshiper it has tons of creepy atmosphere and it keeps you guessing throughout plus all the characters were very likable and you really start to root for ben and his family it has plenty of disturbing moments and the film really shocked me at times plus it's extremely well made on a low budget this is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale i highly recommend this one the direction is very good bernard does a very good job here with great camera work creating a lot of creepy atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace ther is a little bit of blood and gore we get a severed leg lots of bloody corpses bloody slit throat slicing and dicing decapitation and an impaling the acting is excellent martin is fantastic here as the satan worshiper he is extremely creepy very convincing was quite chilling was extremely intense seemed to be enjoying himself and just did a fantastic job overall charles bateman is great as the dad he was very caring very likable and gave a good show i liked him lots l q jones is awesome as the sheriff he was funny on top of things looked very young had a cool character and just did an awesome job overall capri is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do pretty well charles robinson overacted to the extreme as the priest and didn't convince me one bit and that laugh of his was especially bad is actually decent as the daughter she was somewhat likable and only got on my nerves a couple times i rather liked her moore was goofy but very likable in his role as tobey i dug him rest of the cast do good overall i highly recommend it 1 2 out of 5
<START> visconti's masterpiece i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of his work but i cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film last night i watched death in venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw this was a pastiche composed of many elements the extraordinary shots directed by primarily his love of long languorous shots of people dining swimming walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of visconti's shot selection the acting by the principles without over riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone br br it is true young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film a film that could not be made in 2006 a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money men took secondary roles as many of the recent imdb commentator's have written this film in their judgment is long boring too little action and pretentious i suppose by the standards of hollywood pap these comments contain merit unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years br br please if you have not seen death in venice rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time you will be rewarded
<START> first i should say that i've seen the '39 version at least 100 times know all the dialog and have read the play which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own this version is as flat as a lifetime movie on adultery there's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of tv ads for it according to entertainment weekly bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other guess what that was booth's intent it was a slick theatrical take on gossip adultery and back biting among a set of well heeled manhattan socialites the crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material they pick at it weirdly putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version bette midler who is in just a few scenes and acts the old countess part in a broad grinning style doesn't have any context in this version she mentions going after buck which is a key element in the original then he's never mentioned again this movie is so dull that i'm not going to over analyze it but here are a few things that i found unbelievable mary haines bragging to her domestic staff i can suck the nails out of a board right great writing norma shearer could've done a line reading on that gotten an oscar nom right a compassionate sylvia fowler annette bening got what she wanted and the movie just sort of withers away claire booth used sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play as portrayed immortally by rosalind russell she was an ignorant spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty ridiculous irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable she wasn't above biting godard's ankle the 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die in killing her off they killed the movie
<START> if i could have given this film 0 10 i would and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low its worse than awful if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it at least minimum wage some of the camera shots were quite effective but a lot were rubbish eg villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side ways from his body seeing is believing several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions facial expressions when they were shot i only watched it to the end fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat but there was almost none of that should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music end of 'action' scene in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact the chief villain keeps coming back to life he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd 3rd floor onto the street to sum up this film is a total waste of time and a total joke it looks very low budget even for seagal the colour is dull and grey i could go on and on just like this film but i wont watch this film if you've got insomnia its guaranteed to put you to sleep
