<START> johnny knoxville and the boys of jackass go over the top for jackass number two at a press screening the laughter was so loud and raucous it was hard to hear all the dialog the stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before br br all of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film and they succeeded if you like this genre you'll love this film if not don't bother br br some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves and they have no regard for what happens to them they'll do anything to make a stunt work br br many critics panned johnny knoxville for a less active role in the first film but not to worry he is front and center in number two and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a number br br this is a must see for fans of this type of humor br br chris entertainment editor fort bend herald
<START> please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as i did the fact that i did is not a very good reflection on me the only redeeming acting job in this clunker was by wes studi how a with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as lonesome dove is beyond me it was a disjointed rambling incoherent story plot lines were not developed action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending disappointment was a fitting ending to this mini series val kilmer who i have thought as a reputable actor played one of the strangest roles that i have ever seen him in his final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director i have been reading these reviews for years and this show prompted me to sign up
<START> i wanted to see this movie ever since the previews came out i don't understand why everyone is so hard on this film it may not all be technically true to the sport of rugby but this film is not mainly about the sport it's about a rugby team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them they are taught to become men and not temporally vain boys hollywood is never 100 correct in their productions they are there to make a product that sells something entertaining the story of coach and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing he teaches about service honor integrity and moral cleanliness how many other movies are teaching that to our youth these days i was proud to see such an amazing story that taught reverence and respect
<START> this movie isn't worth going to the theaters to watch i did and i didn't like it the effects on the movie are really well done and you get a laugh here and there but the story is really bad it seemed like they had run out of ideas and what is that of loki and odin getting along that totally destroys norse mythology and i guess they forgot that powers only worked during the night if you really must see this movie rent it when it comes out don't go to the movies for this br br they could have done a lot more with this than they did it felt like they just wanted to do a movie to show off cool animation and effects
<START> i love movies that take you into them a movie that actually leaves you feeling weak when its over and this kind of movie is rare br br damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen this movie has a cutting edge to it a main stream cast for such a low budget why is it that a man with this much talent and charisma not to mention sex appeal in ways beyond most other actors can do this with so little money to work with these actors really believe in his script and raw talent as a director writer and actor i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him damian i have heard of you through so many different circles and do not let the jealous people of this world get to you martin gets this fellini got it and you will always get it the fire and passion in you is what we love to watch on screen thankyou for being different and having the guts to write like you do you are a one of a kind director do not listen to the empty vessels
<START> this is a below average whodunit with the cliche everyone in the living room routine charlie chan is a secret service agent doing government work and he must find who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat german u boats in world war two there is little to recommend with this movie since the neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot charlie chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing who who cares
<START> down periscope is not a great movie but then again very few flicks are so if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a great movie without the capitals no sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine they are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star they must take on the entire us navy with it's nuclear submarines but they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome but you root for those underdogs and this makes it a very entertaining movie watch and enjoy eight stars that is
<START> a feminist tract in which if you the viewer believe that i wild animals are seldom tamed by singing but instead attack kill and eat the line that never attack unless provoked was a hoot unless provoked means that it sees flesh ii homosexuality is both immoral per se and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a society's dissolution and decay iii few women are bisexual in this one virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women iv divorce is far worse than infidelity v land is there for human beings to use develop and enjoy vi it is as incumbent upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son vii a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii the of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior no matter their age and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships marriage believe me you are not going to like this film essentially it's a howard stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a jane fonda sort of woman think the electric horseman it's ugly stuff because the values the ideals of the screenplay are all so harmful br br i share the other objections about the odd things in the writing a why would this man lose every girlfriend he has because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them it's a mystery why he just keeps saying it was personal when faced with angry and disappointed women huh br br b there's an enormous inconsistency i e the screenwriter wants to have it both ways by telling us that the protagonist's mother loved the father with everything she had and then later we're told that there was only one great love in her life her lesbian girlfriend br br c the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense we're never told that the has any right to live at the property merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole title and right to occupy the property yet somehow the film makes it appear that the is the rightful occupant which is crazy try to think of any of any will who uses the property before the will's are fulfilled it doesn't happen br br d the assumption throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women it's just absurd thus we're told i that penelope ann miller's character is dating other men near the end of the film after having been with the for five years and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist ii that the protagonist's housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband is now dating another woman iii that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore like to try a woman br br iv that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v that mary kay place's character naturally looked at other women in college and they looked back she says with an idiotic flip of the head br br this is all just ridiculous br br i agree with others about the sound of the dvd i had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names phrases br br this is a film by someone who really despises traditional heroics by any man hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child loathes the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex the film is out to preach and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesn't sit well
<START> combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script not to mention albert brooks' excellent character portrayal but man of the year can't come close by comparison it has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable br br the premise initially seemed very promising put a jon stewart like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens this independent runner is tom dobbs robin williams rv a successful tv personality who is pressured into running by his audience along with him comes his manager jack christopher walken click and his writer eddie lewis black seeming to have very little chance at a successful run tom dobbs amazingly wins the election br br but did he eleanor green laura linney the exorcist of emily rose is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at stations she finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney alan jeff goldblum independence day poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out the company's evil men decided to discredit and or kill eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone but eleanor is able to get to president elect dobbs and finally spill the beans this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming too dobbs goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world thus removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company oh and saving ms green's life br br does any of this sound funny the comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward robin williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him br br the message of the film is interesting and debatable too that special interest owns presidential candidates i'm sure there's substantial truth in this and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could if you wanted to make a comedy about you could but man of the year isn't it
<START> this film has made e mad i believe the original of this film 'the mask' was an awesome film worth buying and watching a lot i strongly believed that they should make a sequel but when i saw this i thought again br br this film has spoilt the whole idea of 'the mask' mask mode a baby flying around in a room my little brother who is seven didn't even laugh and he is into these childish movies but this was worse a load of crap i am telling you now please do not watch this film it is a waste of money and a waste of time instead you could actually be having fun watch 'the mask' but do not i repeat do not watch this hunk of junk thank you
<START> this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at is a classic b br br goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it's the script stupid br br this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre br br is it an unmitigated disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it's been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it's in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and creatively bankrupt and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess br br if you loved there's something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don't bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead
<START> when the trailer for accepted first came up many people began to get excited about seeing it really excited who could blame them it looked like fun but that's exactly the thing people went into accepted looking for a good movie but if you think about it accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie it's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given that being said for those of you who expected a great film you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one think that and you will truly enjoy the film because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic bottom line watch the movie and have fun but don't look for anything groundbreaking
<START> this movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind a age story of love and grit the depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love and hate with some very interesting twists this is a must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences but for all viewers i can't say much more or i will spoil the experience for a new young audience who might just be coming out another fine work for sarah waters it also is a great way for sally hawkins to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another sarah waters work in tipping the velvet it is also a must see
<START> i normally wouldn't waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this however i'm off of work this week so i have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities to start let me say that i frequently enjoy non commercial non mainstream non american cinema feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography that said there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the u s trust me i've been tortured by hundreds of them lost in beijing is one particularly bad film br br the opening half hour is an impressive non stop exhibition of moral degeneracy this film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as kim ki duk's bad guy 2001 br br 1 women actually enjoy being raped 2 rape should be glorified praised and respected 3 feel free to rape any woman you like because while your doing her she'll eventually start to like it and reach orgasm 4 if you're wife gets raped make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money but if he doesn't pay just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation 5 if you're wife gets raped be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist taunting her with lines like did he fu k you like this 6 if you're husband is a rapist just accept it 7 after you personally get raped befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible br br how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters they're nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other don't misunderstand me though i'm very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own ichi the killer 2001 and moonlight whispers 1999 are very interesting portrayals of sado masochism strange circus 2005 is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse marriage is a crazy thing 2002 is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage even religiously based movies like running on karma 2003 and 2001 have entertained me on occasion the difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them whereas lost in beijing has virtually none br br it's known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior why exactly does bing bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally the filmmakers never bothered to tell us even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy it all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides br br other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization the reason you can't choose which person to root for is because they weren't developed properly don't think that this movie has complex characters just because they're not clearly defined on the contrary the reason they're not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they're thinking this is hardly a positive attribute of this movie br br on the positive side the camera work and acting are quite good but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses you can place this alongside trash like turning gate 2002 what time is it there 2001 irreversible 2002 and the aforementioned bad guy
<START> now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second choice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing i highly recommend this film although it's low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but there's something for the men here too
