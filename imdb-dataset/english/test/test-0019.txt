<START> another great performance by kiefer sutherland i love his movies because he always plays his role very well for a low budget film this was done very good and kept me on the edge the whole time i love these type of movies and i was glad i caught it on i'll be buying the dvd or tape for sure br br 9 10
<START> even mst3k couldn't make this painful long and ultimately mind bending drek funny or entertaining while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense br br the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first half hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlights br br the hero of the film ator is no more than eye candy for this literal energy sucker of a film dressed in a loin cloth and sporting pecs like melons as joel put it he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here br br i would recommend this only to die hard and i mean die hard followers of cheese if you have an enemy recommend them this film if you make it through this i commend you you should be able to make it through anything
<START> many consider beast stable to be the last of the true female prisoner films as it is the last of the series directed by ito and is followed by one other film grudge song by a different director i have not seen grudge song yet but soon will so i don't know how it stacks up to the previous fp films but it will be interesting to see the way beast stable ended didn't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor but i guess i'll find out br br this entry has scorpion on the run from the cops where she hooks up with a street hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child oh yeah that's no lie gotta love these sleazy story lines scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival but as she is so good at ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends br br i agree with some other reviewers that this one is a little slower at points and more serious then the previous two entries the story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times but a lot of these 70's era pinky films are and i still love them beast stable is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing but i thought it strong in other areas storyline cinematography some good sleaze etc definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing or who have enjoyed the other female prisoner films 8 10
<START> there is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction i guess it is the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction the falcon and the snowman tells the true story about christopher boyce and his buddy lee boyce hutton is a former alter boy and intellectual trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him his fbi father is able to pull some strings and get his idealist son a job working in the defense department boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and goofing around with his co workers however as time goes on boyce starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government the idealist boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the cia is carrying out in above all places australia boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the top secret info he is privy to to the kgb of course mistake is the assumption that because the usa is doing bad things the ussr is the good guy over time boyce and his drug dealing buddy lee penn start to sell their top secret information to the kgb what was once idealism turns into capitalism and espionage the strength of this movie is the incredible performances by hutton and penn although one of them starts off with the best intentions they will both soon find themselves in an unending downward spiral great direction music everything not only a great film but one of my all time favorites
<START> while many pass this off as a b movie it is indeed a first class comedy that is well written and acted red skelton is great as wally benton better known to radio fans as the fox ann rutherford is perfect as wally's fiance carol lambert conrad veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals i read one account of this movie which states that vincente minelli directed this film not unless he changed his name to s sylvan simon who directed all three of the fox movies this is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged so get over your black and white prejudice if you have one sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy this was also red's first starring role take note during the climax of the reference to orson welles' war of the worlds broadcast
<START> is a long film for its genre and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by western audiences that being said i enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains some of the scenery is truly breathtaking and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive with minimal use of the fast forward br br
<START> oh gosh i'm really fed up with all these generic japanese horror films about long haired female ghosts and ghostly kids ghost train is no exception it is clearly influenced by ringu ju on shutter and pulse two years ago i was into such modern ghost stories because they usually managed to give me some goosebumps unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in ghost train in fact the film is really boring noriko goes missing in a subway tunnel like an elementary school classmate nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances with the help of a youthful train conductor and another disappeared child's mother the film offers some mildly creepy moments however the cgi effects are laughable and the climax is illogical skip it
<START> excellent performances and a solid but not overplayed story helped this movie exceed my expectations this movie was far better than i was expecting after some of the reviews i had read but frankly those reviewers just got it wrong very inspiring and uplifting highly recommended
<START> dictated by thin experience of both life and industry and no cash sofia coppola's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus the cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b w it's difficult to tell the characters apart the sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance br br yet there are one or two things to note the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close up shots the editing to music also creates an interest and momentum without descent into the netherworld of the music video coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film the dramatic turn is cut fast and to the point and the second act is almost non existent we recognise it's actually been played out in tandem with the first which is the point of the narrator on crutches trope who is an otherwise curiously appended character in that first act br br despite these notes it's an awkward short 2 10
<START> this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually it's really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere br br the story is not only paper thin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesn't bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when there's a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the story br br there's no sense of entrapment or ever present danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again there's nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else that's better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesn't br br the story doesn't go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killer's actions but there's no indication that they're connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutes br br in the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killer's previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in 1971 so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explaining br br next a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about what's been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killer's lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over br br the cop quickly starts telling nicole that he's a goner who's lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesn't die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the all important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shock br br nicole finally confronts the fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking he's been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of 10 seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wow br br this movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality direct to dvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality it's just more clichÃ© b movie garbage
<START> this is a terrible film angie dickenson is a class act and always does well but she does not get many roles any more and she must have needed some money to do this film by the way she is on screen less than 10 minutes oooh wait there is one redeeming feature in this film meg foster has a small part in this film now meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly great but she has the scariest eyes of any actress i have ever seen by name you probably don't know her but one look at her eyes and you will recognize her to summarize the acting is horrid the story bad and even the filmography is dreadful a screen going to black every time the director wants to change scenes is pretty moronic watch any thing else but this even mr ed reruns
<START> this is another universal fun filled fright fest many people want to compare it to house of frankenstein even though it has similar cast and the same director it can stand on its own it does appear that c directed most of the universal horror films of the 40's br br the plot recap baron appears at the home of dr seeking a cure for his vampirism larry talbot who somehow survived house of frankenstein also shows up at the good doctors door seeking a cure for his affliction after a failed suicide attempt talbot and the doctor find the frankenstein monster to complicate matters just before he bites the dust dracula infects the good doctor with his blood the doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times where this leads to is something you'll have to see for your self br br carradine actually gives a very good performance as dracula he isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles it is hard to repress giggles when he appears in a top hat though the cape cloak is traditional but the hat has to go where does the hat go when he changes into a bat br br onslow stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor he's torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood lust he is now prone to this is a very underrated performance chaney brings even more life to the wolf man in his 4th appearance in that role br br the monster isn't given much to do this time just lay on the table until the end some stock footage from the ghost of frankenstein is used at least in house of frankenstein he was up and around a bit br br yes this does stick to the basic universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running amok with torches but it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes it gets a low 8
<START> well at least we have to acknowledge the big hollywood horror producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in america they now discovered they could simply hire the asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states that's like killing two birds with one stone way to go guys the is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the oriental countries ever since ringu roughly translated this means it's a boring overlong and entirely gore free film but it does feature copious amounts of false scares and embarrassingly weak did we scare you yet moments the pang brothers danny oxide previously made the extremely overrated the eye and it sort of is a tradition for them to build up a story with clues and hints towards a point where it becomes nearly impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audiences yet they don't seem eager to alter their formula any time soon and they're also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old repetitive ghost topics over and over again restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm the protagonist family torn apart by unprocessed traumas from the past so they first have to restore faith and trust in each other give me a break throw in a videotape and a seven days curse why don't you even the attempts to make you jump in your seat are too dÃ©jÃ  vu and won't scare anyone over the age of 7 slamming doors filthy gradually larger growing stains on the walls ghostly appearances noises coming from the cellar the endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans the revolves on a family on their way to a new life in the country as the growers of the family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy which doesn't get revealed until late in the film caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents to distrust their revolting teenage daughter soon after the children experience strange presences in remote farmhouse but they don't manage to convince their parents to leave that's pretty much concludes the entire film little ben sees things but he can't talk and jessica repeatedly gets attacked by supernatural forces but nobody listens to her the basic premise of the is very derivative of stanley kubrick's immortal classic the shining only it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone the script takes itself far too seriously even though it's fairly easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable at least the eye delivered some genuine shocks in the end whereas the happy happy joy joy ending of the is just pathetic the only positive elements i can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations the adequate editing job and the promising young acting talents and beauty kristen stewart and there's an uncanny but sadly underdeveloped supportive role for william b davis
<START> barely three and a half years after just scraping out a month's run 7 31 oct 1953 at broadway's theatre on west 49th street since renamed the o'neill mgm relied on the earlier solid london success of the play to lavish a wonderful cast and for the most part carefully opened up production on a sadly trimmed down screenplay of this slyly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest hit br br ava gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of stewart granger an internationally successful and entirely complacent workaholic before the term had been coined using the perpetually frustrated david niven to attempt to rekindle passion in her spouse when the second honeymoon cruise gardner granger into leaves the trio and granger's dog marooned on a south sea island were there other survivors that's for later plot developments granger continues right on managing the world around him building a big hut for himself and his wife and a little one of the title for niven or the unattached male br br the core of the actual plot of the play only gets going about half way through the film when niven proposes that granger and he alternate as tenants of the little hut sharing the only female on the island as granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes his br br reason which granger considers his strong point reigns and frustration reigns supreme for a while br br david niven and ava gardner are superb in their appointed roles of suave would be seducer and seductress and stuart granger usually called upon merely to be handsome and virile in action roles and the odd miscast specialty a pretty boy as in shaw's caesar and cleopatra in 1945 gives one of the better acting performances of his film career as the husband who may actually be as smart as he thinks he is 33 years later he would again show this suave opposite rex harrison in granger's first and both their last broadway engagements in a hit revival of somerset maugham's the circle which only ended with harrison's death we'd be far richer if granger had used these skills more often br br as promising as the menage is this is after all a very british boulevard comedy and hollywood in the 1950's which is to say that unlike the source play very little sex actually goes on to be frank if you don't give yourself over to the ideas driving the contrivances it does get a bit silly the same basic plot is far more satisfyingly developed three years later in the cary grant deborah kerr robert mitchum jean simmons stewart granger's actual wife the grass is greener based on an even less successful play but for some reason that superior trifle failed at the box office br br as lavishly as mgm set the piece there were unfortunate lapses the silliness which ends the stay on the island is cartoonishly presaged in what should have been a moment of genuine excitement the sinking of the yacht that puts them on the island ultimately we only get about three quarters of an hour of the real little hut but ninety good minutes of david niven ava gardner and stewart granger that make the film a fun diversion not high culture but a worthy guilty pleasure br br we even get some very nice in walter reputed to be actual lover at the time as one of his better speeches goes
<START> it's exactly what the title tells you an island inhabited by shipwrecked doctor claudio cassinelli and crew land on the island they're either picked off by the or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson cassinelli discovers that johnson who believes he's found the lost city of atlantis has been keeping disgraced scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea cotten of course is a complete madman bach and cassinelli have great chemistry this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not surprisingly without merit it's fast paced reasonably well acted and the look pretty convincing though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things don't look like actual there's an excellent music score by luciano
