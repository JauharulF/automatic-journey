<START> as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old i adore aristocats it is a movie that contains no double entendres no almost swear words like heck or darn no parents who are functional idiots and no crotch smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the best kids movies these days the story line is sweet and interesting the music is great the love story is quite romantic the kittens are adorable and the various other characters are unique and attention capturing the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing the characters are quite well cast as well i love listening to eva velvety voice and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well it's really a movie about love tolerance good manners and faithfulness who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values it is a movie that i don't mind watching over and over unlike happy feet where i couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one
<START> when people harp on about how they don't make 'em like they used to then just point them towards this fantastically entertaining and quaint looking comedy horror from writer director glenn br br it's a tale of played by dominic monaghan and larry fessenden who end up digging up more than just silent immobile corpses after the initial shock of this they soon realise that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage and that's just what they try to do mind you it seems as if things may not have worked out quite as they planned as poor young arthur monaghan is actually relating his tale to a priest ron perlman before being taken to the gallows br br looking at the detail of his filmography seems to have taken the core of his first short movie and expanded it to this feature effort which is no bad thing fessenden returns and does well monaghan is one of those guys who can actually still get you to like him while he goes about the nefarious business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favourites such as perlman and angus scrimm on the scene this film is a lot of fun for genre fans br br it also benefits from a unique and favourable design and look at times moving from e c comic style panels into live action a la creepshow and always somehow feeling quite authentic in it's hammer horror feel maybe everything is just covered over with so much dry ice but that's beside the point whatever was done to capture everything on film it works it works well br br it may not have any actual scares but this film does have a great vein of black humour and definitely soaks every minute of it's runtime in macabre material that should please all of those who have the patience for horror that's a little bit more sedate and feels like it definitely could have been made back in the days of hammer br br see this if you like the flesh and the fiends the doctor and the devils creepshow
<START> this is an admirable attempt from first time filmmaker ham tran offering little glanced perspective dealing with vietnam war victims struggling for liberation but plays out as a glorified history special with clunky self consciously informative dialog and sub par acting even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not spring to life this sagging albeit historically worthy melodrama paying no mind to the often distracting disconnect with the actors to the reality of situations on screen and you should be left with an informative if somewhat impersonal educational lesson in vietnamese post war history
<START> i think this movie is the most misunderstood film in jerry lewis career it's little slow starting but after it gets going is very funny jerry's use of irony like never before in his earlier films ie who's minding the store the nutty professor etc the idea is clear it's a mock of the dirty dozen instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film you have 4 4 f's 2 tag alongs including the former l a dodgers all star willie davis as hilarious love that movie
<START> certainly expected more after seeing the cast list but wow br br i think a first time director could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran like john made it puzzles me to no end somehow the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of d list actors whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half the unknown actors were just plain awful less steve who does a decent job as axl the story is so bad that it really needs no mention the overall production value seems standard with some above average camera work if you can make it through the god awful slo mo scenes and the painful person on fire sequences i knew it would be dumb i just had no idea how dumb and unfortunately it's time spent that can never be returned to me i suppose if you enjoy really bad b films this might work for you but if you value any story at all this one is simply dreadful a complete waste of time
<START> this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen the part where they loose there daughter with the poltergeist overtone rip off just pushes it over the edge with stupidity i watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft core porn scenes in it i have to say it made me laugh my ass off the 80's 3d effects were very out of place included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex wow i wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest waist of time and money i have ever seen
<START> let me say from the outset i'm not a particular fan of this kind of film but holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective br br back in the old days the folks who inhabit would have been called zombies the undead and according to what clive barker has given us certain members of human kind in this craig sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world br br psychiatrist david cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the he tricks the police into killing sheffer but sheffer goes to a graveyard named cemetery where the congregate and live underground br br sheffer has also left a girl friend anne bobby who still has feelings for him even after he's been killed and is now one of the undead she tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind br br clive barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans but it's plain to see that if humans left them alone the in turn not bother with them br br your sympathies are definitely with the especially after seeing a fanatic like cronenberg and redneck police chief charles haid in action br br clive barker's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the is a metaphor for gay people i can see where that would come in especially since there are a whole lot of people who don't even think of gays as anything human because they're taught that way br br granted is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence but it also does make you think and i do like the way clive barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes craig sheffer a kind of messiah for the creatures
<START> it's a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen but when you see a noble actor like sir john gielgud surrounded by naked copulating couples that's just what you'll want to do add to that peter o'toole as syphilis ridden emperor and malcolm mcdowell sticking his finger up a male victim's anus and you begin to appreciate that caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sick outrageous films br br the film charts the life of notorious roman emperor caligula mcdowell a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters decapitations betrayals murders incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes br br although caligula was totally mad in real life and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not the film is still inexcusable filth the sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi layered story the sex is the story after a while all the nudity hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition the performances are totally undisciplined particularly mcdowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild eyed posturing o'toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves surely he's in it purely for the money rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post production but in truth there isn't a single minute in caligula that is dignified or well made it is doubtful that this amount of time talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again so in that sense caligula is a one of a kind experience on the other hand it's so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is one of a kind is a blessing in disguise
<START> this a wonderful sequel to the award winning lonesome dove miniseries in the 1980's this sequel is perhaps better than the original it is definitely more family friendly the language is more subdued there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with cherokee jack is particularly gruesome however overall a great movie the acting is superb william peterson is fantastic such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing jon voight aptly fills tommy lee jones' shoes as captain call ricky gives a great heart filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him highly recommended
<START> superbly crafted low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well br br the cast play it very well although richards' self centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times the tiny two scene cameo by sir alec guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow is simply the icing on the cake br br well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when you're all alone
<START> this is one of the best lesbian films i have ever seen this series brought joy and sadness of true love being set in the 1800's was an amazing look at lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women the cast was beyond expectation rachael stirling is an amazing actress i have never seen her other works but her portrayal of nan made me connect with her feeling her heartache and pains and love the one thing i feel most important is connecting with the characters in anything i watch if anyone has doubts on seeing this film think twice this is a must see series well done again to bbc we need more lesbian films that portrays real love and hurts like this one living in canada i had this dvd imported and i am so thrilled to have purchased it
<START> the good br br carrey is good actor and he proved it in man on the moon and in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but hey what can an actor do without good story and proper directing he can do number 23 br br the bad br br joel schumacher is poor overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie he made what he did with batman is just disaster but probably batman movies supposed to look good well they didn't instead of gothic and macabre we got disneyland sure falling down was great but can you ruin the film with robert duvall and michael douglas and with excellent script no you can't br br and so good actor and poor director finally met and made number 23 br br the ugly 23 br br i know that it's stupid to begin with but subplot almost half of this movie looks exactly like intro to another chapter of max voiceovers quality of detective story itself quality of the characters even colors mood and music editing and sound mix too perhaps it works for the game but surely it doesn't in the cinema br br mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny it's not even annoying carrey reads walking down the stairs in park why is it natural no but it looks good why suicide blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper if she just wanted to kill herself there is no logic in that but still it looks good guess what it it doesn't look good at all it looks unnatural instead br br all female characters are flat why is that so who cares let's go on with the story br br who is this private eye on the suicide hardly believable br br scenes when walter sparrow is arguing with his wife about weather book is really about him could be the best part of this movie instead we get scully routine disappointment br br interiors has no sign of people living in them except the significant objects shoes photos etc hard luck br br dialogs ain't that bad but what about v o well that's another story there's no such thing as destiny there are only different choices captain obvious to the rescue number was coming after and now it was coming after me clichÃ© and so on br br it's obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night successfully and undisturbed br br the subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard this is so old trick and so comfortable for writer and that it should have been banned i mean it br br flashbacks and editing similar to what happened in last episode of x files isn't the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie is it br br i wish i could say that this story deserves a better fate but it doesn't it makes no sense told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable all the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction this could be fun but since whole movie is dead serious it isn't to many coincidences is just bad for every story and the mystery it's predictable and easy to guess br br losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie but i never saw any of that in hollywood's productions if you're interested in the subject just watch repulsion by polanski or something by david cronenberg spider or a history of violence both of that movies deals with similar problems that number 23 wanted to show wanted but failed
<START> people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here the acting talent although not a list is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an a list cast my particular favourite from this movie is bridget fonda whose performance as the snow queen herself was quite moving assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup she injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from hollywood which i think is a good thing since hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on cgi and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger
<START> being a great fan of horror especially asian horror i have seen tons of movies but this one is outstanding why it does have a plot which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies the actors did a good job it feels like a real documentary film even if it's not it does not get boring for a moment the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult perhaps this cult never existed but still it's believable it reminded me of the similarly great movie forbidden siren br br to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character the psychic but this is subjective br br i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror br br 9 out of 10
<START> what a show lorenzo lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit by being a good cop then again he shows how sensitive a cop can be displaying a range of emotions like no other actor can except maybe himself in terminal justice br br huge enjoyment
