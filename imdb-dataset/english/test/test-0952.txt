<START> i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around first the good old scummy sleazy embassy vhs print called and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone's new favorite media company no shame of italy br br the american adverts about men turned inside out is as everyone says totally misleading and indicative of a roger take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy adventure thriller for grown ups the complete italian version is a somewhat sprawling well designed and deliberately paced take on island of dr moreau and there's nothing wrong with that it's a sumptuous handsome euro horror outing with a brain good plotting character development location shooting period costuming and sets etc br br but i must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid sleazy and unkempt roger corman version which has some nice over the top gore a flashy but preposterous opening segment and then the bulk of martino's original film albeit somewhat abridged to make room for roger's idea of entertainment the pacing was somewhat quicker the shock sequences closer together and you see just as much of ms bach's fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version br br i still don't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of a local voodoo subplot didn't help much and it's funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist perhaps a few more viewings are in order i will say this fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these pal imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the print but it's still interesting stuff and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be br br 7 10
<START> here's another of these modern day ultra sleaze comedies in which dysfunctional families are supposedly hilarious know wonder people once asked what ever happened to pauly shore well shore didn't disappear but his career took a nose dive that's for sure movies like this one didn't help br br in son in law shore plays an incredibly obnoxious character called crawl and yet he's the most likable of the family his father is a profane idiot his mother is totally incompetent his young brother is a sex maniac and his college age sister is a real snot br br watching an hour and a half of totally unlikeable people was tough to do i certainly wouldn't watch this again or recommend it to anyone but die hard shore fans adam sandler took shtick and went a lot further with it br br the following is an excerpt from the imdb title page here under biography and it explains why i am not the only one who was disgusted with this movie br br but his lunacy was dismissed as crude dumb and for the most part unfunny his film career quickly tanked this downhill spiral was not helped by the failure of his failed fox sitcom pauly 1997 in 1997 lambasted by both critics and media alike he was soon becoming a running joke and forced to lie low and ride out the storm
<START> there are places for political commentary in film but masters of horror is not one of them i get enough of this stuff from newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper now i've got to watch this in horror movies c'mon all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film not another bush is bad rant if joe dante wants to express his politics let him go on air america and if you must insist on making a message film be a little more sly about it this had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish br br by the way joe do you really want the left wing voting block to be associated with brain dead zombies might want to think about that before making another political horror movie god help us
<START> a must for any die hard carpenters fans br br cynthia does the role of kc a amount of justice and although the 'story' isn't 100 factual is still a good insight into the lives of both richard and karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack br br makes me cry everytime br br
<START> i have read a lot of books in my short lifetime but this is by far the worst i just got done reading this worthless piece of trash and when i finished it i threw it across the room i hated it and let me state the reasons 1 the soldier dies why would the author make the soldier die why couldn't she have kept him alive like a good love story author would do i deeply applaud patty for trying to claw that fbi agent's eyes out br br 2 ruth get's fired ruth the black housekeeper get's fired and for no apparent reason too she tried to comfort patty and then patty's sob dad fires her for no good reason ruth and anton and patty were the only bright spots in the book oh and the grandparents too 3 the perm yes the perm now you people might think why would the perm upset you well here's why patty's mom asks the girl if she wants her hair done patty says no but the mom calls mrs reeves the horrible hairdresser and tells her to give patty a perm why on god's green earth would she do that why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm only to have her get a perm anyway the mom always pretends that patty has a say when she dosen't have a say at all she should be given the worst mother of the year award for the stuff she dose to patty thank god ruth cut her perm off 4 discrimination and i hate the discrimination in this book they use the word beep too much yes i know that in those days blacks were free but had basically no rights but come on why teach todays children that word it just teaches them how to discriminate people not only were blacks discriminated but the chinese too in the book people refer to mr lee a chinese man as the beep that is really despicable and last but not least jews and i hate the town for spitting on a little girl what was so wrong for her liking anton she is a 12 year old girl it was just a crush like a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old come on this isn't lolita and lolita is a good book not a piece of filth i'm surprised that this movie isn't considered dirty like lolita is br br 5 patty going to a reformatory patty should not have gone to that reformatory are for thieves and murders not innocent 12 year olds the teacher or whatever she was called patty an ungrateful spoiled brat ungrateful spoiled brat my butt patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never gave a rip about her patty should of got community service or something she did nothing wrong she just helped a friend br br 6 the parents played favoritism with their children patty their daughter is clearly the least favored while sharon the five year old brat is their favorite daughter the dad says that he wanted to take sharon to hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter br br 7 the dad i hated him he was so mean patty might as well had hitler himself as her father her dad beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so mad you'll be caught thinking patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp br br well there you have it folks 7 reasons i hate this book instead of reading this book read the diaries of anne frank or anything else because i warn you it is very depressing and it will leave you really mad the only reason it gets 4 stars is because of anton patty ruth and the grandparents
<START> spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequel makers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the 1988 sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didn't like how the viewer got background information on the some of the all time creepiest horror villains in the original the third part hell on earth 1992 was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead pinhead a typical 90s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline 1996 is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary about the and the opening of the gates to hell br br seriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a 22nd century space station when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in 18th century paris ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by throughout the ages the film which takes place in the 18th century the present and the 22nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the film's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make up and gore effects the absolutely ravishing valentina as the she demon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light show overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinhead fanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon's creepiness all others are well advised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating 3 5 10
<START> imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self or even change him you would you try to influence or try to change your younger beliefs in light of your future experience or perhaps the encounter would change your older perception of life and reality br br walt disney's the kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting older self bruce willis in a collision course with younger self spenser breslin from the santa clause 2 and the cat in the hat fame the result is a sometimes funny sometimes touching encounter which makes you ponder about your own past present and future Â and truly believe it is never too late to change your course
<START> on the bright side it ended that's the only thing this movie has going for it of course br br this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen some bad ones this movie is actually so horrible i went and changed my rating for children of the living dead to a 2 just for not being raptor br br official one liner rating come with me to another movie if you want to live
<START> i went to see this by myself first to make sure it was suitable for my little boy to see br br thank goodness i did because i certainly would not allow any young child to see this why the violence death the funeral if you are not ready to explain these concepts to your kids then keep them away br br why on earth are these topics covered in a kids movie especially one that has a tag line of the original party animals might as well put a gangland execution in a hello kitty cartoon br br as for laughs there were very few and far between speaking for myself there were none the cows looked remarkably similar to the cows in the the far side comics i guess there isn't anything original about this movie apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all the young kids to enjoy
<START> well first of all i am a big fanatic of horror movies but however i am pretty sick of all those damn american horror movies they are all about the same thing blood and violence it's not even creepy well it's wrong with the blood and all that doesn't even bother me but that's not what makes a movie creepy that's why i find this movie entertaining it's fun to see a satire which is making fun of the main horror usa american splatter gore movies they are not suppose to be creepy only funny that's ok but when they're suppose to be creepy it mostly gets pathetic however there are a few great american horror movies poltergeist psycho birds but in the end it's all the same thing that's why this movie came as a relief evil ed is not just a cult movie it's a classic i can't wait untill master director anders makes another goddamn splatter movie untill than i have to watch evil ed again and again and again but i don't care it is such an outstanding movie
<START> i just called my brother paulie on the phone and he said he was watching hoods and it was funny so like i said never go against the family the demand for more lines is ok since i like to express my own opinions quite frequently if something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain this gives me yet another chance to take my shots at the departed when one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful all you need is a good directer the same guy i believe who did my favorite mob movie goodfellows but in a completely different way and then just throw in jack the great and you got yourself an oscar easy as pie i have to see hoods to make sure it wasn't better than the departed gibbs
<START> great movie the sound track is awesome very relaxing sound elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971 lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air the sound tracks written by sir elton complimented the movie to a t rex morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song honey roll and poem i meant to do my work today by richard le was incredible kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field
<START> this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths well written by shane black the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director jack clearly is a director that we should look out for in the future his strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom br br this thought provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action drama suspense and mystery as with all good films the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie the mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense you find your self looking for the answers along with marquette audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit with many awards received they must have agreed that a w o l 2006 is well worth watching br br i'd love to own a copy how do i go about getting one
<START> so lets say you are a producer you have some money and you somehow got richard gear and bruce willis so now all you need is a script but why bother see this movie is really terrible the acting is pretty good but the casting is awful gear and willis did their best to play these characters they simply cant play now this movie has no plot or rather there's something that tries to pass off as a plot there's a mean hit man willis who is cool dangerous and sophisticated actually he's none of those things but from some dialog between the other characters you are supposed to get this impression so this hit man is on a mission to kill someone now there's an ex ira prisoner who is kind and nice and very likable gear who the fbi release from prison so he will help them so now the fbi is investigating to find this hit man the investigation consists of a series of unlikely information like some random person lost his wallet and someone used his name to buy a car which is always right on the money since there's no real plot and the script is so crappy you cant expect any real character development or tension so instead of creating them through the story they simply add some disconnected dramatic music which signals you that something very dramatic is going on instead of actually creating something dramatic br br the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie and a complete waste of time which somehow got an incredibly high score for its level probably because of the cast and this is exactly what the producers where counting on
<START> this show is absolutely ridiculous yes of course its fake but it is agonizing to watch i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could make this seem real the young lead male couldn't be more unconvincing he line reads everything he says are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about there is a plethora of ways to blair witch this show up fear does not breed from what seems cool and computer generated nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as what was that did you hear that also there are real convincing psychics out there that don't just want to be on screen another duh factor is how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days if we are lucky they film i don't think so a 2 week at one site would be more convincing it is also disarming that they think including nasa radar checks and that show fancy bs really make us scared and ie exorcisms should not be staged like the film the exorcist when are they going to get it right possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently they don't just snarl and lower their voice like linda blair or around like courtney love on a drug binge as stated better on psychic ability would aid this show greatly we want to see and hear everything that flashes before them not cut away to other story bs on a final note shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of ufo's ahead of time might i stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely down right awful avoid this show for fright watch old unsolved mystery episodes not the new ones the recreation got it oh so wrong but that is for a different blog
