<START> this is a great film with an amazing cast crispen glover is at his freakiest his guitar solo is amazing also watch out for a cameo by william burroughs truly a cult classic this is on my top ten list don't miss this twisted film
<START> im a huge m lillard fan that's why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7 10 br br the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie br br its a good rental br br 7 10
<START> an astronaut michael dies while returning from a mission and his body is recovered by the military the base where the dead astronaut is taken to becomes the scene of a bizarre invasion plan from outer space alien embryos inside the dead astronaut resurrect the corpse and begin a terrifying assault on the military staff in the hopes of conquering the world according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br a roger corman american international production the man who fell to earth impregnated mr as john corcoran does all right angela greene is his pretty conflicted fiancÃ©e and ed nelson as dave randall is featured as prominently with a bigger budget better opening and a re write for crisper characterizations this could have been something approaching classic 1950s science fiction br br night of the blood beast 1958 bernard l kowalski roger corman michael angela greene ed nelson
<START> personally i can only but agree with stephen 12 indulge there's really no point in trying to this film i like movies where nothing explicitly happens herzog's der has got the same nothingness though that movie is less convincing since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story so herzog had to focus on nature versus kinski morte a venezia is wholly different though since it has several climaxes turns etc in fact from the point where luggage is lost the movie almost to its grand finale his final of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment of bliss where he fantasises about warning the polish family and caressing hair br br you can if you want to seek some real clues symbols in this one his trying to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives the pointing at the end the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in but there's no point in doing this it won't make the film better or worse since its force lies in the whole undertow which is never made explicit tons of history decaying europe the end of the 'romantic era' as we've come to know it which has proven to be only the beginning of it individual emotions expression are more important now than they ever were but wait now i myself am beginning to develop the one minor tiny flaw of the film the 'let's talk about art' parts now there's one thing never to do i myself believe it could have been expressed by other means furthermore i believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the film br br i don't like explicit films i can read books so i don't want a storyline that speaks merely to my rationale i prefer films that you cannot explain in words but only in film lynch's lost highway weir's at hanging rock and roeg's man who fell to earth also belong in this category for then and then only it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book so what about thomas mann's novella i've never read it but forget about it the movie gives a different point of view it says things you can never say in a book it uses the movie art to make you feel through images and music the same thing that mann made you feel using text equally brilliant but different worlds
<START> tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film the acting directing and script are all third rate with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer director star larry bishop to get laid the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with qt the plot of the film is pretty flimsy and basically tries to survive on not so obscure references to older b movies and some cameos from guys like david carradine dennis hopper and vinnie jones each one is listless in their performance particularly hopper who is in full on paycheck mode at this point in his career the saving grace if there is one is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining bishop tries so hard to get that trademark tarentino banter and just fails miserably which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others i'd only check this one out if you love bad movies or if you're really into biker films
<START> okay i can sit through almost any movie and i tend to get a real kick out of sci fi originals but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off half an hour into it br br having served in the us army there are certain expectations in a movie including the military at least some semblance of attention to proper military rank uniform and terminology is necessary if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience bats human harvest had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction on the lapel and later in the movie the time was listed as 11 00 hours but it was full dark outside even if the script was perfectly done and the dialogue spectacular and the acting oscar worthy if the people making the movie don't care enough about the movie to even bother to look up the proper way to display military time why should anybody bother to attempt to watch it
<START> i am an avid fan for instance i have the game then sell it bad mistake but then buy it again good mistake erm br br anyways yes this film is very good the fights are very cool music very good and the cgi you cant falter br br only thing disappointing with the film i felt was the lack of other character involvement it was almost all cloud which although is a great character u cant beat a of cid and barret br br but despite that the film was great in my opinion and a must watch br br overall a great film give and will give it 9 10 br br make more films like this and you'll be worshiped more so than you already are
<START> if you have ever seen a bollywood movie you know they are longer than most movies due to the multiple song and dance routines each one is over five minutes long fortunately this one has fewer song and dance routines and fits into the standard movie length don't get me wrong i like bollywood movies but tend to fast forward through the song and dance portions i bought this dvd because i am an ian fan although his role wasn't as large as i hoped he still had a good amount of screen time and his character was much different than his other roles br br overall this was a good movie like most bollywood movies there is at least one element of controversy conflict of the traditional indian culture but true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is had by all
<START> spoilers spoilers it's easy to see why the script for this film won an oscar at least during the first half my head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by noel coward plays a new york publisher why don't you publish books that you like ' what and corrupt the public ' who charms and manipulates his many hangers on then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre flying dutchman take off in which coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace very enjoyable until it gets bizarre viewed at cinefest in in march 2003
<START> abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog and it's awfully talky for a movie about people who don't speak english there's no adventure to be found here it's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback br br three pale face dopes wander the african wilderness and encounter warring man hungry tribes of amazons these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to invent makeup shoes and hair removal technology despite their desperation for the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones br br the only thing of interest as if there were any question is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951 plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with 1950s stripper moves no nudity or appreciable violence on the other hand you may be humming the catchy native song for days
<START> the kite runner should win an oscar it's perfect in every sense the story the script the acting the cinematography one would never guess it was filmed in china the story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression the depiction of life in afghanistan under the taliban is all too real and horrifying i have not read the book but i have seen comments that put down the movie because the book is always better it doesn't really matter no one put down gone with the wind because it wasn't true to the book as a matter of fact it won the academy award for best picture and several other oscars i think this movie is brilliant bravo to the writer and director and the actors
<START> stealing is a crime and these guys kenny and corbin bernsen look like their going to get away with it i haven't even seen this film but not only do i know it sucks but the fact that it steals the story of another film or 2 films for that matter is such bull crap and if imdb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap that i become filled with rage and feel as though i should just throw myself out the window and just end it all o k that's a little much but stealing is worse br br ever seen it was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008 this radio host goes into work and then this zombie attack happens we only see what's going on inside the radio station and the only guess we have on what's happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky ken easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind and the bbc calling in for an update on the situation from all the reviews i've read and from the conversation i had with my friend who has seen this film and this film was exactly like it in the story with minor tweaks here and there so throw originality and creativity out the window as for the zombies or the infected whatever you want to call them they are the exact same thing just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly and have a never ending quench for flesh they are zombies zombies br br zombies okay one to many but back to this crappy movie the zombies from what i've heard are a lot like the ones in 28 days later another better movie with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh this is where zombie movies define themselves story does not matter in a zombie movie as long as your not taking the idea of another film sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story as is the case with but the zombies have to be in a way original 28 days later started the insane raging zombie i can't even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film the evil dead i think all i have to do is just type the name again because come on it's the evil dead romero is the master and he went through all different types of zombies from the painted face zombies in dawn of the dead to raging zombies in diary of the dead and he did each one with his own unique style br br so after talking about other great zombie movies i think it's about time i explain why i hate this movie without even seeing it this movie down right steals the original story outline to which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing yet in hollywood it's allowed and apparently approved of this is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie and just tries to tell it differently the 90's is like the worst period for movies ever sure it had some gems but what decade doesn't and it's because all the movies were the exact same my favorite the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it till the very end they force feed you one suspect make it seem impossible that it's not anybody else but him then bam all this time it was this guy you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue say hey guys what did i miss oh didn't see that coming did ya well i'll leave a clichÃ© as my closing statement this is one film you'll surely want to miss
<START> this a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart i got lost in this sweet film watching it at the mann's chinese theatre in hollywood it's truly romantic with a touching message the artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so apparent the frames are like watching moving art it also has a strong and talented cast of actors what a wonderful surprise to see joss ackland he is just a fairy tale perfect king sarah douglas is terrific as the villain and christine taylor and tom schultz make a lovely romantic pair the fact that the movie was made on a ridiculously tiny indie film budget just blows me away it may not be the slick hollywood stuff we're inundated by but it's a really nice movie to rent and enjoy curled up on your sofa on a rainy saturday don't forget the microwave popcorn that's my advice just enjoy it
<START> before i saw this film i didn't really expect to much from it although my friend advised otherwise due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away from the credits i was falling of my seat i just couldn't contain myself the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy is the absolute double for the jewish barber who comes back from fighting in the war due to the heroics of the barber he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board which helps in the struggle which the jews had but things went wrong and stolz was arrested but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish 'the due to this escape the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped only to be mistaken for and consequently takes his the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic it the morals which society could only dream about in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the and which it entailed and it definately works because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest most prominent things such as war
<START> great acting great production values good direction br br but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half we're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered br br the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow through is weak for instance we're very clear that rudyard kipling is pro war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film br br this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books i don't feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea br br the depiction of the war itself is heart breakingly accurate though the women's lack of enthusiasm doesn't reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time perhaps this is historically accurate like so much in this film i simply don't know
