<START> this movie was a thorough there was no development of the story viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to fend for themselves in trying to work out what was going on the action sequences were okay but confusing they weren't the matrix and they weren't crouching tiger this movie is best left to cable tv where you don't have to pay to see it or convincing a friend that they should hire it and then go over and watch it as a huge jet li fan i expected more how can someone involved with once upon a time in china put his name to this one
<START> i bought this dvd for my young son who loves the movies i never expected it to be in the same league as the movies but what i got was just another lazy disney cartoon way below what i expected from disney pixar the story is unoriginal the characters are dull and two dimensional the animation is below par even buzz isn't that great the movie could have been so much better i especially hated the paint by numbers storyline i know it's meant for kids but even kids know when something stinks to this level lameness br br although i did enjoy some aspects of the movie i really liked the opening section of the movie with the slag mutant monster it just went downhill from there
<START> minor spoiler br br inhabited isn't scary but it is creepy it is an interesting 'little' story with good acting and great special effects makeup br br basic plot a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family's new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends br br the movie doesn't waste time getting moving though the ending could have been more involved br br i don't recommend this movie to those expecting wanting hardcore horror but i do recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller
<START> i was a huge fan of this series yesterday i watched it again on dvd i was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good acting wise bedi raja satish shah is brilliant whereas is plain bad but i think she gets the job done maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her this series shows what good clean comedy is br br if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 9 10 and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good i give it 10 10 i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd
<START> stay alive is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game the friends that play this game soon figure this out and then realise they must defeat the blood countess from the video game or accept their fates we've had video tapes in the ring a deadly website in feardotcom now it's onto video games stay alive does some things well the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie we really see into some of the characters feelings and past and get to know them all quite well so the audience may gain some emotions for them the film is also very suspenseful tense unnerving moments are frequently played through the film accompanied by unsettling creepy music there are plenty of jumps and jolts for the viewer this can be ideal once or twice but these false scares that hollywood seems to enjoy overplaying in horror films nowadays wears thin in stay alive the camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes in order to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen why the gore is obviously very weak because of the film's certificate the script to stay alive is very cheesy and quite laughable and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly also clichÃ©s come in from every direction for instance people wandering around on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a figure in the dark they will go and investigate it however the computer graphics used for the video game segments are rather impressive and look colourful and sharp working well with the other parts of the film but overall there is just not enough to hold out on with this film stretching at just over a hundred minutes it won't be a battle to stay alive but rather stay awake
<START> well i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning this movie wasn't it it plodded along at a pretty slow deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes but there wasn't really anything in it that i was terribly interested in there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between jean reno's character and an old man but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character whom i didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time he wanders around alone for the most part he doesn't meet anyone i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post apocalyptic world or something which is all good but i still wish he'd trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boring br br but after those 40 minutes things start to get very interesting i guess i won't really say more than that because i don't want to spoil anything so if you've seen the first 15 30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off like i was just stick with it it gets a lot better br br one of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever which really made me have to think about what was happening how characters were feeling and what their motivations were why things were how they were in this post apocalyptic world all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation and it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren't telling you exactly what's going on
<START> it's not like an historical movie it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere br br it had that 60's kind of bohemian and rebellious spirit a group of friends living in a poor apartment in paris each one making art dreaming of changing the world doing drugs and loving in his very own way br br it takes a lot of patience to watch and a special mood that if you're not in you might find it extremely boring and dull br br i liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on student's lives the fear for their future the difficulty of earning their living the obstacles in following their dreams br br what i absolutely loved was the black white image the still camera angles were amazing they were like freezing moments it left me the impression of a long slide show of old and very emotive and suggestive photographs i actually had to see the movie again just to take those amazing screen shots br br in one word beautiful

<START> i'm a pretty tolerable guy when it comes to movies even b movies i routinely watch some b movies for fun and they can range from surprisingly good to just downright awful i usually set my expectations really low before watching these types of movies and even after doing that descent was just downright awful i really didn't mind that they were ripping off the core to some extent but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material some scientists are worried about the earth's seismic activity and must travel into the depths of the earth in order to stabilize the so what we get is a monotonously long set up in which two dueling scientists played by luke perry and rick roberts have to work together on a top secret mission named project deep the man in charge general fielding played by michael dorn is secretly withholding vital information from assistant marsha crawford played by mimi rounding out the cast is natalie brown who plays jen a mission specialist who created the mole a drill which is used plunge into the depths of the earth br br other than some pretty good special effects and set designs nothing about descent is worthwhile the movie starts out fairly entertaining but it gets bogged down quickly in a tiresome story about uncontrollable seismic activity which has been done to death in other movies such as the core descent also has a poor script with useless forgettable dialog between the characters to make matters worse there is literally no action no real threat or danger the attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny the plot has gaping holes and some of the subplots are left untied at the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth br br in closing this movie was just a cheap way for everyone involved to get a paycheck there was no thought behind this movie no innovation it's just there other than some nice looking special effects and set designs this movie fails on every other level the story is from the garbage can of hollywood and the characters are uninteresting to boot descent will simply descend you into boredom and frustration avoid at all costs
<START> this movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it is quite awhile before you ever see the deadly mantis probably a better movie in the 50's this dated piece is a bit to slow moving and the pay off in the end isn't very good though it has its moments like when the guy from perry mason argues with an old man and when he says i have narrowed the possibilities to one excuse me but when you narrow something down you have a couple or more possibilities not one if you get it down to one you haven't narrowed it down but you have in fact figured out what it is the monster is standard 50's sci fi fair better than say the grasshoppers in the beginning of the end acting is sub par and the heroine is the most unattractive in fact in some shots she does look like a guy in drag you see plenty of fighter plane stock footage and other things but you won't see much at all of the deadly mantis
<START> the mod squad isn't a movie it's a void that's the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching Â i'd never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before it's a film without any reason to exist whatsoever seemingly consciously designed to appeal to no one as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike there is no plot there is no characterisation there are no set piece action scenes there aren't even any scenes as such just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second i'm not talking about empty as in dumb summer blockbuster but empty as in we haven't got the pages yet so just point the camera at something and stop when you've got 90 minutes worth it makes you appreciate the 'artistic of charlie's angels and s w a t that much more what it does offer is far too much of giovanni ribisi at his most tediously execrable doing his bastard son of a thousand morons impersonating marlon brando method acting routine michael lerner dancing with omar epps andÂ no that's it oh clare danes has a nice smile in one shot and dennis farina has the sense to get killed off early genuinely the most utterly pointless film ever made it's like without the jokes but you know for kids
<START> after watching this for 15 minutes i knew how it would end its a clichÃ© film with a stupid setup i'm a big fan of thief films but this one does not deliver anything new smart or special it's about an insider heist gone bad because hot head bad guy shots a bum and of course do goody bad guy goes on a moral trip the reason why it's stupid and not believable is when you've already gone so far to kill a bum why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and 43 million they got 45 minutes to stash the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot mr do goody and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days all and all i was leaning to fast forwarding from the middle of it but i it out and boy do i regret it
<START> spoiler alert br br this movie will spoil your afternoon or wee small hours of the morning viewing slot br br i like marc singer he has portrayed good characters in the roles i have seen until this movie br br what starts as a promising movie soon disappears up itself with the disastrous cgi'd background and the extreme close up on the person about to die br br then it gets worse br br a lot worse br br to describe it as hammy acting would insult pigs this movie goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and scrapes the acting off there br br apart from marc singer's overcooked hamming it up mike stomps and plods around the scenery looking as if he is afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide eyed bad guy just makes him look like a moron he isn't menacing at all br br george looks like a deer caught in the headlights he claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character would have been threatened by a cashier offering him paper or plastic br br this is really a vehicle for nicole eggert as an independent woman getting her life back despite attracting the wrong sort of man she was unremarkable br br this is not a remake but this is remarkably similar to cliffhanger seasoned guide loses someone in a fall conscience pricked to help out someone else a missing treasure worth oodles of money and a gang of do wells who exploit the guide except cliffhanger was a great vehicle for stallone and lithgow i must admit lithgow stole the show br br even the unintentional comedy was poor there were times when i wasn't sure if they were using a rubber faced model as a stand in for singer as he tried in vain to storm the weather station no pun intended pressing his face to the door post and his clumsy manner in general did nothing to help his character br br avoid br br no seriously avoid it save 96 minutes of your life and do something else more constructive like watching paint dry or grass grow or just close your eyes and examine the backs of your eyelids for 90 minutes
<START> if you liked paddy network you'll probably like this black comedy as well as it's another brilliant script a wonderful satire on big city hospitals and a perfect vehicle for geo c scott he plays a burned out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital have ever seen his personal crisis is coming to a head and his hospital's falling down around him as local residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate thanks to a biblically inspired and murderous saboteur the latter who theatrically declares himself the fool for christ of wrath of the lamb and angel of the bottomless pit bops doctors on the head lethal injections and swaps patients' identities causing treatments and operations to be performed on the wrong persons br br this film makes you uncomfortable as deadly mistakes like these do happen hopefully not so many not so often and not in one place and at the same time makes you laugh at the priceless character portraits one is richard l a law as dr a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends far more time worrying about his investments and publicly traded stock than about his patients who suffer lethally from his vast indifference and neglect there's diana rigg as free spirited hippie ish barbara drummond who seduces the beleaguered chief of medicine scott and tries to get him to run away with her then there's the deluded murderer who happens to be barbara's father and who functions well enough back at the indian reservation where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic but who's pushed to madness merely by being placed back in civilization the strongest portrait by far is scott's dr who bares his soul as former boy genius failed father and husband brilliant doctor and responsible administrator who constantly dreams of suicide but must bear up under the demands of his job scott is exceptional in this demanding role br br until the final scenes one doesn't know if will leave the hospital behind for barbara's indian reservation and a quieter simpler life whether her murderous father will be caught or whether the protesting rioting locals will take over and bring the hospital to its knees watching the crazed killer at work one suspects is telling us our lunatic society makes him do these things as we're told he's a different person away from cities and people br br as my own father was the chief administrator of a number of large hospitals over the years i had some idea of the demands of his job and the huge responsibility he shouldered this story makes that responsibility the linchpin on which scott's crisis turns this is both a funny and scary film with the actors up to the considerable demands of script it's also a film i get more out of each time i watch it
<START> i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind i have been a big fan of qt in the past i think we can all agree he has made some great movies but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own this movie proves that it consists of few scenes of the basterds at work it consists instead mostly of long tedious boring stretches of conversation between people that after a while you realise you just do not give a stuff about it's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that qt has been responsible for in the past the entire movie is anticlimactic there is no tension what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care honestly folks don't believe the hype this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it
