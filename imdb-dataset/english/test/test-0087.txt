<START> predictable unmotivated pointless caricatures contrived actors did what they could actors clearly indicated they were embarrassed to do this not one emotional connection real sequence from film who you sic the police sic you can't do that stevie hang up the phone sic jesse got a sh t load o' drug money you can't go involving the cops sic i'm not so sure stealing money from criminals is a crime even if they arrest him at least he'll be alive sic listen to me stevie this ain't handled right jesse's gonna end up dead now hang up that f in phone sic best friend starts to load up guns brother hey you doin' no answer hey i got a family to worry about keep in mind his child is sitting right there watching ish all of this then more and more and more exposition br br notice how in the above sequence at no time do the police on the other line say hello hello uh we can hear everything you're saying we're sending someone over there right now br br embarrassment for all oops
<START> i rented this film for 5 and felt sorry i did it i wouldn't give a for it if i knew this is the worse movie ever none of the filming locations was in former yugoslavia map at the beginning what the english actors are trying to speak serbian eg pretending they are serbs and they did it terrible bad my first language is serbian and i could not understand what they were about they drove a big jeep in a country where 3 sides croats serbs and muslims are in war and they wrote on it peace 4 sarajevo ha ha how stupid was that don't know why english are making stupid films about war like this one or even if they do why they are blaming serbs for everything when there was another two sides in a war too and we all know they were killing too not just sitting and pretending innocent so they should at least show the whole truth this film also harrison's flowers behind lines the hunting party and few others were total bullshit and that's proved eg the hunting party was biggest loser in 2007 08 spent 20 mil 4 it and they earned 800 000 ha ha what a crap the truth will come out sooner or later proud to be serb
<START> it's hard to believe a movie can be this bad but you live and learn what's more amazing is the fact that the people who put this thing together likely had college meanwhile the fruit of their labor bares the appearance of something a group of five eighth graders may have come up with on the bright side if there is one the soundtrack has some nice moments which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so hideously bad
<START> i was all in awe of the film looking at the promos and went to watch it the film was horrible to say the least br br the first scene is good and till they go to london things are funny but slowly the pace slackens and they is nothing funny about it br br the manoj joshi subplot is funny at places but is unwanted and adds to the boredom br br the drugs part is funny especially the monologue of govinda br br the film goes on and on aimlessly just like a small kid has written it br br the interval brings a twist in the story but by then i lost hope br br the second half starts okay but the way things are handled makes a mockery the entire arbaaz jackie angle is half baked also how come people don't identify them br br the climax is quite funny though stupid br br priyadarshan is not at all in his elements from this film he started doing craps and his films got bad and bad music is good signal tere bin stand out and too camera work is good br br akshay kumar has white in his stubble and looks old but he acts well though this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy acting things look bearable govinda looks out of shape bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprising from govinda seems too much pressure on him to comeback and priyan fails to utilize him paresh is okay in parts but overall just repeat act manoj joshi is funny at places sharat is okay shakti kapoor is great jackie looks overweight and acts in his sleep arbaaz khan is bad lara dutta shrieks to glory but fails to act
<START> i checked this out for free at the library and i still feel ripped off yes sandra bullock is actually in it but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes and even those are fairly painful to watch the rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it everyone else will just turn it off don't worry you aren't going to miss anything bullock's lines assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case are essentially just parroting of other characters lines like this dialog br br lisa bullock danny please tell me what is going on br br danny i don't know br br lisa mean you don't know br br danny i don't know it's something to do with my dad br br lisa mean your dad br br danny i don't know he ed up or something br br lisa why am i here br br danny i'm sorry lisa i don't know br br moments later danny some army buddies of my dad br br lisa mean army buddies br br see what i mean br br bottom line just say no
<START> a family a teenage boy his mother and a stepdad sick of city life decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start however their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father who don't take kindly to newcomers on their patch while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly the lad decides to take matters into his own hands br br veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made at first you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters especially the overwrought bad guys but then you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch or the sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero in fact the whole view of women in the movie which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves is pretty despicable but of course there's the obligatory nude scene which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra less under a very thin t shirt who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs right br br the climax centres on the teenager who up until now hasn't been able to sneeze without jumping suddenly morphing into a rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang it's completely implausible but hey so is everything else in this film so at least you can't accuse it of not being consistent so rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist check out the imdb pages for janet laine green stephen hunter jonathan etc notice a pattern emerging here their careers all hit dead ends why sit through this and all will become clear remember kids if you want to get ahead in this business hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you please 3 10
<START> this was a very good 1950s western one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv it certainly had three big actors on the marquee glenn ford barbara stanwyck and edward g robinson it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles ford had the bulk of the dialog he also was the good guy while robinson was the bad guy and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times br br ford handled his starring status very ably as he usually did especially in westerns he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight was a peaceful man but if you pushed him look out br br the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls not overdoing either it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the widescreen it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting that credibility with the characters especially the supporting players was most impressive the men way out shined the women in this film acting and character wise dianne foster and may wynn were weak the only negatives of the production it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars br br even though it is over 50 years old this western is one you'd still find fast enough moving to enjoy no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing for classic film fans this is almost a must with this cast and good story highly recommended
<START> i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channel on my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen from it as a best movie of the year br br all the character were simple and decent performances except the brain's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main culprit had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea god knows what happens to dave the male lead character br br the other critic from mr brown's movies said that shocking and effective but doesn't quite live up to all the hype which i saw after watching the movie for which i was partially i should have read this first before taking the movie
<START> well what can i say what the f k there really isn't much to say about this really the only way you would like this is if u like me like bad bad horror to laugh at br br acting very unconvincing just watch the last scene with the main actresses running rip off of texas chainsaw massacre but in a bad way just awful br br gore really not believable in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc by using this with the addition of red ketchup its supposed 2 look real although it really doesn't br br plot predictable get lost in woods on camping weekend' movie ripped off from friday the 13th br br killer quality scary mask if you're scared of clowns kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror camp movies out there br br total 3 10 p s stay away from camp blood ii that one made this look like lord of the rings
<START> if you are a pauly shore fan you will laugh your butt off if not this is a silly mess wasting some very good talent a cute coed carla from south dakota invites her california college dorm counselor shore home to share thanksgiving notable cast members lane smith cindy pickett mason adams and the drop dead gorgeous tiffani amber thiessen watch where you step
<START> you got it right bobby was mike's imaginary friend through the whole movie even at the beginning when on their way to california his mother knew of bobby and didn't discourage mike leaning on bobby since imaginary friends are common with young children br br that's why they both got stomach at the same time that's why the boys' were so close br br at the end mike was letting bobby go the king was arrested mike could go on without bobby it's also why mike's mother didn't seem disturbed when mike received the postcard mike had written mailed from bobby the ol' west tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world you noticed mike's mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark what a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixties br br a 9 out of 10 for me brought back memories
<START> this is one of the greatest films ever made brilliant acting by george c scott and diane riggs this movie is both disturbing and extremely deep don't be fooled into believing this is just a comedy it is a brilliant satire about the medical profession it is not a pretty picture healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend all their time making money outside the hospital and yet you really believe that this is a hospital the producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases this movie really reveals how difficult in is to run a hospital and how badly things already were in 1971 i loved this movie p s i noticed that the incompetent wheeler dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in la law the young doctor played in lou grant i also noticed that the registration nurse has appeared since in becker and other shows
<START> klaus kinski popped up in a sizable number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains kooky klaus lands himself a juicy lead role as crazy johnny laster a foul twitchy and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to abduct a lovely heiress in order to obtain her considerable inheritance johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry writer director mario costa ably crafts a compelling portrait of a severely sick and twisted piece of sniveling low life work the plot unfolds at a steady pace the tone is appropriately gritty and serious and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and brio the shoot outs in rock are especially gripping and thrilling ironically dressed in white oozing oily charisma from every rotten pore and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets kinski's johnny makes for a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous brute kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously repellent character he receives fine support from the luscious gabriella as sweet fiery saloon girl juanita steven as the cheery riccardo giovanni as ruthless band gang leader machete giuliano as smart lawyer gary pinkerton and paolo as johnny's sensible parter glen kudos are also in order for stelvio cipriani's moody and spirited score well worth seeing for kinski fans
<START> as bad as this movie is i really like it the poor acting dialogue and action made it so funny i loved john travis from omega cop and stayed up all night working out how the death machines checked in at the airport if they can't speak probably had to shake nod at the security questions actually why can't they speak it fails to adhere to any sort of movie making convention which makes it strangely interesting to watch just lots of people getting killed around a very loose plot surrounding hired killers no machines as such and those weird face mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear i love the fact that there is no good guy in this film until about half way through and i love the numerous pointless scenes of that aeroplane landing lots of people get killed who have nothing to do with the plot and no explanation is given about anything do not expect to understand this film instead admire how the main good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar who is presented as the bad guy yet speaks out against the barman's decision to hire a scantily clad woman to dance badly in the corner for entertainment all the good guys seem to enjoy this why did old guy get to beat up our hero and why did the random bloke decide to help old guy in the fight why did the hero collapse under one punch from old guy onto the bar where a stream of water jets out in the background so it looks like it's coming from his mouth definite top 20 b movie must check for a part 2
<START> i was recommended this movie by one of my film making friends and was therefore expecting something good sadly i was very disappointed by the first half ah a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their a hole boss how original and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45 odd minutes i'd already wasted but all i got was the 'shock' ending br br the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says whatever it does say hard to tell what that is badly great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i can't care about br br now maybe if i didn't moonlight in the movie industry i'd be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen but as it is my feelings are as summed up above br br 2 10 would have been 1 10 if it weren't for the acting and the paper cut scene
