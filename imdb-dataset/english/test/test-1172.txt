<START> i'm sorry fans but i was disappointed with this concert at the cbs television city in los angeles it's decent music wise but the presentation is simply boring big time most of the songs sound the same and lead singer writer jeff lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin he has a pleasant voice but he isn't much to watch he just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes the songs all sound like 1970s 1980s bubblegum stuff pleasant but not exciting br br lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman rosie but she isn't too animated either the only song out of 23 that creates any excitement is the last one roll over beethoven now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them this could have been a much better concert dvd
<START> this movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in istanbul as time passes their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest who is out of work and doesn't appear all that eager to find work that's most of the movie in fact the problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are very withdrawn and non communicative they don't make for a very satisfying movie that's because most of the time he and his just stare into space and say nothing i think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie i certainly wouldn't have minded
<START> i must admit ashamed though i am that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror chiller was one of my favourite all time films nine years after first viewing stephen king's frightening story however i have now come to my senses and am able to assess fritz work more reasonably br br indeed king's tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper but it makes for a cheap average horror show on celluloid a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker slasher show and then turns the finale into a hocus pocus special effects nightmare br br the cast are reasonable but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible over the top movie will allow them and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is than the pictures br br a real shame that george goldsmith's screenplay turned stephen king's haunting short story into a shocking horror isaac and all the other children of the corn aren't really all that scary br br sunday august 7 1994 video
<START> this is one of stan laurel's best solo comedy's before the 1927 teaming with oliver hardy laurel is a very good actor in the film and provides good comedy the best scene in the film is when stan dances with mae laurel his real life common law wife at the cafe espanol stan does silly dances that are funny without you hearing the music i will recommend this to any stan laurel fan
<START> may contain spoilers br br clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just can't see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name br br anyhow where to begin the bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over the top characters and more inconsistencies than george w bush's college career i don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack were getting killed also one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film how do we know it's him like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs a great camp film but a very bad film overall
<START> we really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie but we'll start with the plot we sincerely suspect that whomever wrote produced directed this movie never read the book because they missed the entire point satirical not horror just a hint second the bath scene enough said third the added characters the sketchy gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and we don't understand where this came from either and then there was the casting all of them were really unlikeable we were very upset that catherine and mr ended up together because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy and the music we think that the bbc producers ran out of money so raided their grandmother's attic and they found some old records saxophone wailing female voices and an occasional electric guitar shudder br br plus the best line ever since you left the white rose bush has died of grief if anybody has any explanation we would love to hear it because it makes absolutely no sense br br we are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public we think it should be considered a federal offense torture is illegal br br this movie is by far the worst we have seen to date and i've seen a lot of movies br br our recommendation give this movie to whomever you hate they will watch it and want to kill themselves and we agree with a previous post we would give this 0 stars if at all possible do not watch and we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production or were mentally insane these are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review
<START> the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is graveyard of horrors but i think that must be an error it should have been called graveyard of horrible acting horrible editing horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard br br horrible
<START> the film is essentially an older form final destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them the film has its moments and its concepts the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea if this movie were remade with a few good actors actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome as for the actual film i recommend watching the mst3k version the pure version might be too boring to sit through unless you love bad movies staring martin sheen's brother
<START> simply one of the best movies ever if you won't get it sorry for you i believe that someday people will include this one in their all time top 10's not now but in the far future
<START> i am really amazed how little fame this film had i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc br br don't be idiots if you are looking for a good fun take this movie this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great br br it's about well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they it's nice and cute and gives good time the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable br br why i gave it only a 9 well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable small spoiler the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him now i am not talking about some small cry but no hysteric cry and 30 sec after that the father goes out and baby is sleeping excuse me when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20 30 seconds but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama it's fun and this should be overlooked
<START> this movie is not worth anything i mean if you want to watch this kind of stuff flip to hollywood movies this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name neal n nikki seriously sucked never watch this movie as for the actors it appears the acting genes skipped a generation couldn't have worn less and chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son all of that halla re was amazingly stupid the songs are eh and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it bottom line i hated the movie do not let your kids watch it and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it buy the cd if you must as i said the songs are eh at least it is better then the movie
<START> seriously i donÂ´t really get why people here are bashing it i mean br br the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness br br especially in the second half of the film when the little killer snowballs attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it after that it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice that was fun br br bottom line incredible movie rent it
<START> i was hugely impressed with this movie if for nothing else than for the comedy it might not be the edgiest wittiest humor at all times but i found it appropriate to every scene br br the flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled almost confusing sometimes but that is how the characters feel sometimes we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers but it brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos br br the acting is great from everyone i'm a huge andy richter fan but i wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be he did very well but julianne nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me both in their respective ways jay mohr performs as expected if you've seen him in other films i've always liked him br br overall the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships when it comes to relationship questions and problems some films try to surprise there's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film
<START> before watching this movie my thoughts were like another israeli typical movie but i was suprised to watch i great israeli drama the plot is really good and the actors act great one of the best isreali movies i saw so at the bottomline i really recommend this movie
<START> i like underdogs so 12 years after having first seen star trek v and thinking it was bizarrely bad i gave it a second watch hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time around br br i didn't br br the writing is half baked and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet albeit shakily the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous what was even worse from the original cast's pov is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame including the special effects what an embarrassment br br the final frontier isn't thoroughly wretched i gave it 4 out of 10 but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors yes including the first one that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more br br unless it's an episode with troi's mother in it
