<START> this movie brings back so many memories for me i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it my dad and i would always watch the ernest movies together we hadn't seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap we watched them and could not stop laughing i love all of the ernest movies but this one is my favorite br br spoiler part br br the part i remember most is the magnet part my dad still does the electric chair scene br br end spoiler br br this is a very cheesy movie but a great one it's perfect for families it isn't like a lot of the trash out there but at the same time adults can laugh too if you like physical humor like facial expressions and the way people move then this is the movie for you
<START> honestly this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it if the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd it's not that shocking it's not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it rent it i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore but other than that absolutely nothing going for this over hyped mess on the other hand genesis sequel to aftermath now available as a double feature released by unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director really is when given the right material although i don't care for aftermath at all genesis is so well made that i will forgive and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future
<START> the series does not start as it means to go on although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes as well as numerous duds afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born the first ever episode of star trek the next generation is remarkable for two things it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast and marina peculiar accent which would later disappear seeing how it all began is very satisfying and viewed in mind of the rest of the series rather moving actually otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q and some giant jellyfish that's right
<START> i think this programme is a load of rubbish all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am bored with it i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show 'tv e g the weak joke the princess and the pea isn't exactly shakespeare is it that had sonia and naomi in stitches i don't see how that is funny i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv licence so this can be shown 4 5 days a week isn't there anything better than this
<START> if i had to pick the most depressing movie try to be suspenseful i've seen it'd be this one i know about how good the original is supposed to be it had better be better then this one the movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either i've seen depressing type movies that were saved because of the suspense to and the dark quality vanishing didn't have that this was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie i think another imdb poster got it right in saying this genre has just seen thrillers done in a far superior way i completely agree i would recommend skipping this one maybe i'll watch the original some day but i doubt it i give this a 2 out of 10
<START> i don't understand why this movie was released it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your mums handycam she bought in 1987 i am australian and work for a video store in the uk and thought that if an aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad boy was i wrong br br if anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film br br the picture was bad the sound was horrible and the acting oh the acting it was the worst acting in the history of film br br it makes me embarrassed and offended that they used the word 'aussie' in the title because i am proud to be australian and this movie is seen in other countries and may give people the wrong idea br br please anyone who reads this and has seen this movie take the time to find other aussie movies to watch because you could choose any one of them and it would be better than that one br br i could have made a better film if i took a camera filmed my but for an hour ate the film waited for it to pass through my body then threw what came out at the television no offence br br do not watch this film
<START> a guy with the unlikely name of shy walker looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half that's the entire plot with across the board bad acting of course walker wanders around a corn maze maize i get it hahaha not funny and yells girls where are you about 1000 times for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin a chipmunk sounding voice laughs as if the pumpkin is laughing at him yeah ok his daughters scream for most of the movie even when there is no reason to scream maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie twin girls straight out of 'the shining' show up every now and then most of the corn maze looks the same so walker's search gets very old very quickly the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie even the music is repetitive so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast filming upside down inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles using red lights to make the corn look scary and rotating the camera 360 degrees at least i'm assuming these were done intentionally but it's likely just examples of incompetent film making more often than not when walker is wandering through the maze you can't see his face i guess the kid holding the camera can't look up that high this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'dark harvest' which doesn't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield don't be fooled by the r rating walker says the f word three times and now we have an r rated horror movie ugh the scarecrow on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back you know things are bad instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr walker so i didn't even realize he was being followed for a while i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together natch the end of the movie drags on and on and just in case it isn't slow enough there's some slow motion the last sound you hear besides your own laughter is very poor sound dubbing in case you can't tell this is the worst movie i've ever seen at least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel
<START> many of the earlier comments are right on the money but some well not so much br br this is hardly a 'b' movie it's well produced the live flying sequences are really superb and the model sequences are first rate it's no cheapie br br is quite good in this and it makes a a nice companion piece for only angels have wings br br if you want to spot john wayne spot j carrol naish first they end up together br br tom browne is juvenile enough and somewhat dull but when they saddle him with the most pathetic pencil mustache in hollywood history it makes his character even less believable sally is much more so br br as for later influences this is wellman in the early airliner in distress zone the opening sequence of this film with the airline operations guy arriving at the grand central airport would have fit very nicely into the high and the mighty just imagine regis toomey and a 1955 buick
<START> even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies this one stinks the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a forbidden part of forest which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor fast forward actually you'll want to fast forward through much of this mess to the present day where a couple of campers are butchered the teens follow in their wake while a semi concerned park ranger a sleepwalking jackie coogan and his healthier cohort who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run of the mill nature footage padding finally more killings but nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before if you want to see the kids butchered opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the 13th over this
<START> i knew as soon as i saw the first trailer for black snake moan that i would have to see it i was not disappointed in the slightest in the film which was written and directed by hustle and creator craig brewer it tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake but also his own yet it's so much more than that it's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty sticky sultry blue memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward br br the characters are for the most part multifaceted and very well written and performed the accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly however there was one weak link in the chain justin timberlake the best i can say for him is that he can pull off crying it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly however justin's ronnie was flat but as an actor he was trying very hard i would definitely give him another chance br br lazarus and rae samuel l jackson and christina ricci respectively have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other this is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and luckily both of the actors were up to the task br br the music was very bit as good as you would expect especially when mr samuel l jackson sings the blues phenomenal br br on the technical side all was brilliance as far as i could see it was well edited well shot and well mixed everything was great the character and set designs were just right the casting of the supporting characters even justin timberlake and especially kim richards was spot on loved it
<START> to quote one critic's review of the movie it started off slow and stopped the plot was believeable enough although some of the characters' actions seemed very very random the script was fairly well written in that the dialogue did not seem forced but everything went way too slowly there were too many pauses between lines and the way the lines were delivered was not all that great this movie had potential but blew it like a teenager turning to drugs my advice wait for it to come on tv before you see it
<START> corniness warning as many fellow imdb users already know i'm not a corny cheesy person if you don't want to read this kind of review then go br br to tell you the truth you're hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene br br spoilers br br one day i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts former child star last year in august the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly it was for radio the moment i saw the trailer i just had to see this movie on opening weekend when that weekend rolled along scary movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out good boy and radio i couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks i was busy with more important things about 5 months later my friend rented radio he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room i'll tell you this now this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever when radio's mother died it just came out automatically the next day i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd br br well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie br br cuba gooding jr stars as a mentally challenged man nick named radio ed harris co stars and this movie is directed by mike based on a true story radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around he's got his own collection at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film one day radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on ed harris plays mr jones the football coach they meet and this is the life of radio br br throughout the whole movie radio and coach jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys the lowest lows and just seeing radio live his life you will laugh cry and live the life of radio with him this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if you're someone who just wants a great drama radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen radio will never be forgotten by me never br br as ed harris' character said greatly near the end of the movie br br we're not teaching radio radio is teaching us br br my rating 8 10 br br eliason a
<START> there are movies that are so bad they're good then there's movies like rest stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful br br bad acting unlikable characters predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note br br i can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all i really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all it's 1 5 hours of your life that you will never get back br br 1 10
<START> i saw the reader at a film festival in manhattan this week it touched my heart in a way that few short films have done in ten or so minutes it tells a poignant two character story that resonated deeply with me duncan rogers has done a superb job capturing very real tender moments on film what i really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format these are genuinely interesting characters and their story is told in the perfect length of time this is no small feat haven't we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format or stage stories that weren't properly adapted to screen i applaud the reader for really doing it right and i encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously worth every moment
<START> square really landed this one they didn't try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on final fantasy 7 fans and boy are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie the story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honest to god funny moments a total surprise there and a welcome one too br br there are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too and most important of all the fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond they are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked i mean they are some of the best ever created period br br see this movie bye br br ps i know my review sounds like the ravings of a teenage girl it was like totally what i intended
