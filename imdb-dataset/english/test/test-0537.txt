<START> this is one of my all time favourites all the actors do a great job comparing this movie to lawrence of arabia does no justice to both movies the wind and the lion levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere action and beautiful pictures are provided as well which all together guarantees a favourite movie to me
<START> a young man named danny has run away from home and meets a drifter named who agrees to tag along with danny and watch out for him and his money they end up in a small town where they meet carrie a shy naive girl working in her father's diner starts seeing carrie but he plans on leaving soon because he's a drifter see he's no good understand meanwhile the town creep jesse played by a perfectly casted jack elam keeps showing up at the diner and bothering carrie danny keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right because he's loaded with money Â he has almost a hundred dollars whom has to constantly chase away there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between danny and in this flick eventually and danny decide to leave town but trouble is a brewing due to jesse the creep br br my review of the movie itself a terrible dated troubled youth flick from the '50s br br my review of the mst3k version of the movie i've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever the riffing is dead on all the time except for the somewhat downbeat ending this movie is easy material for joel and the bots especially danny's constant screw ups that has to rescue him from the host segments are pretty good too especially the segment with the train song ' hopefully rhino releases this episode to home video one day
<START> in world war ii a badly burned amnesiac known only as the english patient is found in the african desert and is transported to italy where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery among them are hana juliette binoche a canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends kip andrews and hardy kevin whately two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs and david caravaggio willem dafoe a canadian soldier of fortune who knows the identity of the english patient and has a score to settle br br through flashbacks we learn the story of the patient he is ralph fiennes a hungarian explorer who in the late '30s falls in with a group of british including geoffrey clifton colin firth and his wife katharine kristen scott thomas while mapping the deserts of north africa after clifton leaves them on government business katharine and clifton fall in love with each other in the desert resulting in an affair that naturally has a less than happy ending br br if one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line such as why would a patient found in africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in italy then you can appreciate the english patient as a throwback to the intelligent layered sweeping epics of david lean in the '60s much more than titanic or other epic romances of late this movie puts one in mind of doctor zhivago and gone with the wind an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop you shouldn't expect a war film though there are some striking if all too brief scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections as is usually the case interrogation by a sadistic ss officer jurgen prochnow in particular br br the movie is very ambiguous in regards to pretty much everything the central question of the film is how far are you willing to go for love as critics of the movie are fast to point out is on the surface a far from likable character he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the germans causing the death of his friend julian and the torture of caravaggio and actually killing a british soldier who has him under arrest at one point the fact that is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point he's in love with katharine and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country or anything else for that matter is secondary as says he hates ownership being owned the two engage in a rather bold love affair shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a christmas party and it's clear that katharine is more drawn to the mysterious exciting than the comparatively boring geoffrey br br the 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous the romance between kip and hannah is never completely believable and i feel the film could have done without it but those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film so i won't complain too much br br like the epics mentioned above the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes strategically placed posters and military presence we do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in cairo but it's helpful to know the direction of anthony and the desert cinematography by john are absolutely gorgeous the sand dunes sand storms and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail gabriel score is haunting and atmospheric br br the acting is generally solid fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious complex and haunted the difference between the of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable one exciting and somewhat carefree the other haunted and reflective kirsten scott thomas is effective as katharine the female explorer looking for adventure and colin firth gives one of his best performances as geoffrey who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting willem dafoe does nice work as caravaggio the shifty hunted thief turned spy driven by revenge jurgen prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of jose ferrer in lawrence of arabia and a similar character too very brief but more memorable then some of the major characters some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable juliette is nothing special while andrews is good but unremarkable kevin whately as kip's ill fated partner does what he can with a rather role br br the english patient is not a perfect movie by any means but the attacks on it by much of the movie going public are not deserved at all maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the leans and kubricks or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand complex to fault brilliantly directed and shot the english patient is a wonderful modern day epic br br 8 10
<START> the artist daniel king chris john and his mate laura peters lara clancy are invited to move to an old house in cornwall in great britain by his childhood wealthy friend natasha carlton carol natasha has a crush on daniel who is an ambiguous man regarding his sentimental life while alone in the house weird things happen and laura is startled and scared when laura meets the old insane priest gabriel norton brian blessed on the road she is advised to immediately leave the house since evil lived there but the couple stays and has to face tragic consequences br br what a messy screenplay and awful and cheesy movie this devil's harvest is the cinematography and the camera work is not totally bad but the amateurish performances of chris john and carol and direction of james shanks together with the terrible story ridiculous situations and dialogs make this movie one of the worse i have ever seen in the genre i have occasionally seen in youtube a couple of shorts from cinema college that are better and better than the pointless and dreadful devil's harvest in the end it is not a horror movie but a horror of movie my vote is three br br title brazil a do diabo the devil's harvest
<START> this was indeed an amazing adaption i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline but as soon i watched the second and then the third instalment i was just blown away i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book from the moment i opened it i was hooked i just couldn't put it down i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time but considering only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot i think it was done excellent it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly and the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing the love making scene was pure beautiful it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the tipping the velvet adaption quite enjoyable but when i read and watched i knew none of her previous novels adaption could beat it sarah waters has indeed exceeded herself this time i recommend that you watch this adaption if tipping the velvet wasn't your thing then don't let it put you off this one is a whole new ball game it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love greed and betrayal br br a must see
<START> i went into this film thinking i wasn't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless but don't get me wrong delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law kidman and zellweger even though portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film the locations are beautiful and has an eye for a good shot br br however for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to and his adaptation the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what i consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film i didn't have the time to emotionally invest or hadn't recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable overall the cold mountain almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all i remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters
<START> wow its been quite a while since i've watched anything so mysterious in the way it is portrayed br br a detective story uses old fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old fashioned trench coat and hat the theme of this animation is reminiscent of that of sam which was briefly mentioned by ash br br sick of spying on cheating house wives because of his clients ash was offered a chance to track down a computer hacker which he thought was a worthwhile chance for a four figure sum he could not turn down and the rest is history br br the ending was a little bit bland but still okay for those out there who like old fashion stories this is the one for you
<START> this was a great movie i would compare it to the movie the game you get to the end of the flick and cant move your brain has been removed and shaken not stirred and put back in your head dont plan anything after this movie you will need time to think about what just happened br br dont come to this movie expecting the matrix style multi millions spent on special effects this movies special effects come from the actors they keep you involved no they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie great acting great plot very enjoyable film i cant say enough also very original plot plenty of twists and ideas that i would have never thought of the ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering was that real is this really the end good ending not saying that it is bad just leaves you wondering and a little frazzled br br great movie for those who like action like a good plot dont get up for a bathroom break on this movie you will come back lost and like mind games because thats exactly in a nutshell what this is
<START> robot holocaust is about the lamest most pathetic attempt at making a post apocalyptic movie that i've seen and i thought the italians were the masters of wretched mad max wannabes some of those movies like escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo the plot is nonsensical Â even with a narrator setting up every scene and boy does it drag scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening the special effects and i use the word special loosely consist of sock puppets yes that's right Â sock puppets the acting is abysmal is in the running for worst performance i've ever seen sure she's french or german or whatever Â but man is she bad i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie so i'll stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too many br br however and fortunately for me i saw the mst3k version of robot holocaust some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this mst3k episode a winner for a season one episode the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time on my mst3k rating scale i give this episode a 4 5 Â seek it out
<START> let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of abbie hoffman and have read steal this book and steal this urine test also am a even bigger jerry rubin fan but his movie was a pile of rubbish that made a very pg version of abbie hoffman the director took no chances into making abbie hoffman interesting in this movie they stew albert as a f ing cartoon devoid of intellegence the man was a at berkley for ok they did a horrid casting job for anita hoffman did a horrible job casting for the jerry rubin character i just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that i have seen of abbie or the books that he wrote the movie just didnt fit and upset me oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over i have ever heard of richard nixon this is one of the few movies that i have ever rented that i could not sit all the way through because i have a passion for abbie hoffman and his band of and this movie was just plain badly done and it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the they will see a terrible adaptation and not get a true sense of reality instead they get a hollywoodized of crap br br
<START> this is a pitiful movie what makes it even more pitiful is the time effort and money put into a super predictable script and action br br it's about some kind of monsters by the way and some kind of insects don't expect an explanation of the plot there is none that might work if there was something of interest or characters we could care about there isn't everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other movies sci fi channel does br br don't try to understand what some of the characters are saying they speak gibberish especially the annoying lead woman whose accent is a sort of thick british that is harder to understand than any old british movie you may have seen she's unintelligible br br a lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery and that is the major crime of this movie because it just isn't worth it
<START> diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving br br set in let's say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and and a film of the while the sun sinks slowly in the west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world
<START> hilarious sellers at his funniest a shame you can't get this on video or even see it on tv anymore i'd love to get a good copy somewhere maybe it's tied up in court on some legal issue but a truly riotous hospital farce with sellers as crooked administrator
<START> madonna gets into action again and she fails again who's that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people don't want that she's successful both as a pop star and a movie star the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title track single was hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth madonna failed as an actress 'cause the script was quite weak not so bad especially for those who like the 80's it's such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie at the end it's very funny to watch it
<START> iÂ´ve seen this at the fantasy filmfest in cologne and left the cinema halfway through this movie with a bunch of other people so maybe iÂ´m not the right one to comment on it but i think the fact of leaving s c is reason enough to do so s c is a different film people who need a coherent narration characters or a plotline wonÂ´t find anything in this one itÂ´s supposed to be an experimental film relying on the power of images but these images have no power they are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out that they have nothing else to say the gibberish of the off narrator is simply boring the visuals are cheap ok the effects are good but if thatÂ´s the only thing why care film wants to be shocking and thought provoking instead it is boring and annoying in its non creativity note not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore especially not if everything is executed as bad as in s c iÂ´d suggest director hussein should either visit a psychiatrist or a filmschool before he mistakes crap for art again note i never want to see a baby getting slashed during birth again
