<START> it was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989 as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960's the acting the characterisations the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier time br br the film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the a bomb on hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family a young woman who lives with her aunt and uncle even in black and white and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but emotive and effective nonetheless the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific family members become unrecognisable to each other others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shock br br the title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb which was mixed with radioactive ash and in which is caught rumors of being in hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospects and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing the film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the japanese but on the social and psychological damage that was wrought br br i found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture while the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family the film's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time wars have horrific consequences and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary it is said that history repeats itself and the current leaders of the of the have learned nothing while atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945 other deadly after effects have this film is compelling viewing
<START> spoilers simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle br br natalie aka sara ravenna shirley knight has become overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she's now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back taking off from her homes in long island new york natalie has no idea where she's going but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heartland of america it's on the pennsylvania that natalie picks up hitchhiker jimmie killer james cann who seems as lost and confused as she is as natalie calling herself sara at the time soon finds out jimmie had suffered a serious brain concussion while playing football on his collage team and has been reduced to such a simple minded individual who's so passive that he lets everyone including later in the movie natalie step all over him br br sympathetic at first natalie becomes very annoyed at the self pitying jimmie for not standing up for himself and letting himself be used as a doormat by everyone he comes in contact with in the movie not knowing what to do with the child like jimmie natalie finally gets him a job in far off nebraska as a cleaning man at the reptile jungle pet market owned and run by mr alfred tom being the both kind and simple minded person that he is jimmie lets all the animals out of their cages causing havoc at the pet store and has him fired by his boss mr alfred br br in the meantime natalie who thought that she was finally through with jimmie ends up back at the reptile jungle when she's given a speeding ticket by traffic cop gordon robert duvall it seems that mr alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that natalie is to pay her traffic fine to while all this is happening gordon the cop had developed a strong liking for natalie and wants to get her in the sack at his trailer home the first chance he can gordon a widower with a uncontrollable 12 year old daughter rosalie needs a mature woman with lots of lovin' to make him forget his many social and psychological problems and natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor ordered br br spoilers wild and shocking final with gordon going completely out of his mind and attempting to rape natalie who refused his drunken advances which has jimmie finally get out of his self pitying stupor and came to her rescue there's no happy ending here with natalie saved from being both manhandled and raped by gordon but jimmie who was bouncing gordon around like a ping pong ball ending up dead for all his good and noble efforts br br jimmy by far was he most tragic and sympathetic person in the entire movie all jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with and all he ended up getting was the sh t end of the stick by everyone even the one person who at first treated him with kindness and understanding natalie ravenna in the end jimmie even though he was treated like dirt by everyone despite his willingness not to offend even those who stepped all over him came out as the most likable kindest as at the same time heroic person in the entire film
<START> saw this for the first time on uk tv with good musical accompaniment the elevator scene is class especially when he does the going down thing in the phone booth and then fiddles with the floor indicator the jump through the is really impressive and there's so much more apart from all the stuff that's been mentioned before there's the fight with the man who's been bullying the woman with the dog it just looks so simple the only drawback is the plot he gets mixed up with dead eye dan who then escapes but doesn't reappear even when some more gangsters get involved later on the scene where it looks like he's shooting at the fat inspector is funny but would have been better if dead eye was the one pulling the trigger
<START> the directing is brilliant the casting is remarkable though i would've loved to have seen a little more of aaron lustig from y r fame who played paul shaffer i only have two minor quips about the film as subtle as they are one leno is excellent but his stage presence i e during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes is a tad underwhelming two the distribution of the foul language i am willing to tolerate foul language so long as it is not used gratuitously and to a degree the film was gratuitous the language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of bates' otherwise well portrayed by her frequent use of it and served to make leno a goody goody by his lack of use of it of course if the characters really did behave this way kudos to everybody nonetheless the piece is an excellent one as far as television and video are concerned the film i feel had potential for the big screen but would've required re casting for the bit parts and probably a different director as well the aesthetic feel is that of the larry sanders show good for hbo mediocre for cinematic purposes
<START> i thought this was an extremely bad movie the whole time i was watching this movie i couldn't help but think over and over how bad it is and how that was 3 69 down the drain the plot was so jumpy they did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school but they never really explained anything after that was it a supernatural thriller was it a regular thriller apparently you can decide for yourself because they didn't see the need to explain i understood basically what happened i think what i got confused about was all of it prior what was the deal with the bloody noses phone calls etc was this guy coming back was the wife channeling carrie or something who knows you certainly won't after watching this movie
<START> firstly few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover secondly few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks thirdly few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm fourthly once a second member of a college small group project team meets a violent demise the college president will disband the whole class and not turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths since the supernatural elements of cult make absolutely no sense it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks
<START> committed stars heather graham along with casey affleck and luke wilson its the story of who is determined to find her ex husband who is in the process of a mid life crisis br br committed was not at all what i expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre it was beyond stupid and un realistic casey affleck delivered a reasonable performance graham's recent roles have been lack luster and this is not an improvement br br graham's most recent role was blessed which i also found misleading and didn't appeal to me at all br br pros affleck br br cons predictable unrealistic poor acting and not a comedy movie
<START> there is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail think of that conman w c fields in the old fashioned way or the marx brothers in a night at the opera or chaplin in the adventurer of mae west in she done him wrong the of the law is inevitable and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic think of lloyd in his first talkie welcome danger trying to assist the san francisco police department in the midst of a crime wave and making police sergeant edgar kennedy want to kill him think of laurel and hardy as ill fated cops in midnight patrol i find this type of hostility is so patent in all these giants' and their peers' comedy that even a fake title for a film deals with it think of jerry seinfeld in one episode of his series creating a three stooges short sappy where the boys end up being electrocuted for murder br br buster keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies look at steamboat bill jr where he tries to spring his dad from a but he actually had more conflict from police forces in his shorts in convict 13 he is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict in cops perfect title if you see it you'd understand the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for keaton mistaken for a terrorist and in the goat he is unable to avoid the police for most of the film br br keaton is a tramp just looking for food but he is totally unlucky when he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe which keaton earlier ignored over his shoulder and then find a wallet full of money keaton tries the same thing and hits a cop in the head the cop gives chase and keaton as luck would have it runs into another cop tries to act normal but ends by throwing the other cop into the path of the first soon he has three cops chasing him briefly shaking them he walks by a window at the local jail where local murderer dead shot dan malcolm st clair is being photographed passing in back of the barred windows keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in the desperado notes this and ducks as the picture is taken when dead shot flees the police it is keaton's face on all the wanted posters br br st clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies although in his later biography would be a stint at 20th century fox where his work with laurel hardy was below par br br keaton flees to another town by train the passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and tender this is the film by the way that has two famous keaton jokes his arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant shot with it coming closer and closer and suddenly the audience sees keaton sitting on the br br the second famous sequence goes later and may have influenced chaplin somewhat in the beginning of city lights keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog virginia fox when he sees the poster's calling him a murderer he thinks he killed the man he is being chased in this town by a suspicious chief of police joe roberts and momentarily loses roberts in the park a statue of man of war is being constructed and the sculptor is unveiling a clay model of the horse keaton is seen seated on the clay model trying to maintain his dignity as the clay legs of the horse start collapsing under his weight br br keaton manages to meet the pretty ms fox who invites him home for dinner only he doesn't realize her father is roberts the last five minutes of the film deal keaton fleeing and avoiding roberts while he and fox get away together br br it's a funny comedy and a wonderful example of keaton's work at his best
<START> go fish garnered rose rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise br br its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms the entire film rings hollow i cringed the whole way through br br its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality well not much more here to be learned than from in and out by now most of us actually do know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes br br seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style br br pathetic
<START> what is the story what is it on the screen at first i must say do not touch this movie it is for your own best it sucks and really what is the story in the beginning it seems okay but after ten minutes it all gets worse and that is not all you can hardly see what it is on the screen it is too dark all the time br br do not touch
<START> i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 i remember i was already familiar with elijah wood's work that's right he made stuff before lord of the rings and the merchandising tie ins to the film were pretty abundant flipper water guns were even circulating br br adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for nostalgia's sake took their kids to see it who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy br br unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and flopped severely you know a movie's in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away and the kid instead of getting out of the water into a boat floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there perhaps even below him br br another problem is paul hogan he looks old crusty and tired of recycling his croc dundee shtick by now no one even remembered crocodile dundee much less hogan and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish out of water social satire laughs br br all in all this is a really poor family movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in '96 and i hate it more now
<START> i can only say this from portugal i couldn't say it better the worst movie i've ever seen and i've seen lots of crap when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it uses the same tricks in all his movies and his scripts are not much better either and of course in barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on vacations please be serious and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors there is something remarkable too it is fair to recognize it compared to the usual level all the spanish actors use a fairly good english
<START> what a great movie this was is it heaven hell or something in between i disagree with many reviews of this movie saying that this is a depiction of hell it is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end further it is not clear that the main character goes to hell but perhaps someplace in between the review i read on imdb says this is hell but i disagree whole heartedly take into consideration that perhaps good people who commit suicide may not be condemned to hell this only one religious belief this is indeed a thinker and i have would recommend it to anyone who likes that type of movie definitely worth it
<START> a very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health terminal illness and euthanasia sound a bit too heavy it is a little but this is all treated in a realistically straight forward way within a story of the changes that take place to the family who have to deal with these things this is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isn't overwhelm by the subject matter br br afterlife is beautifully shot and crafted film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues it is a character driven enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances br br unfortunate it is not the sort of film that always performs well at the box office so catch it while you can
