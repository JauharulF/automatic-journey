<START> i don't know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago but if you're expecting the events described on the box forget it that would have been a good movie the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter that i took viewing this movie if you've seen hbo's taxi cab confessions this is the same thing only fictional and not even remotely as interesting if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver check out the 20 minute short they run on encore from time to time it is actually worth watching i have never ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this thing boring boring boring it does offer one unique trait which is this it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers letting your imagination fill in the gaps which would be great if you actually cared about any of these people instead i found myself yelling at the screen weeping like a child praying for either the end of the movie or my own death the cab driver himself though well played considering runs through emotions seemingly at random from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic sometimes it is appropriate most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake dammit i learned all these emotions in acting class and i'm gonna use them now that i've been thinking about it again i do hate this movie as much as i did
<START> i chose this movie because i was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl two boys as i lived this situation and get lost in it i hope a similar story would inspire me br br my major concerns are why a how b the triangle forms why c how d the triangle degenerates br br a the movie offers a plain answer because it's better br br b here it's an open triangle the three share things together mine was a closed one every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one br br c the movie doesn't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual emotional assumptions the end comes with sensuality sexuality coming up in the triangle or more accurately when for one member deep feelings are tied with intimacy and as for the latter and the former they can be divided i agree with that br br d in the movie in my story silence is the proof that something isn't well and in a ironic and painful way the tool for this sad times is always the phone i lived this dreadful planned phone call call me back i wait you Â and when time comes the phone is a variation is also shown when the line is connected but one refuses to all those scenes were very very hard to see for me br br if the movie was a great help in that way he got also a lot of flaws br br i zapped on the boy's family problems br br why the shower scene on the dvd cover is cut on the movie br br how gets finally into the hotel br br is clÃ©ment always seeing salomÃ© he says no but has her address and who is the girl with him in the bar his girlfriend how can she knows about the address br br what finally happens to vanessa the ring at the final shoot is a proof of engagement with whom
<START> this movie deserves a 20 10 if i could give one the hollow is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel there was no major difference that i could spot the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel the acting was superb and the music as usual was amazing quality david suchet is perfect in his role and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either in no other movie that i've seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly hats off to the producers they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come
<START> as with footprints 1975 i became aware of this one purely by accident it was mentioned in a review of the libertine 1969 which i researched when that film turned up on late night italian tv as being in a similar vein incidentally i missed out on that screening of the libertine though i acquired it via the same channel later on but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the english dubbed r1 dvd during my sojourn in hollywood in late 2005 early 2006 actually in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it i was let down by the libertine â being too light hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme the sado masochistic relationship between a young couple to be honest for much of the time i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked if not exactly unpredictable final twist br br the film concerns the social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era an eminent philanthropist philippe leroy invites a female journalist dagmar lassander at his fashionable home for the week end however it transpires that heâs a misogynist who all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate or even kill them therefore for the first half of the narrative we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at hands including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image the tables are subtly but unsurprisingly turned she not only herself from his control but teaches him that man and woman can co exist harmoniously â except that following her own personal agenda as well br br the leads are perfectly cast and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood furthermore itâs greatly abetted by a typically effervescent score from the ever reliable stelvio and the imaginative â even outrÃ© â look the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form with a steel trap where its sexual organ should be seems to from freud incidentally this prop figured prominently in stills iâd seen previously from the frightened it barely registers in the film proper other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program aberrations and the and an idyll at a castle belonging to family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a manservant one of the highlights then is easily erotic dance virtually in the nude â an episode which actually spearheads the of leroy eventually the two characters have a in the latterâs pool â amusingly set to a spaghetti western type theme br br in the long run for all its stylishness the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous japanese masterpiece by yasuzo masumura blind beast 1969 finally itâs worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the u s by film maker radley company films he would even employ its production designer enrico for his own camille 2000 1969 to get to the edition i watched apart from the usual shortcomings in the english dubbing department the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack by the way there seems to be some confusion with respect to the filmâs running time its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes â all i can say however is that the copy i own ran for 87 minutes
<START> you got any beans beans is good you just eat them and you go i couldn't help but laugh at that bit of dialog beans are the musical fruit you know the more you eat them the more you go toot toot toot br br hmmmm ok i can understand why the actors were in this because they needed paychecks to pay their bills with but i'm not really too sure what the intentions of the director and the writer were even after watching the making of documentary in the dvd extras br br mike rooker gave this a performance it really didn't deserve i've seen him in other movies much better than this one what would have vastly improved this movie was to throw everything out keep rooker and instead made another entry into the substitute franchise rooker would have made for a terrific substitute teacher who instructs naughty and morally impaired youth regarding the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society br br casper you really shouldn't be just pushing through the like that as you could get poison oak whoops never mind i guess poison oak is the least of your worries now well at least this time your croaking wasn't done by the tail of giant python there are few things more embarrassing than being skewered through the chest by a giant snake at least the death scene in this movie had a bit more dignity to it as well as a more liberal smearing of karo syrup and red food dye nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye br br first time i've seen a monster wear a shiny cape with a fur collar ruff first time for everything i guess just to be nitpicky though if this was an indian ghost how come it looked exactly like a monster out of european culture and folklore wouldn't the monster have been more sort of more br br while i did watch this all the way to the end credits i don't realistically believe that i could in good faith recommend it to others
<START> this is one of my all time favorite movies it's great to watch in groups i find it's also great for any alan rickman fan he does such a wonderful job it's engrossing entertaining very surprising you have to watch it twice at least i haven't watched it with anyone who didn't like it or at least find it worthwhile
<START> when i was growing up voyage into space was my most favorite movie i remember the time when ktla channel 5 ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day i still remember every part of that movie the ending was so sad when giant robot got blown up along with guillotine and then watching johnny with all the tears running down his face calling for giant robot there should have been a sequel to the movie in which giant robot somehow survived the explosion i can't believe that there are so many other voyage into space fans still out there i really want to buy the movie when it comes out on dvd but my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie i don't know why they haven't released it yet since it's been over 40 years now i think voyage into space was made back in 1968 only now my second favorite japanese monster movie of all time the war of the is finally coming to dvd and being released on sept 9th and i can't wait now if only they would do the same with voyage into space giant robot johnny and voyage into space will never be forgotten in my eyes and probably many others too it will always be a childhood classic to me
<START> after many many years i saw again this beautiful love story thinking about how would i half a century after react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women's behaviors in a small city in brazil br br this time however what caught my attention in the film was something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr han jennifer jones makes clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition as an eurasian in fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provided that by doing so she is not betraying her chinese side its seems to the spectator that is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them br br therefore attitudes always leave poor elliott Â a determined brave and extremely practical man Â anxious and perplexed without knowing how much importance to give to her words for him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear if we love each other let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together not so fast is what she seems verbally and non verbally to answer him all the time br br in fact chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism and as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind namely the constant raids on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non physical world for is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and concrete threat as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the of a japanese invasion but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings br br in fact it looks like a whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people's life totally miserable because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon peasants are advised that they should shout loudly the rice is bad the rice is bad to protect their crops from being stolen by deities and in a funeral it is recommended that the dead's family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods don't take advantage of their sorrow and fragility br br in other words introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone's daily life br br as the story takes place in hong kong in 1949 it should be clear that china really was at that time almost a semi feudal society while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the usa after the first oil shock in 1973 took charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both sides of eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today br br a lot of history came into being since those old days as to china the main fact is that after several phases of a communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism and what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled in hong kong in 1949 and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it is gone completely gone in brief if that story took place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talking business as usual
<START> saw the film at it's lawrence kansas premiere this wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful it fails for many reasons bad acting bad script no clear point but mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves hey i have some money so let's make a movie without really thinking it out sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality they just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie or in this case even a watchable one with this film i do not feel ashamed to say that if i didn't know some of the crew i would have walked out simple as that
<START> bled is a very apt title for this as you watch it you will feel your life being bled from you the clichÃ© in horrors is about people doing exactly what they shouldn't going down into the basement or going up into the attic then the trouble ensues take heed then don't watch this film show the brains that victims in horror movies never do stay clear do not enter and if you need anymore incentive this film is as bad as the worst uwe boll film i mean the house of the dead bad i have often thought about entering a review of a film on i m d b and after watching some based on the comments herein i discovered i guess everyone's to his her opinion please trust me on mine
<START> a rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films john huston's beautiful farewell to life and the movies is almost entirely true to the narrative and the spirit of james joyce's short story a tender meditation on love death and time expressed in the events of a twelfth night party in middle class dublin circa 1910 unpromising as the material might appear the film succeeds by its willingness to tell the story on its own quiet apparently inconsequential terms rather than force a conventional cinematic shape of plot points and dramatic incidents upon it only once is the wrong note struck when old miss julia a trained singer and music teacher whose voice is supposed to have been cracked by age not shattered sings so badly that the audience burst out laughing when i saw this at the cinema fortunately the mood of hushed and gentle melancholy is re established in plenty of time for the moment of revelation between the married couple gabriel and gretta conroy in a hotel bedroom as snow begins to fall outside it's a sad story i suppose but the kind that leaves you feeling better not blue especially recommended as a date movie for people in love who aren't frightened of confronting the sweetness and sadness of life
<START> contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on pbs but never got a chance to watch it probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5 6 hrs of masterpiece theater with its bbc made for tv production style no music settings all in one room no outdoor scenes flat tv look but after watching the movie traffic which i thought was pretty good at that time i couldn't help digging up the tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra 2 1 2 hr br br boy was my preconceptions wrong about this tv series it is so much more involving than traffic the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable and the whole subplot involving pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain from the farmer to the end user in traffic the pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot br br there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance same with social issues which in were conveyed realistically w o sounding preachy whereas in traffic the characters jus t blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv issue of the week movies br br there was no bad guy vs good guy in even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the nobody messes with me type of person in traffic br br the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this it was hard not to compare scene by scene and even though the scenes were not the same i knew what the outcome was going to be already thank god for the pakistan story which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w o thinking which scene it compares to although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which helen brought back to germany as in the storyline of traffic thank god was not that hokey and far fetched
<START> norma had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful ingenues but her first talkie cast her as a brassy showgirl in the trial of mary dugan and she came through with flying colours from then on her sweet and lovely ingenues were cast aside and she in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills let us be gay was made before but released after the divorcÃ©e and was an unusual twist on the upper crust dramas that shearer made her own br br norma first appears without make up as frumpish kitty brown who's main purpose in life is to pander to her very unappreciative husband bob rod la rocque she is hurrying to get him off to his golf game but in reality he is going to see his mistress when helen the mistress comes to the house for a showdown kitty faces the situation with civility but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and bob leaves for good br br three years later mrs courtland brown kitty comes to stay as a house guest of the eccentric mrs marie dressler kitty is now a knockout and has a job for her she wants kitty to romance a house guest who in his turn is romancing her grand daughter diane beautiful sally shock horror the man is none other than bob her ex husband kitty carries off the meeting with sophistication and witty repartee there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man and no one is the wiser br br the film then settles down into one of those early very talkie boring drawing room comedies kitty casts a spell over all the men and bob is desperate to start again the women have all the strong roles in this film men are just puppets raymond hackett seems to be in the film as an extra butler pass me a cushion get me a drink move this chair instead of diane's harassed fiancÃ© norma shearer is of course the whole show marie dressler adds to her list of eccentric portrayals and sally is a real eyeful as the gorgeous diane
