<START> cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death in attempt to get a hopefully temporary view of the afterlife certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark and the acting occasionally goes over the top but the underlying message about god's and others' forgiveness for our real or perceived sins is positive and unique in cinema and the cast is very very good the last sequence between julia roberts and her father is so effectively done that years after having seen it i still get chills thinking about it highly recommended
<START> cult film maker rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns of which i'm only left with what am i doing in the middle of the revolution 1972 to catch is one i only became aware of fairly recently via marco guide it's an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece the great silence 1968 complete with desolate snowy landscapes br br johnny the french elvis presley whom i first saw in jean luc godard's detective 1985 is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti hero hud who like clint eastwood's the man with no name from sergio leone's celebrated dollars trilogy is fitted with a steel plate armor for protection incidentally i had stunning daughter laura at the 2004 venice film festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director claude chabrol is another curious addition to the fold serving pretty much the same function that frank wolff did in the great silence but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing francoise fabian the latter then plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals sylvie has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by and who at one point is into free love by apache gabriella with this is mind it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both fabian and incidentally the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long haired youths who also engage in dope smoking and revolutionary talk is a somewhat half baked attempt at contemporary relevance Â but it all eventually adds to the fun besides even the black barmaid sports an afro hairdo br br mario too enjoys himself tremendously with the role of a larger than life mexican bandit nicknamed el diablo Â who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side an element which may have influenced clint eastwood's unforgiven 1992 and at one point challenges the captive to a head butting duel having mentioned this the film also contains one very unusual of death' Â as disposes of an adversary by kicking the cash register of the saloon into his face as always the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by over emphatic sound effects equally typically for the genre however the wistful score by angelo francesco emerges a most significant asset actually the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film's generally somber tone Â after fabian's comeuppance at the hands of the locals the hippies who had previously idolized hud suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town forcing everyone on the street and unclothed Âbut the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge they however scurry away at the prospect of facing him and then rides out of town leaving behind br br in conclusion i acquired this via a good quality widescreen print in italian albeit with french credits and the occasional lapse Â about one minute of screen time in all Â into the french language where apparently the original soundtrack wasn't available
<START> this is by far and away the stupidest thing i have ever seen on celluloid i mean we started watching it assuming it was a skinemax t a flick but aside from a couple boobs that was it i mean i get the point of making stupid movies in order to show some sex scenes as they are the sole reason for a movie of that kind to be made this movie however has no sex scenes and really has no point at all there is no linear time the scenes travel around like a fart in the wind people show up for no reason then leave and it is never explained the plot is never advanced and nothing happens i have never been as flabbergasted at how bad a movie was until i saw this has the director even been to a film school has he ever seen a movie i don't know but from the looks of it he seems to have made some moron proud with this piece of crap as he is still working i literally walked away from this movie dumber but i still recommend watching it as it should be shown in every film school of the country as an example in what not to do when making a film move over plan 9 from outer space you have a new contender for worst movie ever made
<START> hilarious and low budget comedy at it's best this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy kids in the hall be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines filled with ethnic slurs and awful language sex toys included br br there should be more comedy like this around today this collection of sketches on one dvd will warrant many viewings and in order to appreciate some of the parts if you enjoyed the state and or wet hot american summer get ready for some more glory if you are even considering this for younger audiences i would say that every child on earth should see this
<START> if you watched this film for the nudity as i did you won't be disappointed i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was i think h o t s has to be the best of its genre br br it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times br br i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day br br it is a shame that the dvd doesn't have any extras but as they didn't have dvds when this was filmed that is understandable i would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end
<START> the other lowest rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday omnibus my god it's depressing like all soaps it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot on if anyone lived in a social environment like this they'd slash their wrists within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more than you'll ever see here take my advice avoid this nadir of the british tv industry it is evil
<START> i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time it has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes which are in it in all the 3 schneider movies without a doubt several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on schneider's way of seeing things by the way helge schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the jazz in germany maybe europe he is mostly inspired by the great m davis and t monk so if you do not like him it is ok but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid cheap boring or not funny because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of h schneider you would have to surrender
<START> 'captain is a fantastic film in itself it is nothing like the book which may its ardent followers yet viewed on it's own the film is a masterpiece the views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either nicolas cage was brilliant so different from his usual action hero type characters penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together i think that this film has to be judged as an project not related to the book louis de gave up rights to the film script so the film is an interpretation of the director john go and see this film with an open mind you'll love it because underneath is the touching story of love and war
<START> i've slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of them br br next to the soft skin coincidentally staring deneuve's sister the late francoise this would have to be my favourite truffaut film br br as well as directing truffaut also wrote the screenplay something that always strikes me about truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story one could almost call it naivety br br there's a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot he rings the and deneuve answers wearing a negligee in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street deneuve changes into her dress puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep it's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child but that's truffaut for you br br watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch incidentally for those fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film indeed a sinful pleasure br br i disagree with previous posters i see nothing about the film at all as for the 'look' of it i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's it certainly gives films of this period a unique look br br highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans
<START> this is the only pauly shore movie you should ever see o k it's the only one i've ever seen and i think i've made good choices i normally find shore's shtick kind of tired but he is very funny in this movie actually the script is pretty funny and shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his what do you call it tomfoolery anyway this is a funny if ultimately forgettable film 3
<START> dead man's bounty the film's american title has the look and feel of a classic italian western the cinematography costumes and sets look great the cast is rugged not a pretty face among them at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster br br the script was perfectly dreadful there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama br br despite looking great the cast spoke english with heavy european accents that were often unintelligible br br the final nail in it's coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who's featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant br br the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man continuing his recent string of doa performances
<START> on the surface appears to be yet another generic high school drama but surprisingly hidden away underneath is immense amounts of depth originality and eccentricities that will not only render it unforgettable to the viewer but also makes it indisputably one of the best animes that the medium has produced in the last few years br br we see the world through the eyes of who on his first day of high school meets a girl that boldly claims to the rest of the class she has no interest in 'normal humans' and to top it off casually invites any aliens time travellers sliders or to meet up with her stares in disbelief wondering if shes joking or has a few screws loose however defying his gut instincts he begins talking to her in doing so it soon becomes apparent she isn't some ordinary high schooler not to long after she creates her own aptly named school club and drags amongst other highly unfortunate people to attend br br nothing in this anime conforms to the usual standard conventions the protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and contributes a witty narration to the show a far cry from the usual 2d male leading characters that tends to populate the medium the episodes themselves are not chronological and forces the viewer to think about the events unfolding and how they relate to prior instances this is a stroke of genius the effect is like a jig saw puzzle as a new piece is layed we get more of a sense of the bigger picture previous scenes are now given entire new meanings and the realization of them are profoundly satisfying this does mean however that it feels dis jointed its anything but a very cleverly written script has bypassed this problem and ensured that it flows smoothly from start to finish br br the story itself is strikingly original but i won't delve further than the simple bare bones plot outline i gave earlier as it will no doubt spoil it for you however what i will mention is the plot incorporates a vast array of genres ranging from comedy to sci fi how they managed to accomplish this in the space of fourteen episodes is beyond me and no doubt a huge achievement in itself br br is a true gem which has such diversity and depth that it will appeal to pretty much anyone with an interest in anime watch it rather unusually this is something that lives up to the enormous hype that it has received and even exceeds it
<START> bottom at its absolute highest perfection who ever says slap stick comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong not that this film will only appeal to those who are of a masculine nature this is another quality british dark comedy with many many jokes not violence related but it helps if you can let your senses go and laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all br br this is a true example of thriving british ingenuity and homegrown talent hats off to them on a performance level it reminds me very much of the early works of the marx brothers where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion are present in their acting styles resulting in a performance where the audience can really engage the innate human desire to see others suffer yet to be detached and still feel safe much like the principle many tv chat shows operate on a truly marvelous bit of manipulation leaving all parties feeling better off
<START> okay i'll say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for me br br for example anne to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darling br br if that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2
<START> hi y'all br br i bought this on dvd from england you see i have one of those multi region players i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends well surprise to amy jo johnson she's barely in the movie although she is on the cover it's really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place perhaps someone has a trust fund br br oh it's about vampires who live at the beach
