<START> after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident her young betty is brought to the forefront that's very lucky for her with one problem she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch what is his connection to the opera and what is his fascination with betty br br i love dario argento with every part of my body and i'm not an orthodox fan i think many people particularly critics praise his earlier work suspiria and deep red but really frown on later films such as sleepless which i liked my favorite phenomena is usually vastly underrated opera tends to fall somewhere in between some consider it one of his last great films others see it as part of his so called decline i loved it br br the picture is crisp the music is great unlike other critics i love the metal soundtrack the female lead is someone i can feel for not unlike jennifer connelly from phenomena and the imagery wonderful great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes the concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink brilliant my assistant tina thinks this looked fake but even if it does the idea is more than enough to pay off and some great effects like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth awesome br br jim harper calls the film stunning and calls attention to the innovative cinematography well constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders i agree with this completely one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story mike mayo likewise calls it visually fascinating eye candy and the crisp editing and flowing camera work it's really a wonder that this is not one of argento's more highly praised works br br argento returned to the opera with phantom of the opera which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian sands even more interesting this same year offered the release of michele soavi's which like opera has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation both are great films with soavi's more on the slasher side actually served as second unit director on opera you can make your own conclusions br br my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious they are not as frequent as they should be the first one takes over a half hour and then we get down times between them the lead actress should be in constant terror but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again not cool dario we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high
<START> my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline i was never completely lost but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot br br if it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldn't be much good the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what followers do or believe the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesn't do anything useful with them br br bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons not unwatchable but also not worth watching
<START> i strongly dislike this show i mean like basically everyone at that school is perfect and rich and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school isn't that just a little weird anyways jamie lynn spears cannot act she always has the same facial expression which really annoys me she is basically emotionless and all the guys seem to like her br br and shouldn't chase tell her he likes her its not that hard really none of this show is real life and she isn't a girl like me because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school do not have designer clothes and do not live by the beach br br fake fake fake
<START> if you've never been this is the troma movie to see first amazing acting supercharged soundtrack and bust a gut humor blend perfectly with troma's unique brand of storytelling and special effects despite straying from a word for word retelling of romeo and juliet the fact that it stays in iambic pentameter gives you the odd feeling that it's closer to shakespeare than that overdone music video with dicaprio and danes i assumed i'd seen the ultimate shakespearian comedy when the cast of moonlighting overhauled the taming of the shrew but nothing comes close to tromeo and juliet i strongly recommend the dvd version which contains a second audio track with director lloyd kaufman which is just as entertaining as the main track
<START> this train wreck begins with brujo and alma crossing the mexican border alma is suffering from some horrid curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and nickelodeon every few minutes as well as clench her teeth and mutter nonsense so apparently alma has this uncle in los angeles who knows of a cure for her they hop aboard a train to get there and luckily a friend of theirs pays their way alma and brujo stay in the luggage cart the whole movie since they can't afford upper class seats meanwhile in the higher class we see a bunch of nobodies on their way to la for whatever reasons a balding guy on a business trip two girls one of whom is carrying 5 grand and a wad of cocaine three stoners and some mexicans the mexicans rough it up with brujo and try to take his weed which apparently is a sedative for snakes inside her they realize that the snakes don't attack they enter your body through your veins very twisted and b movie brujo saves the guy by ripping out his heart temple of doom style and procuring the snake for some reason he cannot have the snakes harmed or it'll hurt alma while this is going on a narcotics expert tries to bust one of the girls and gets a little action topless in exchange for not telling about her shipment of drugs a mystery guy shows up and has a gunfight with him as a grand finale alma turns into a vampire bites her man and then becomes a giant pathetic excuse for a cg snake the size of the train eats the train and is blasted into a nuclear bomb hurricane whirlwind and disappears everyone then heads to la on foot br br the credits actually say at the end any similarity to actual persons living or dead or actual events is purely coincidental and very weird we suggest moving and or taking a plane odd since a line in the movie from the bald guy is yeah i hate planes the credits go on to say no snakes were hurt during the production of this screenplay only a small child but it's cool there actually were a lot of real snakes used in the movie and all of them very tame there is actually no scene of cg snakes attacking anyone unless you count the large one but then it just eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and it looks like a muppet the snakes don't really attack anything they're just there one crawls out of toilet paper actually br br the movie isn't funny isn't scary as there's no real snake attack and is just a cash in' which is when a low budget movie company hears about a big budget hollywood release then they rush to put out a similar film or even a parodic version for release just prior to or simultaneously with the big name flick the effect of this being that many people will either confuse one for the other and go see the quickie rather than the or they will want to see both for whatever reason like myself avoid at all costs
<START> any gun can play 1967 directed by enzo g castellari is a very good pastiche of spaghetti westerns especially leone's the first half is great which apart from the opening which is a direct nod to for a few dollars more with colonel douglas mortimer and el walking into a ghost town and then promptly killed by a bounty hunter called the stranger is entirely serious with great gunfights especially the train robbing scene fast and furious action and nice performances from gilbert roland george hilton and who manages well considering that he is badly miscast edd byrnes but then when the film reaches the half way mark there is a jokey fist fight between hilton and byrnes it isn't very funny and is the weakest part of the film but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light you realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of spaghetti western conventions and in retrospect the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent what now follows is a more obvious parody with even some acrobatic jumping around from that predates all those seventies circus westerns the ending a complete send up of the good the bad and the ugly climax is very well done as in other hands it could have been very silly so a pretty fun spaghetti western that doesn't take itself too seriously i would recommend it to anyone who likes spaghetti westerns
<START> great book poorly done movie cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore fest flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category no doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong the very talented gretchen mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue feels like everyone just phoned it in even the makeup mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film looks amateurish and crude don't waste your time on this clunker go read the book
<START> the word honor should be erased from the of all nations it aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment br br as can be expected with these screenwriters yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless redundant and downright silly contrary to other reviewers i found robert mitchum's performance not very good this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age he looks like a tired janitor it does not go too well with the part and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest ken and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young intelligent feeling thug respectively br br the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy things are set in motion by the mitchum character's asking the character a favor based on wrong assumptions the error quickly becomes evident but the sense of honor demands they must not back off so they start sneaking around shooting in all directions wielding swords and wrecking their friend's arty apartment although the guy pleads with them it please all through the corresponding fight bodies start piling up and the story ends with mitchum's character making his point if you give him your little finger i will give you mine well it's the least he can do can't he so he pulls out a knife takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity outside the frame luckily it was a moment which probably should have been solemn it just made me laugh br br the use of locations is very good in this movie i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on lake an interesting futuristic building by architect the kyoto protocol was signed there to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney pollack's more recent documentary sketches of frank o which is about architecture and nothing else
<START> trite and unoriginal it's like someone watched immortal beloved and amadeus and decided to mix them together and in the process steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one as with most historical movies nowadays there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story which is understandable for the most part for example during the remaining days of beethoven's life it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them that of course would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen the script although filled with some quotable lines doesn't quite capture the feel of that time period and coupled with some bad acting seems rather contemporary diane kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft ed harris doesn't work for me as beethoven and i mostly blame gary oldman for that overall not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life better just find yourself a copy of immortal beloved br br http multiply com reviews
<START> this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it all the characters are decent i guess but the story is so so however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together and it was very boring a lot of times however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining and had some good stunts i have not yet seen the hong kong version however i'm sure it's better then this dud plus the twist is very predictable it's really lifeless and bland and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable the opening is supposed to be memorable but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it plus i really didn't root for any of the characters this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans the direction is terrible james glickenhaus does a terrible job here with extremely bland camera work bad angles and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout the acting is so so jackie chan is amazing as always however he is not his usual energetic self and looks bored and ps ed off throughout the film had zero chemistry with danny aiello and i really don't blame him either jackie rules danny aiello is ok here as jackie's partner but his character is a bit of an ass and he had zero chemistry with jackie he did ok i guess roy is decent as the main villain but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing he still is damn cool though rest of the cast are average at best overall not worth your time or money 1 2 out of 5
<START> ok i watched this movie someone needs to kick me why must the olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture this was another movie of watching the olsen twins travel to an exotic location meet some cute guys look pretty and have everyone drooling over them the direction the plot development ugh the acting i don't know about the u s but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to hop onto the bike of a guy u met like 10 minutes back though i'm now convinced that these girls will never learn to act i really hope that one day we'll get to watch a movie with an original even slightly plausible plot
<START> this film tries very hard to be an action film but it fails miserably br br steve guttenberg plays the head of an elite counter terrorist team that fails in attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent br br the story the acting the special effects all fall flat br br definitely a must avoid

<START> talk radio sees a man somewhat accidentally stumble through life indeed the american dream from whatever bog standard and everyday job he has in a store to presenter of a local radio show before going right the way through to the same job only later syndicated nationwide it's a role he adopts out of his own aggression and natural mannerisms a frothing mad approach to freedom of speech as he attacks just about everyone and everything even those that often call up to agree with him or compliment him his role as a man that rants on all things good evil right wrong political religious moral and immoral is something that people seem to take to in one form that of 'it's entertaining and worth tuning in for' but additionally on a plane of rejection and antagonism Â two things born out of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional working life in the western world this towards a man as he gets to the very top of his game by way of the american dream and dealing in freedom of speech as people take to a man but do anything but take to what it is he says br br talk radio begins with a montage of tall towering buildings in a business based area of dallas texas the skyscrapers are shot from a ow angle and tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general vicinity as this voice of one man tears through the images belting out statements and information on items as these monolithic buildings dominate out screen they are the very physical representation of capitalism while the voice of what we learn to be a radio dj is the oral representation of the free west personal speech and opinions on anything and everything stone will finish his film in the exact same manner in which he started it although the film is anything but a circular journey of any sort as the characters undergo monumental changes in both what they witness and their general livelihood rather the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed the ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist people subscribe to them but it does them more harm than good before the re establishment that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in churning out the sorts of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things br br the dj is barry a man with a radio show on a local texan station dealing with just about anything somewhat carefree attitude to some pretty explosive content is established when he flies from one call with a bigoted man whom recently visited a holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend has supposedly overdosed and onto both the berating and mocking of a pizza shop to us the content comes across as quite shocking to these people everything seems to be business as usual which plants some serious seeds of both doubt and horror within the minds of us the newcomers to all of this br br what barry's show is about nobody ever seems to really establish everything and nothing indeed time is taken in the form of either jingles or dialogue that the shows immediately pre and post show are on specific subjects gardening for instance and are hosted by calm speaking and methodical people whom i'm sure do not flit from one random or extreme to another all the time raising the stakes one wonders what barry's jingle is the kind that plays around about lunch time during someone show coming up later the barry show featuring the village idiot and psychotic drug abusers indeed his show's introductory piece carries a matter of fact tone a shouting at the audience as a loud rock track accompanies it br br barry's success arrives in the national syndication proposal it's born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him the furthering of the material and the upping of the stakes ought to call into question just how far they think they can take this and whether this progressing down a track for sake of entertainment is really worth it it is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that barry seems to come unstuck for the first time in his broadcasting life when a supposed serial rapist calls in and leaves mostly everyone slightly stunned it's at this point the camera pauses on barry and by way of depth of focus encompasses those same looming towering buildings the film began with which stand outside of the window directly behind barry they remain tall and proud specifically of the ideologies they've been built on and this furtherance of freedom of speech in barry's show nationwide as one man climbs his ladder suddenly clashes with the sort of content that's being offered everything reaches a point too far and that with freedom ought to at least come a sense of clarity rather than a mere revelling br br oliver stone made talk radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film making he had in the late 1980s in this time he produced a series of really well received films in a pretty short space of time beginning with one of my favourite war films in platoon before continuing with the quite brilliant wall street and eventually finishing with 1991's jfk one might even say that this run continued on into the mid nineties with natural born killers talk radio is like its lead character in the sense it's loud booming stark and confrontational it isn't anti capitalism as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is just going too far for sake of popularity and riches talk radio is certainly a film that sticks in the memory
<START> amazing amazing amazing what more can be said jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well some people have complained about his age but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film if anything he looks drastically younger than 40 i only wish a more worthy ophelia could have been found her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part the only real exceptional performances come from jacobi and stewart who is a great claudius the rest of the cast is good but jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay
