<START> another awful movie from hollywood this time a female helps the revolution in a central american country yeah yeah yeah hey lets make a movie without any sense of realism at all i am so sick of movies like this one the actors and actresses are lousy the effects are cheesy and the dialog horrible and suddenly i see john rhys davies as the evil president from gimli to hugo louis ramos i bet he is very proud of this well i shouldn't have expected much of this movie and i didn't and i am glad cause this sucks bigtime i wonder what kind of people who like this movie my guess is younger people aged 12 16 and i guess some people like because of kristin dattilo well i am in neither of those group and i hate it rating 2
<START> i saw heaven ship at the 2006 cinema muto festival in italy what a great movie this danish steampunk saga is the stirring tale of the first trip to mars in an era when wireless hasn't been perfected the spaceship hasn't got a radio and the heroes are brought back from the landing field via even the intertitles are delightful some of them written in rhymed in the original danish br br the actors' performances are laughable largely hand to brow histrionics but the sets are astonishing easily surpassing anything done by georges melies a decade earlier or in die frau im a decade later of course the plot is simplistic the crew consist of seven thin guys and one fat slob guess which one cracks interestingly everyone in this movie except the dubious professor ardently believes in god even the martians br br impressively the scenarists have the sense to acknowledge that a trip to mars is no the title cards establish that it takes the scientists two years to build their spaceship which has an and six months to reach mars during the construction sequence there's one extremely impressive set up which must have been choreographed dozens of workers all hustle through the in different directions with no and no collisions the danish scientists christen their ship excelsior packing materials and set course for mars even though the moon and venus are closer when the ship which flies not vertically lands on mars it is greeted by martians who turn out to be nordic blondes all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians as a highly developed meat eater i resented that part br br conveniently enough mars turns out to have an atmosphere just like earth's as well as equal gravity in an exterior shot of the martian landscape the sun's apparent magnitude when seen from mars is the same as it is when viewed from earth i also couldn't help observing that all the wise elder martians are male in fact female elders are thin on the ground here both the earth born hero and the martian maiden are the martians speak a universal language wear on their robes and greet the earth visitors with a globe of earth which of course they hold with its north pole upward br br that martian maiden is played by an ethereally beautiful danish actress waiter i'll have some of that danish we see a martian dance of chastity which might have been twee or ludicrous but is actually quite touching and beautiful also the martian funeral scene features one shot which reminded me of a sequence in the seventh seal i wonder if ingmar bergman saw this film br br has a few flaws but its production design and its other merits very far outweigh its drawbacks the ole olsen who is named in the credits and who appears in a brief prologue is no relation to chic johnson's vaudeville partner from i would give a 12 but the scale tops off at 10 so a full 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to mars the blonde planet
<START> this isn't a very good movie but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed lloyd kaufman the brains behind troma isn't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema br br in this film we have the titled character luther whose favorite pastime isn't baseball but biting the heads off of chickens receiving his release from lockup the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn't speak he merely like a chicken and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal of course once luther is set free he goes about causing mayhem first at a grocery store and later at a farm house br br violence lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse br br nudity stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture as the former lois lane i can't recall which superman edition she was from gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend a guy who just doesn't have any chemistry with ms haiduk the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy she is quite something br br story whitey screenplay may just be the worst ever written the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window his dialogue is something that a pre schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd it's as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations br br acting the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best
<START> i stumbled across this film while channel surfing and was blown away it was being broadcast on a lesser known short films program here in australia br br it has been a long time since i have been so impressed by a film especially one so short br br the power of the story the quality of the acting and the stunning cinematography wow if it were available it would make a very worthy addition to my dvd collection br br i am undoubtedly impressed and i will look forward to joshua next film br br an exceptional experience 10 10
<START> with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest well written well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters highly informative and very entertaining the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2 and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project the only downside is that this is a british production and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent the skill of current day australian irish actors taking on non native dialects is amazing the storyline is fully consistent with richard definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb sadly the mini series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion br br compares favorably to the more recent 'fat man little boy' feature film with paul newman as leslie the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered and dwight schultz alumnus of tv's 'a team' as oppenheimer as a mini series is around 4x as long as the newman feature but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage
<START> i'm only going to write more because it's required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was you pretty much know who's in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting 'talent' trying hard to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to wonder in this 'mystery' br br the more i write the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest i've ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder what i'm saving votes of 1 and 2 for however i thought this film deserved a 3 since i believe there was some talent in the film johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well the man who played the character that was 'the did well too for his short part br br many of the actors did an 'ok' job but the lead actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for 'the young and the restless' or of our lives' if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on it doesn't help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap although i'm pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and sound editing br br first time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldn't watch it again unless i was paid a large sum of money
<START> assault on precinct 13 3 10 let us forget for a moment that assault on precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie taken completely on its own merits assault is a debacle br br lets start with the rio bravo style scenario about a dozen people are trapped in a decaying police station in detroit if the detroit location is giving you robocop warm and fuzzies stop right now it could have easily said topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed in fact the last bit in the forest would have made more sense surrounding them are our bad guys corrupt cops br br now i know what your thinking corrupt cops were the nazis and drug cartels busy that weekend of course these are no ordinary cops these guys are right of the cover of the latest tom clancy video game yup we have body armor helicopters laser sights night vision goggles the works so we have thirty s w a t members special forces armed to the teeth verses 4 cops drunk mind you it's new years eve 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals br br so how do our heroes defend themselves truth is they can't they all should be dead within ten minutes tops not to mention the characters inside have an annoying habit of walking past the windows now an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan a movie esp a b style action film however with the exception of laurence fishburne and ethan hawke all the other characters seemed to be comic relief at least i hope they were br br while ja rules and leguizamo's characters are bad enough it's minstrel show that takes the cake rarely has a more stereotypical african american character appeared on the modern screen her performance resembles a frat boy in blackface and drag acting ghetto br br in the original assault a gang member takes over an ice cream truck and drives around the neighborhood shooting little girls in the head i have had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks ever since after this assault i have a perfectly rational fear of remakes
<START> as much as 'the beginning' showed that we're still going to get classic x files drive showed that the x files was going to explore new territory they start by giving us a unique teaser to drive with the news camera footage it was an interesting transition from the the tv to the real events i would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 i was thinking am i on the right channel that first autopsy by scully flooded me with big words that i don't understand i think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy silly scully what is the deal with the lighting in the autopsy lab it's as dark as a tomb in there how are they supposed to see what they're doing in there assistant director gets his first lines in this episode i have no love lost for that man he is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate the first two being diana and jeffrey spender i guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for mulder scully and skinner so they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our ire as fans i love the quarantine suits worn by scully and her team with the cool helmet light bulbs boy it's really smoky or foggy in dry northern nevada at night can we say the word effect drive is a cool episode but looking at route 36 on my u s atlas there's no way mulder could've maintained a speed of 70 100 mph on that road if he had been on i 80 the freeway maybe but no way on a state road with that many curves all of the filming inside the car looked very authentic excellent job by rob bowman it looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage this was a fun episode but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode it keeps you on the edge of your seat so hold on for a fast ride
<START> i hate to say i enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment however i was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances it was the kind of film i told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other
<START> one true thing is a very quiet film that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box office it tells the crippled story of ellen renee zellweger a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother meryl streep so that her aloof father william hurt can run his academic department these terms are only general the strength of one true thing lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood clichÃ© territory br br streep is kate the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating hurt's birthday but ellen has never been close to her mother and since she graduated from harvard university has a certain about her ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air head while on the other hand she admires her father who shares a special passion writing ellen writes for an aggressive new york firm and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by hurt who seems to be a very lonely figure br br to get to the point as kate gets sicker ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most and ellen assumes he's having an affair meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's cult group the and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed br br without giving too much away one true thing is a masterpiece in character study streep once again turns in a beautiful performance this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage streep earned her eleventh oscar nomination for this performance hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments but it is renee zellweger who steals this movie forget chicago cold mountain bridget jones's diary or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie she is remarkable in it working within her character's bitter resentment at understanding her parents zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she's screaming inside
<START> it was a very well written movie and the actors had a very exquisite way of portraying all the character but as the movie came to an end i felt as if there was more but they forgot to put it on the dvd maybe they are planning on making a sequel well even if they don't it's a good movie and a good rental but even a better purchase
<START> ugh unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time none of the characters are remotely likable which makes this film difficult to watch they're all miserable thirty year olds who don't take responsibility for their crummy lives i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film so there's a chance things got better afterward but i doubt it i can't imagine five people as self absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years br br three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing as they had no relevance to the plot and were clearly a gratuitous failed attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull film br br save your time and money and skip this movie
<START> actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut the gothic horror frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 u s open where a young american caddy rises from his humble background to play against his idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played i'm no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man but some how this film was enthralling all the same br br the film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of hbo's carnivale and rome but lumbers along slowly for its first by the numbers hour once the action moves to the u s open things pick up very well paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes i loved the rain soaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings there's some compelling character development when the british harry is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the twentieth century br br you know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience
<START> the first time i saw brotherhood of satan i was 12 yrs old i saw it in a little town in central washington state it played before tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the brotherhood of satan all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie the beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station wagon br br what struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around wa where i saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of which is the location of the movie a small town in sw new mexico i have always liked jones and martin and also charles bateman who was on get smart another show i like i gave the movie a 7 and later on when i did get to see tales from the crypt i thought brotherhood of satan was better
<START> this movie is quite bad aggressive not played well not directed well seems low budget low quality weak and disconnected after watching earlier comments went to see it but if u try to compare it with apocalypse now platoon or any others u'r really off the tracks this movie looks like a 60's old and purely made film with cast of grown neanderthals not to mention or actually do not paying attention to details like changing rounds low budget fireworks and all sorts of poorly filmed characteristic is watchable though if like to see it as an early development of the movies document not to go back br br p s afterall the guys are quite alright
