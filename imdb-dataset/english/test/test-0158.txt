<START> this is not a film to impress you with high budget high tech shots fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director but it's a film by a director who is also a very good photographer who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human not as an half god unlike most of the directors this is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best 'performances' with unreal or at best learned gestures and mimics rather it's a film in which they act as real as it can be actually they are not professional actors at all the dialogues between the main characters their expressions their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life you tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words you show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest this is the same feeling of that you get in modern city life and this is your chance to see yourself from outside impersonated by the main characters i saw all of the films of bilge incl his short film thanks to those who puts it in the dvd many would compare him with tarkovsky ozu and maybe bresson or bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur and he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life that is the kind of sincerity you'll find in
<START> is this a good movie it's hard to say but in 1953 for many people it was a remarkably effective movie suspenseful scary and then amazingly actually touching when the old gentleman meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie br br yes what lurks in the maze turns out to be something of a surprise and for a lot of people a hilarious one but the basic idea recapitulates was a very real one at the time the book was written and does have some basis in fact not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie of course br br but working on what must have been a very low budget one of the greatest production designers and the person for whom the term production designer was invented creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling at times of course the movie is very silly but it has its moments
<START> while i read all of the complaints about this movie before i saw it i still had interest from the preview i don't know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what but i really enjoyed the movie the i was not very frightened at all until the second half of the movie but even then it wasn't very bad at all i think that most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic if a little too coincidental but it was necessary to move the story along i think that the house and surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie it is beautiful and huge but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary i also think that the light arrangement worked extremely well because not only did they turn on upon entry but there was no way to keep them on so the house stayed dark outside of the small section jill was in br br speaking of jill i thought her part was acted pretty well at first it wasn't as believable but after a few phone calls it was fine in fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly and finally someone got the fire poker right i can't tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker and it was a nice touch for her to do the same even though she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most br br in regards to the plot holes the movie is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained and part of the mystery is how he got in exactly how long was he watching her how did he get out to kill her friend and when exactly did the gardener die overall i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went it kept my attention and i wanted to see how it ended although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth my only complaint other than the ending was the lack of character development they could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more to give us a taste of her personality and to give us foreshadowing to how she will handle the situation for example the scene where she debates whether to go back for the kids it looks like some scene is missing at the beginning that talked about her only caring about herself or something
<START> loved the story of a guy that tries to get his girl back been there done that so i can relate any way i love the camera work how occasionally the camera gets left on and they are just sitting there talking about the scene or other stuff or how the camera follows him around to find the cast and what not i watched this on ifc sometime last year and i loved it so i told a few of my friends about it and some of them watched it and they too loved it check it out if you can kinda girly but its still a good film i gave it a 10 10 because of two reasons one i can relate but anyone that has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate two its a really creative way to make a film its like you are constantly there right in the middle of filming like i said great film
<START> spoilers ahead my late childhood had two cinematographic icons star wars and this film by czech genius karel zeman a jules verne encyclopedia where century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography combined with stop motion and conventional animation verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technology in fact it brings atomic energy into verne's universe in a very and elegant way also and elegant is the demise of the villain with a probably nuclear explosion sending his hat flying over the sea the resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory something very rare today when a lot of films don't seem to know how to end themselves br br i was fortunate to catch this gem in reruns on local tv in the late 70s it enhanced my enjoyment of verne's fiction and of cinema br br 10 out of 10 for karel zeman under appreciated master of imagination
<START> one of the major aspects of vera called little vera in english is that it was the first movie from the soviet union that featured a sex scene albeit a short one the title is important vera is the russian word for faith identifying that punk vera has little faith in the soviet system and as the movie shows there's not much faith to be had in it the opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of nearly a hell on earth when vera's lover sergei moves in with her family it leads to some unexpected events br br like in many russian movies people's names describe their characters for example there's viktor remember that victor means winner all in all this is a good look at the soviet union while it was collapsing and we can see why it was collapsing really good
<START> coming from kiarostami this art house visual and sound exposition is a surprise for a director known for his narratives and keen observation of humans especially children this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions why did he do it was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore br br five 5 long takes consists of you guessed it five long takes they are the title names are my own and the times approximate br br driftwood and waves the camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach ten minutes br br watching people on the boardwalk the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk people walk across the camera frame their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting eleven minutes br br six dogs at the water's edge the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby far away at the water's edge six dogs not doing much just relaxing sixteen minutes br br ducks in line gaggle of ducks the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right i assume that kiarostami released them gradually the last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left i assume kiarostami collected the ducks and re released all at the same time it is not the first time that he deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior eight minutes br br frog symphony oops i mean cacophony for a stormy night the camera stands over a pond at night it's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water it is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon the screen goes dark what remains for us is the cacophony of frogs howling dogs and eventually morning hit me on the head if this was done in a single take i saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization twenty seven minutes br br except for the mildly amusing ducks this exercise in minimalism left me cold a film for kiarostami admirers br br i thought i would rate five a five but four is what it deserves br br the film is dedicated to ozu
<START> i was enticed into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb the movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah so i rented it bad idea this movie was bad on so many levels that i'm glad that i had the option to fast forward the shark itself is ok it's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 i gave it a 2 the acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable i wasn't expecting much but i was continually surprised by this suckfest antonio sabato jr is some kind of biologist or scientist or something i wasn't really paying attention he goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course by the way all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater first of all if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the and stuff are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident the shark theory was advanced by antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against antonio and this young college student horrible actress by the way just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble what is with that unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school i find this a little silly the director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background metal crafting is very important when your on a sub i guess anyway i could go on but i've said too much already bottom line go to your local video store rent this video and then destroy it then send email asking imdb to remove all record of this movie from their site all memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed we can do it if we work together
<START> when you watch the making of with this dvd they tell you what is attempted here they are retelling the bible story of good versus evil trying to preach it to a main stream movie audience in a modern society such as ours this is where the film fails there are way too many sheep depicted in this movie people are too empowered for this type of preaching today br br as far as the acting directing technical functions they are done ok chuck norris actually is ok as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of norris as an angel is no more absurd than tommy smothers was in the 1960's sit com
<START> originally i wrote what was a sarcastic scathing review of this pathetic piece of dung but every time i submitted the review i got this contains a very long word which is not allowed also words that were not misspelled were judged incorrect br br now the word that was judged too long was never identified after numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually i got the sneaking suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically nothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itself but after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled br br the pc police are everywhere
<START> wow not in a good way br br i can't believe people dig this trash most of the shows on television are pretty bad and this has been a running trend for a while now they just keep getting worse but las vegas definitely takes it home what a terrible show br br the actors are a bunch of has been c losers that never went anywhere except james caan who knows what he was thinking when he signed on to this pos so its not their fault that this show sucks they just can't help it blame the producers and the writers i can't believe they shot this and were actually proud enough of their work to air it
<START> as an indie filmmaker i try to at least make a decent film this piece of was beyond low budget it was shot on video and not mini dv at least the look and feel of this was just baaaad i met the director a few years ago at showbiz expo in la and he was talking about that book film making for dummies that he was putting together i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong he could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video the plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards i had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice damn i did buy joyride which was a hell of a movie maybe the director should read real motion picture books on film making and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick maybe he should learn from the masters who made night of the living dead and the evil dead and chain saw massacre just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits this is one video that should have stayed dead i cannot call it a film because he did not use film
<START> what movie is this a horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the bhatt camp the movie emraan hashmi and dino the movie has no base it just goes like this dino an are married and living in a rich mansion however dino doesn't like to the heart as he wants only her wealth he loves someone else tara sharma so he bribes emraan to have an affair with so that he could catch them and finally split up with how boring however emraan falls in love with and vice versa lastly when gets imprisonment for killing emraan dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly so she lends all her wealth to dino finally dino comes out of the police station and goes with tara with all the wealth what a fraud the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie now the individual ratings out of 5 emraan 1 2 dino 1 2 overall acting 1 2 direction story music 1 2 final rating 1 2 poor performances and poor casting music good i rate the movie 1 5 10 dont waste your time
<START> believe it or not this was at one time the worst movie i had ever seen since that time i have seen many more movies that are worse how is it possible therefore to be fair i had to give this movie a 2 out of 10 but it was a tough call
<START> i liked this movie unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well you also get to know the two detectives hunting them the killers are two high school kids they are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the perfect crime we all know this crime will not turn out perfect what we don't know is if they will be caught or may be just one of them or even none in a way i kind of hoped they both would get away with it although i don't know if this was the movies intention br br the story is told in a nice way you are starting to get to know the people involved the character of sandra bullock is likable but has her own secret which works against her ben chaplin is pretty good as sam and the two kids are both great the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie br br i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think for a nice evening with a movie 'murder by is a good one
