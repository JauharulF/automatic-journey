<START> what i wouldn't do to give this film a re write extra disappointing due to the great beginning solo sabe degenerates into a mess of superstitious bull after the halfway point and ends on a note so ludicrous soppy and melodramatic i couldn't believe i was watching the same movie i started with the film had numerous elements in its favor such as chemistry between diego luna and alice braga so palpable i thought the screen would start sparking a great soundtrack and beautiful locations instead of ending with the heavy handed religious mumbo jumbo the film should have kept the focus on being a frothy road movie with maybe some undertones about fate and superstition vs logic peppered through i understand the director's entire intent with the film was to make it about religion but the fact is that it just didn't work and he threw away so much great stuff from the beginning by doing so
<START> snowball express from the disney studios isn't quite as dated as some of their output from this era there are no hippies or hot rodders just dull as dishwater dean jones inheriting a ramshackle hotel ski resort from a deceased relative when jones and family pull into a sleepy colorado town the folks who give them directions looking like extras from deliverance are curiously vague about the hotel we expect it to look like a one room shanty but actually the accommodations are very nice jones' teenage daughter has a sour look on her face throughout which doesn't prevent one of the local yahoos from leering at her and of course clumsy pop dean jones is a regular on the slopes leading to a lot of pratfalls in the slush perhaps this square scenario might've benefited from some magical whimsy for this script is a frozen stiff from
<START> the filmmakers were clearly on drugs that's the only explanation i have how else do you explain this travesty of a jane austen adaptation northanger abbey is a parody of a gothic novel but this film was made as if it were a gothic novel the bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug induced hallucinations rather than a naive innocent girl with an overactive imagination as catherine of the novel is br br the actress who played catherine just stands around bug eyed all the time peter firth looks at least 10 years too old to play henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me i don't see the attraction between him and catherine john portrayal was rather odd but isabella actually wasn't that bad but nothing could save this piece of crap movie one more thing this film invents a character not in the book a french friend of general the why exactly they added her is beyond me must have been the drugs she is scary looking beyond belief with white foundation red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face dimples br br you'd think this would at least be entertaining in a so bad it's good quality but unfortunately it's not it's just bad
<START> a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere one had a flat tire the other's jeep mysteriously won't start one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend they come across nice mr who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down hermit like house which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warns them about davy his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there of course one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again is it is it davy the mannequins tourist trap has the usual horror requirements jiggly big girl goody two shoes girl curiosity getting the better of people and never working out but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending i started to feel sorry for chuck is a terrific creepy over the top performance at a point in the film and you almost see the character of molly doing the same this is a gem if you can find it i had taped it off of cable when i was younger and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced but well worth it fans of tanya roberts won't be disappointed either best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup and crackers br br i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain
<START> i first saw love in limbo playing late on free to air tv about five years ago and since then it's a movie i'll always remember warmly as one of those films you see and are forever influenced by br br for the uninitiated australian film has a long history of making off beat comedies about lovable losers and love in limbo is a sterling example of this whilst russel crowe is the only name actor in it although these days he's all a movie needs the rest of the aussie cast is good he still steals the show as a nervous nerdy virgin loser though br br the general premise is a lot like american pie a group of friends wanting to get laid and become men as you'd expect the entire movie on this with a sub plot about the lead's mother and various other incidents and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet ending br br if you enjoyed american pie don't expect this to be the same but expect the same conventions to make appearances love in limbo isn't a gross out romantic comedy but it definitely has its share of laughs fist pumping moments when the good guy wins and the situations every guy australian or otherwise can relate to br br see it if you liked american pie almost famous strengths good aussie cast easy to relate to good value weaknesses predictable at points my rating 8 out of 10
<START> this movie was by far the best ever i think whoever shot it with the sony hand held camera was a genius and the special effects were spectacular especially the chicken breast heart thank goodness this movie only cost me a dollar to rent also the green toxic boob discharge was amazing i could have shot this movie with my friends in high school i would not recommend this movie to anyone you might want to kill yourself instead of watching it i also feel like this was a move for porn stars trying to make it into the legitimate movie business give it to her
<START> this movie isn't even good enough for the 1 bin at the grocery store br br i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it guess he couldn't be too about his roles during this time br br the movie in itself was hard to sit through it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline the guys night out had to be the most boring i've ever seen one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry even the arguments were hard to follow most of the acting lacked any depth br br i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark
<START> i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satya br br when i watched ab tak 56 for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own 'satya' now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine br br ab tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems non existent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall br br but for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues i'm afraid i'll end up re writing the entire script of the movie br br the movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as sub inspector imtiaz and so is as joint commissioner hrishita bhatt mohan and kunal have small roles which they play to perfection as the rookie was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster Â oh my god he learns under the tutelage of and firmly believes in him br br as is impressive his conversations with are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster br br not that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i've ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way his tea Â it's almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country it's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one br br last but in no way the least amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to bollywood if he can do that i'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years
<START> i'll put this as plainly as possible for those of you unaware of bill legacy he was quite simply the greatest stand up comedian in the world almost certainly in my opinion the greatest that ever lived his stand up idol being the great richard pryor whose battles with addiction he paralleled his death in 1994 went barely noticed in the popular media coming just weeks after kurt cobain had committed suicide his tragic death at such a young age eclipses any sense of the injustice that he was criminally ignored during his life of course but the harsh truth is clear as day nobody has stepped up to claim his mantle there is not a stand up comedian alive with nearly the skill and invention br br the observation is made in the affectionate tribute it's just a that stand up comedians often view the job as a stepping stone to richer pursuits lame movies and morally driven sitcoms made to occupy but never enrich the lives of an unimaginative audience it's everything that bill hicks spoke against his sermon was always a rallying cry for people think for themselves to authority to come together as one race br br his appeal continues to grow with every passing year since his death his star will continue to shine long after so many lesser lights have blew out once you've been exposed to his brilliant intelligent but ultimately compassionate output you will be enriched and rewarded br br the man himself was fond to quote dylan to live outside the law you must be honest' he said bill hicks was honest beyond that he was the funniest of them all
<START> this is truly a funny movie his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall i thought the i am gay scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic though it was funny while watching it for the third time i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed one was when matt dillon's girl friend a classic ditz tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before kevin klein made this film successful along tom selleck this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds she proved that she can be funny she confirmed this in the tv series 'will and grace ' one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren ambrose of feet fame she sticks out with her red bangs but it is obvious that this is one of her first films bob newhart is also very funny at the high school principle
<START> yes dumb is the word for this actress i know many have mentioned her beauty but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her bleached hair lip gloss and not so perfect body watch her walk away in those jeans showing a rather large butt her butt spreads beyond her shoulders what does that tell you as for the leading man played by gorgeous mark humphrey he was perfectly cast a charmer however he and lancaster just didn't match she was out of place opposite this good looking guy good acting by susan glover as the sister angela had a small role and was okay but the film's director philippe gagnon wasted too much footage on lancaster after a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability and what a bitch of a wife she was snooping on her husband being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat was happy to see her hit with the dart gun i thought it might be the end of her but alas the script tells us otherwise after torturing myself and watching this loser again i still came up with the same criticism lancaster is boring to watch this time around her hair folks her hair constantly in her face constantly tossing it back became annoying i question the writer alexandra reason why a good looking wealthy man like philippe would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like allison when there were so many attractive intelligent women with class to choose he picks this nothing is this the rochester jane eyre thing oh well it's all a matter of taste i guess this sarah lancaster is not my cup of tea folks
<START> and you'd be right black mama white mama also known as 'women in chains ' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b movie that the premise suggests pam grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximum security prison it's not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line 'em and get 'em wet ' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman's fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like br br the prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it's a girls gone wild shoot then they all hang out together in their dorm openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape i've never been to prison myself but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange and no pants go figure that say prison on the back must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that can't afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms br br and as is to be expected a prison that can't afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other br br the conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that lee daniels pam grier spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison i won't go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner and the cops are after both of them all the while br br spoilers so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to revolutionize life as they know it meanwhile karen just wants to get off the island something she's been trying to do for years and isn't it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals so we get this odd couple pairing and since they are an odd couple it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end br br in a movie with so many conflicting interests especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie not about to leave anyone unsatisfied they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie where everyone shoots machine guns at each other killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat nice br br even better at the end of the movie after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful awful special effects and we learn that he will be a major before dinner not a bad way to end the movie the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit but here is the last line in the film Â 'it's better to win isn't it ' br br is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major because he figured that out
<START> rififi directed by jules dassin is in line with the melville crime pictures particularly bob le and to a point le rouge of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need and was ahead of its time it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters a kind of respect if not for selves than for others a kind of duty that rings well in post ww2 france its actors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about' and from there the story takes off maybe it's because i have a weak spot for heist pictures particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts err actual physical side of how a heist is pulled off br br one of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast i e snatch or done in ways we've seen too many times before dassin like melville years later decided to create practically a silent film of a heist sound effects included the tension that builds up in this scene may not top what melville had in but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum and just as crucial originality to what's been done before there are some kept close ups for example as the safe is being cracked that mark some of the best i've seen from france at that time an added plus for the film aside from the larval stage new wave touch to the film which in the end makes it a little more modern is that the story works so well and differently it becomes completely about character at points and then keeps up the thrills the last ten to fifteen minutes are down right miraculous like with another classic heist picture the asphalt jungle it's not even the last stop that matters but all about how much one will go past the call of duty putting humanism over greed br br you almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its genre with a nifty little musical number as well
<START> it is movie about love violence illegal affairs and romanian tycoons a romanian story combined with an occidental adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern european audiences that have long forgotten about the conservative over film making br br a film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tensed situations as the movie goes on br br a story that impresses because of its view over the hard life from the neighbourhood two young men do illegal car races they work together as a team and prosper from their occupation but when they are asked by a local tycoon to lose one race things start to get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up creating a very movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that br br brilliant acting both by dragos and along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director also give a unique charm to furia all this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race language we speak or country it is a real hope for the romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced occidental cinema br br i hope you enjoy watching it as i'm sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it
<START> this has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it's exposure of the injustices of bigotry billy wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as corby white wolf however felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes this is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring
