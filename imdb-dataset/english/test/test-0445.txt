<START> a wounded tonto standing alone to protect three innocent lives a devious woman a deadly plot racial tension smart indians br br these are things we rarely if ever saw in the tv series but this movie adds them all into the mix while this is most certainly a lone ranger movie it mixes up the formula just enough that those who grew tired of the series would probably still enjoy it definitely recommended for any fan
<START> what is wrong with american movies these days hollyweird keeps making movies that have men acting like women and women acting like men the idiotic male director and writer of this movie need to have their heads examined the main problems with this film are its overt extreme feminist portrayals of the sexes br br in the scenes of the bar eva mendez and her friend are swigging from the beer bottles like you may find sailors on an oil tanker doing so at a bar in iceland mendez continually kisses every girl she sees after that she also dresses provocatively in every scene yet curses like a guy she gets very emotional when she fights with will smith for a while while trying to all women from bad guys everywhere br br the men are no better in this movie what we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything they can to win a date the males in this movie are concerned with getting either sexual favours or unable to speak clearly when face to face with a woman men in real life do not behave this way br br what we see in this movie is a product of culture gone awry everything is flip flopped guys act like girls girls act like guys all this is done while keeping the extreme predilections of the sexes very much a part of the story men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in sex most of the time while women are shown as macho and overbearing but only as a veneer for their emotional insecurities br br this movie would be good if it wasn't presented obnoxiously to the audience the content is not the culprit it is the manner in which the content is presented
<START> spoilers looking for a little more excitement then seeing crocodiles being fed at the local game reserve sisters grace and pat diana glenn together with grace's boyfriend adam andy decide to take a trip upstream in the desolate and deserted of human australian swamps br br with their swamp guide jimmy ben at the helm of his motorized boat the four get by a giant saltwater crocodile who quickly grabs and drags a terrified jimmy down to the bottom along with him grace pat adam end up stranded on a tree in the swamp with pat hanging on for dear life on the boat the rest of the film has the hungry and determined crocodile play a cat and mouse or and human game with the trio that ends in a showdown at a mud bank just where the dead and dismembered body of jimmy finally came to it's rest br br both the director and actors in the film take full advantage of the swamp making it at times far more scary then the giant crocodile swimming in it we get to see the killer crocodile just about a half dozen times in the movie but everyone of them hits you and jimmy grace pat adam right in the gut br br alway there were kept in suspense by the giant reptile always doing his damage from beneath that comes so unexpectedly that it the crock attacks has far more effect when you don't see them coming then like in the last ten minutes of the movie when you do you wonder right from the start who in the end would survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell about them the ending with the crocodile vrs human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part in the film br br the crocodile who was both so cagey and effective in the earlier scenes seemed to have punched or swam himself out not having either the strength or speed to grab with his deadly jaws and finish off the sole survivor of the expedition in fact the killer crock was so ineffective that even after he his victim or victims he just couldn't hold on to them this in the end turned out to be fatal on his part br br a lot like jaws the film black water has the killer crocodile like the great white shark in jaws more interested is killing his human prey then eating them with all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile was only after the quartet grace pat adam jimmy for invading his watery domain that he felt was the grand ruler of and for daring to do that they were to pay with their lives
<START> it does not surprise me that this short 91 minutes b w movie that was made 50 years ago in the soviet union during the short period called or the thaw has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world it is sublime and beautifully filmed some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time sergei camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated the film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman it is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for it is about forgiveness and about hope the film received absolutely deservingly the grand prix at cannes film festival and tatiana was chosen as a recipient of a special award at cannes for playing veronika the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie after separation with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent br br for me the movie is very personal and dear because i was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning i walked the same streets squares and bridges over the river every family in the former soviet union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger cold and illnesses during wwii and my family is not exception my mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books cranes are flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply it is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life my background my memory and my past
<START> this is a fair movie good for one off viewing the plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasent surprise as is the acting which although a little hammy is better than normal for these types of flick br br the 'special effects' are hilarious a translucent giant and a blatantly polystyrene papier mache hand wobbling unconvincingly on a bit of wire br br definitely to watch once for kitsch entertainment value br br 5 10
<START> this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about br br the story in general is not that bad based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gang's girl they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re written it but as mentioned above with not nearly as much intensity br br the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down br br this film has nothing on once were warriors br br low budget alright story poor acting nothing to write home about
<START> this is unique in films of hitchcock's that i've seen in that i didn't really enjoy it br br in fact i actually found this quite predictable and annoying br br cary grant and joan fontaine are a newly married couple he's the kind of lovable rogue character that you've seen in many films without ever being lovable as far as i am concerned br br in fact it was a barely believable relationship at best and at times seemed particularly false and implausible br br unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back br br fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for and presumably what her late father was worth br br average and rather uninteresting all round actually but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date
<START> let's get things straight i was raised catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home that was useful for two things to make a convinced atheist out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas and i say if a catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he can report it to the police even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards he can not reveal what he's told in confession but he can talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut so here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie and another lie is there's no absolution for murder according to the catholic church there's absolution for any sin as long as there's sincere repentance so far the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller br br as people frequently say this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro's weakest performances in the untouchables and bates' features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past but above that i think the film would have been much better had real life ulster native liam neeson back then mostly unknown to big audiences played mickey rourke's part not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but he'd make us believe the character as real something rourke just can't back in the 80s rourke was not a bad actor afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks but he was one of those performers like brad dourif who's as good as the director he works with and as a former ira terrorist rourke's acting comes across more like a pimp sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi's enjoyable darkman and superstardom in 1993 with schindler's list while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has been liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of but just can't carry this movie along as the lead yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable fare br br ironically enough the often criticized score by underrated composer bill conti worked for me i didn't find it overly melodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful it reminded me of howard shore's score for the silence of the lambs here's to mike talent who made get carter yes but don't forget he's the mastermind behind flash gordon as well br br it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just don't glue and a director's cut is waiting to see the light ok but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as we'll still have the bad casting and the false premise there 4 10
<START> i first saw all the rivers run on tv when i was a kid and loved it it was great seeing a mini series that was set and filmed in a place so close to home living fairly close to i loved going to the historic port to see the paddle steamers the first one i ever had a ride on was the philadelphia in the movie i love how it takes its time to let the events unfold nothing feels rushed as most movies are today the acting was fantastic all the rivers run was perfectly cast and i just love the crew of the philadelphia mac is always amusing to watch with his trademark raw onion sandwich after a big night out easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorites mini series of all time along with the dynasty
<START> just saw 'the league of gentlemen at a special screening in manchester with mark gatiss and reece shearsmith of the league in attendance br br at the back was peter kay who has a brief cameo in the film affectionately heckling at the back during the q a session after the film br br the film was complicated in a good way and very very funny it follows geoff tipps hilary briss and herr as they try and save fictional vasey from the disinterest of their creators br br the league play a wide range of their characters and themselves or character based on themselves and are ably supported by the cream of british character and comedy actors such as bernard hill victoria wood and david warner br br warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in 'time br br the film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen's of vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtick br br steve herr has a great moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters br br this echoes something mark and reece said in the q a afterwards that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to them br br for a format that started as a radio character based sketch show these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction 'reality' comedy tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creations br br the fans of the show will love it it pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades the uninitiated may be a little lost but the joy of the log was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homage br br there are homages a plenty in this one including 'the shining' and 'la belle et la to name but two i spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in england that makes perfect sense when you're engaged with the movie br br what can i say i marvelled boggled emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at a successful british tv comedy to cinema translation br br if you've watched and enjoyed 'the league of gentlemen' in the past go see it you will enjoy br br if you haven't rent buy a dvd and then go see it br br well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous q a
<START> this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half few movies can actually give me chill bumps this one did few horror movie give me a sense of dread this one did it kept me guessing i cared about the story i cared about the characters the acting was decent unfortunately about half way through the movie the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go it becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self destruct it does what builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd a plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters the story concludes with disappointment while this movie seems complete there is one loose end that could setup for a sequel the movie isn't good enough for a sequel this movie is worth seeing in the theater just don't expect to be stunned this is best suited as a movie to rent it's probably not a movie you'd want to own
<START> i'm assuming the filmmakers heart was in the right place but frankly this movie is truly unconscionable i was offended by the tone and the total cop out ending you cannot take issues like this so lightly without knowing the final caveat of the movie we watch as a guy guns down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and are supposed to follow him for the next 2 hours as he tries to establish a new life you cannot have sympathy for a character who does this cannot not to mention we're given nothing until the last say 1 2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie as to why this guy is suffering so much no flashbacks no sudden reactions to noise or movement stuff that real vets are suffering from all we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and can't financially take care of her and his 3 kids there really didn't seem to be any research whatsoever into what current iraq vets are going through br br additionally the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score its a catastrophe it is truly harmful to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times joe morton it foreshadows everything you're supposed to feel and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely again this was a brutal thing this guy did and so seeing him get a new job meet a new blonde struggle behind the counter making toast is not appropriate and really the ending what a freakin cop out how dare you br br there are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers please don't bother with this one
<START> does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this i have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere probably because it was only on video and they never made the dvd or vhs or idk br br i saw this right off disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie if anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and willing to sell it to me for like 50 bucks or something please call 201 thank you
<START> valley girl is the definitive 1980's movie with catch phrases filtered throughout this wonderfully acted movie the characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual day in the life of any high school usa this flick is to the 1980's what the brady bunch tv series is to the 1970's if you don't like it well then gag me with a spoon
<START> although it was dark depressing and at times hard to watch you are alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog it truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships in addition the soundtrack was amazing the lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie br br jessica is the best actress i have ever watched her compelling and believable performance made the movie it made me wonder if she really is a prostitute who knows anyway the movie was very worth seeing love your sister yeah that's right
