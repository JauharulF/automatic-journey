<START> i loved this movie 10 years ago when i was about 16 years old my biggest mistake was to watch it again 10 years later it's not the worst i wanna be a pilot movies ever but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook them br br queen's one vision along with the rest of the soundtrack makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see br br
<START> anatomie isn't very unique in horror genre in fact it isn't even scary at all it reminds me of its american cousins horror slashers it's just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a german movie it's just too american with nothing to add to it br br actually anatomie is too predictable and boring its plot is not intact and consistent it's got stupid scenes to it which don't even fit into a horror movie genre amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear why do they need to have it all in just one movie they should have made a cheap german adult movie instead br br i can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring
<START> north and south is a miniseries from the golden age of television miniseries in the 1980s which was a time for long sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos it is for the most part excellent for what it is although i personally prefer the less soap opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history br br james read and patrick swayze deliver excellent performances especially read whose george hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story the series also contains top notch work from kirstie alley wendy hal holbrook lewis smith genie francis georg stanford brown and others the costumes filming sets and music are all first rate as well br br don't take it as a history lesson but take it for what it is a well made sweeping epic from a bygone era book 2 which followed a year later is also excellent but i would advise viewers to skip book 3 which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts books 1 and 2 are classics though even with their elements and they are well worth watching
<START> saw this at sundance one of the first years i attended the festival blew me away br br it went by much too fast and i've never been able to find it again i figured it would show up on a compilation somewhere but still no joy my memory's foggy on the details i just remember being surprised over and over again and on the edge of my seat br br anyone reading this have any leads online dvd beat up vhs copy i'd try to make it worth your while br br over the years i've probably seen over 200 short films used to live near aspen where they have an incredible shorts fest in april this definitely ranks among my favorites and i hope to see it again br br many thanks to anyone with leads on how to see it
<START> did the other reviewers watch the same movie i did this was poorly written poorly acted and just overall boring i made it well past the halfway point in the movie and then just gave up i can't possibly imagine an ending that would have made the rest of the movie worthwhile don't waste your time with this dog seriously
<START> crap i accidentally watched this film thinking that it was the swimming upstream that was released in 2003 i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it shame on whoever gave this junk an award i thoroughly loathed this film in fact i didn't see it through to the end after an hour i could no longer stand it i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such ba ad acting painful i rate it 1 star out of 10 an amateur could make a much much greater movie
<START> fun with dick and jane failed to entertain on so many levels there were loose ends with the writing for example it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of jim carrey's character dick harper but the writers never follow up that particular conflict basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny but carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor but honestly jim carrey wasn't very funny in this movie and tea leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either this is just another example of hollywood banking off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story
<START> the hysterical hardware wars is finally out on dvd has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a riotous little 20 minute short but a staple in low budget film production classes which is where a lot of the film's cult status is derived from and resides with the dvd not only do we get a chance to revisit the original parody cinnamon bun head ballistic toast et al that ernie f did in 1978 but there is a lot of additional material showcasing the wit antique sideshow is a dead on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the of ignorance and greed at the same time the director's commentary is also hysterical as is the creature feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk show circuit and actually is based on taking out on the talk show circuit albeit the public access circuit i'd love to see ernie michael and crew take on some other contemporary overblown and targets to parody like just about any film that hollywood churns out at 100 million a pop these days not so much the crafty films like spider man or men in black actually parodies themselves but any number of overblown overhyped overwrought and overpriced features br br
<START> i can't say i was surprised at this atrocity when i watched it a couple months or weeks ago can't remember i saw it as a two part episode of zoey 101 because that's how they showed it here in canada br br i was incredibly annoyed at the makeover a nerd thing it's just an example of how unaccepting superficial negative biased and stereotypical the people in the entertainment business is and frankly i'm extremely peeved it wasn't at all funny a nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offended br br secondly the people in zoey 101 don't have real problems logan has a big house he has a famous dad he has everything and zoey is rich too they never have to deal with the things that today's tweens and teens have to do deal with such as peer pressure and stereotype problems also the actors are horrific jamie lynn spears doesn't deserve to be in a television show as successful as zoey 101 what is wrong with the world she doesn't have any talent as an actor in fact she's worse than britney the chase and zoey thing was incredibly predictable i mean how could the show go on with zoey and chase dating what other problems could they possibly have except for the fact that chase doesn't get the girl he wants everything is perfect the absolute worse 48 minutes of my television watching life ever 0 10 and that's being generous
<START> my first ichikawa in many years and the first of his war films that i've seen this was gripping and brutal from the very get go in the very first scene nominal hero tamura is told that he can't continue on with his unit to which he has returned from the hospital he apparently has tb Â but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the quantity of war wounded they have but his old unit won't take him back either his co gives him a grenade and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself the honorable thing to do br br the phillipines 1945 and the situation really does seem hopeless for tamura and everyone else is an odyssey through hell or rather hells Â denuded forests dead rocky plains and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end through peace or death film is photographed in stunning b w scope which serves to highlight both the desolation felt by tamura and those he meets on his journey towards his doom and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the immensity of the mountains and the this small affair of humans will end soon the earth seems to be saying but i will survive and barely notice it br br tamura travels back towards the hospital but is not surprisingly rejected there and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive stay human and get out of danger he doesn't manage to do very well on any account slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts eventually he hooks up with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units and have resorted to in his weakened state facing other armed men finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes in br br film is as brutal uncompromising and intense as any war film i've seen there are moments of humor and tenderness but they are fleeting and don't stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the who practically begs tamura to eat his recurring black comic bit with tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for the better of a fallen the that humans will endure to the truth that this is any war all wars all mankind as long as we continue thus a masterpiece that i probably won't watch again for a long long time watched via the beautiful criterion collection dvd
<START> you'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land it's not so much of a horror show but a concoction of frightening and mental patients scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors notice the judge who's about to put on the ax from behind the doctor r r r not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness but when you get a chance remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady get out get out and never ever come back don't you wish you haven't looked in the basement
<START> remember back when this movie was made by robert downey senior a very good entertaining black awareness feature which was an underground hit in california los angeles and new york at the time a hippy loved classic where changes which occur in the business world are striking refreshing and interesting comedy non compliant not like basic society at the time of 1969 now watched is still very good but today's life in america totally diferent from 69 good for the baby boomers
<START> while i'm normally a big fan of john turturro's work as an actor and director is a great disappointment although the film has some charming moments overall it falls flat worst of all the film is confusing where is the movie set italy or an italian troupe in new york why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting if you want to see a well made inspiring historical film also about theater go see tim robbins' the cradle will rock this movie has many pluses including a fine performance by john turturro
<START> while i agree with the previous post that the cinematography is good i totally disagree with the rest this is nothing more than a porno movie disguised as an artsy film showing little boys naked is not art and amounts to child porn steer clear of this dud stupid is what this film is
<START> inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years werner herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker i've been acquainted with herzog for a few decades now and i've never not been impressed by both the man and his work last year i went to see rescue dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was yet couldn't help but imagine herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film but to live it no other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as has been forged into cinematic legend br br today i sat down to fata morgana a 1969 herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard without researching the actual locations i'm assuming it was shot somewhere in africa both coastal and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man infant civilization infant life on earth it is these origins the biblical notion of the garden of eden and the apocalypse that herzog is concerned with as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time br br watching fm i couldn't help but feel i was a passenger on a profound journey in the opening sequence the title is translated as mirage and herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip these images are perverted their 3 dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens piling layers of exhaust heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another the effect left me to conclude things are not as they seem br br fm is divided into 3 very distinct chapters 1 creation 2 paradise and 3 the golden age chapter one opens with countless languid images where bleak barren landscapes scroll by dead animals rot broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun the people this inhospitable landscape are ragged unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert the narration talks of a time before life a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens while the narration hearkens to a simpler purer era a portrait of a young boy holding a fox like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature br br in the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality we listen to a biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment as he holds the squirming monitor its tongue flicking at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing 140 degree heat the parallel is duly noted and herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm he also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways br br the last chapter takes us out of the blast furnace and into the more familiar herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior no one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than herzog possibly this is where he feels most at home much like errol morris herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll the subsequent flirtation herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut as morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime their facade gives way to something real the most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd polka like song that herzog recycles throughout this chapter the drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question what's with the goggles they definitely add some levity to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of herzog's br br the narration aside herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack leonard cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully melancholic songs so long marianne and suzanne perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride by the end of the journey herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon despite the overall bleakness of fm the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will persevere and possibly even flourish br br having finished writing this post i referenced fm to discover that herzog shot it in saharan cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup true to his legend herzog and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned while imprisoned herzog fell ill with a blood parasite it's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as fata morgana knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more br br http eattheblinds blogspot com
