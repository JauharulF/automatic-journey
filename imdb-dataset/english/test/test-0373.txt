<START> a criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin offs naked gun 1 2 3 this is fast paced in your face rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses br br leslie nielsen plays detective lieutenant sergeant frank an incompetent detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases with the capable assistant of his boss capt ed br br the story lines are spurious at best but it's deliberate as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters br br the jokes themselves come in many forms be it wordplay slapstick puns or background gags most of them hitting the spot though some fall a little flat it's inevitable with this every few seconds' approach that some will fail but the ratio is good br br the characters are a delight from the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode the laboratory scientist who appears to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe shine who is some form of oracle the writing is witty and sharp as a br br though not especially successful at the time it rapidly developed a cult following many blaming the shows' relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience chief amongst them none other than matt 'the simpsons' groening and he should know br br dated by todays standards if you can see through that aspect you're in for a treat
<START> sweeping drama with great sets costumes and performances Â though some folks are channeling rhett scarlett melanie and even lady macbeth patrick swayze and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location splendid villains Â you'll want them all to come to a very bad end lots of strong female characters in this one Â both good and bad secondary story lines also are well developed several cameos by major stars of past eras good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics br br curl up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one a lap rug and a cat would be optional
<START> this was a great film in every sense of the word it tackles the subject of in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm it criticises a great many indian customs that many find oppressive such as the arranging of marriages by others the importance of status and face religious hypocrisy sexism the valuation of women in terms of their baby making capacity the binding concepts of duty and so on at the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves the film is well acted and genuine completely believable from beginning to end unlike most bollywood flicks the main faults of the film as i saw it was first that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead end marriages with no passion and no rewards this may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters but most people stuck in the same situation will not turn homosexual it seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual when radha does her scene at the end of the movie with she makes it quite clear that without desire she was dead and the implication was that if he had desired so he could have fulfilled her quite completely and also when sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her such situations do not turn people into homosexuals they may seek comfort in others in the same position but film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning quite the opposite some people are bisexual it is true but most tend to be either hetero or homosexual in the case of the ladies in the film both had insensitive jerks for husbands if this had not been the case would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered the film ignores this the other fault is the naming of the characters the names sita and radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage imagine a film in america depicting a gay relationship between a man named jesus and another named paul by using names associated with various scriptures the film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion at any rate the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie it is indeed a very touching and powerful story the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre
<START> could this be one of the earliest colour films it's actually the second this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison this was one of many of his other films br br i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around which turns red with the film it's just beautiful br br you are watching history when you watch this you are watching what began to make movies of the day great this may not have a plot or anything very interesting but this is the second colour film ever br br i recommend this to everyone especially if you're teaching students about filming or something of the sort you have to show them what began color films
<START> this movie is not a comedy it is not even funny in the this movie is so bad it's funny department rather it is just plain bad other reviewers mention the bad lighting but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery br br meanwhile a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction the main characters are one dimensional and boring it is hard to feel sympathy for any of them it is also hard to see the four characters as close friends it seems like just a bunch of women thrown together pretending to be close br br i won't list all of the problems with this movie as it doesn't merit that much of anyone's attention nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it
<START> i bought this video on a throw out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award winning brit sex comedy i guess i should have read the finer print i rarely write a panning review but here goes br br these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors the theatre going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations br br i repeat is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on screen personae with this trashy flick can the reference to the austen classics 'pride and and 'sense and sensibility' be anything else how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars are we meant to simply take it as a lay down that all actors are gay and thus letting their on screen affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces too i'm sorry but i don't think so i say no to this one
<START> i'm not a massive disney fan but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them so we've built up quite a collection and this is one of my favourites we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since ok as others have pointed out not the most complex or inventive of plots but there's more to a film than that br br great characters phil harris stealing the show as thomas but edgar the butler not far behind the music is superb my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to everybody wants to be cat this says it all and thomas is just as enjoyable br br i'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats and yes it does take a few of its cues from 101 dalmations and maybe the lady and the tramp it's been a long time since i've seen that so i'm not going to compare them and while 101 dalmations is better in some ways for me the aristocats is far more enjoyable isn't that what these films are about br br apart from peter pan now that is a 10 10 film this is my favourite disney film my 7 year old son loves it his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it so you can't ask much more of a family film br br superb
<START> colonel chabert is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen i have seen in the movies it combines the realism of french cinema with excellent characterisation from depardieu's lost chabert to proud lawyer to fanny complex widow the movie has wonderful dimension as you might expect from a top cinematographer such as yves angelo the characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow in the beginning picks up pace and is a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish
<START> this appears to be two movies spliced into one in the first zasu pitts is a renegade in a small town she wants to help the romantic life of marjorie ok i'd never heard of her before either but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoction br br before we know it pitts is no longer miss polly she is i had to rewind to see if i'd fallen asleep somewhere i hadn't she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destination br br the movie has some cute moments the first part is better with roles for what seems to be every third rate character actress working in hollywood at the time br br and what of ms she sounds a little like betty hutton she sounds a little like marie wilson she's pretty certainly but she's no comedienne br br pitts often was used in very small roles here she has the largest role she's always fun though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn't go quite a long way as a comic when she was a tragic actress in von stroheim silents the wedding march and greed are the two i have seen she was brilliant
<START> i have read each and every one of baroness scarlet pimpernel books counting this one i have seen 3 pimpernel movies the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this it goes out of its way for violence and action occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book i don't expect movies to stick directly to plots i gave up being that idealistic long ago but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes but a barely decent script sticking with the 80's version
<START> unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level romance novel writing gets sluggish treatment although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott thomas were fine slick production holds interest even though the plot keeps covering the same ground and never builds any emotional momentum as a result the climax in the airport is a big 'so what '
<START> a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listening to round the horne or hancock's half hour or watching carry on films probably the most famous line in comedy infamy infamy they've all got it infamy still makes me laugh br br this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final quotation from the coroner's court read in four different voices by michael sheen he was brilliant in the role most of the other members of the carry on team were so so and their kenneth horne was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for him br br it left me feeling wow to quote kenneth williams to the cynic who says 'life is a joke' the only response can be 'yes well let's make it a good one '
<START> this is one of my favourite comedy films chris farley is hilarious as the accident prone moron and david spade is perfect playing the straight man to farley br br the dialogue between the two of them is brilliant the scene where the two of them are in the car singing along to superstar by the carpenters is a classic br br chris farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential he will be sadly missed br br
<START> when john carpenter's masterly version of the thing was released in summer 1982 it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office the audiences couldn't handle another 'bad' alien they wanted et their loss in the long run br br i would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen this is a movie that was way ahead of it's time now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers showing it's trail on things like se7en alien 3 and even the x files which unceremoniously ripped it off page by page and the structure which eschews character development in favour of incredible sfx is commonplace in today's blockbuster flicks br br carpenter shows the same skills he honed in halloween using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere the performances are all fine and the ending is terrific still unique today br br a paranoid masterpiece
<START> this was a sleeper for sure much better than i thought never realizing it was a horror flick and who was this gorgeous voiced hunk named vin diesel adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise film the monsters in this film were quite unusual not the same ol run of the mill gobble you up types the ending was great too for a change not all bad guys are bad i give it 2 thumbs up
