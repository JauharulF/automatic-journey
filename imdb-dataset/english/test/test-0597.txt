<START> william faulkner was one of the american writers to win the nobel prize in literature faulkner mostly wrote about life in the south particularly during the depression years many of his stories have been adapted to screen short stories like two soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in december 1941 after the attack on pearl harbor the older brother pete greer goes to memphis tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men some who would never come home his younger brother doesn't take his departure well he manages to get a bus ticket to memphis without any money to find his brother he surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to enlist also at 10 years old ron perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy this short film won an oscar for best short live action film which is well deserved if it was longer it could compete with the longer films everything else like costumes art direction and recreating the era of america in 1941 is perfect the film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most americans were surviving the great depression the actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances if hollywood would make more quality films i would probably go to the cinema more if broadway had more quality shows i would go to the theater more
<START> all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple exchanging nods over their good a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace quadruple takes or more when people look at things solitary banjo tuning and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a fawn about a big mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many big mouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there's talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stock footage close up shots of animals birds insects and spiders in the woods br br the movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands br br if it's true that the movie in the version available on the out of print videotape is cut perhaps if there's a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise it's simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors slasher fan
<START> i gave this a 10 because it's the best film of its kind a good old fashioned t a film in the shadow and spirit of animal house i saw this with a similar film called swap meet and both were good of their type a great way to spend a saturday afternoon let's be honest there are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an r rated movie from beginning to end they just seem to keep showing up on screen sunbathing scenes bedroom scenes and of course the climactic football game also a memorable kissing booth kiss me everybody seems to be having a good time in their roles several playboy playmates danny bonaduce several familiar tv and movie actors etc the only complaint i have to register is that lisa london's character is called by her last name o'hara and not a good 1970s name like olivia or even ora or ona or o i saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex wife pretty well endowed herself and she couldn't believe i was actually enjoying the movie she was probably jealous again this movie is a great way to spend a saturday afternoon just don't think too hard
<START> this film is really really full of sex hot sex i watched it of course on cinemax and i liked it of course those virtual fantasies are played out so much in great style and i kind of enjoyed the story line but one must know that when a soft porn film director sets out to make another soft porn film all he she wants to do is film good sex scenes and i got nice sex scenes full of skin yet another reason some people call soft porn cinemax films skinemax
<START> as a perfect day for ends with the suicide of a prodigy this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend matt who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy his brother tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question what am i going to do br br when he finds his brother dead his head broken like a dropped watermelon the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one the film focuses on tim he is a victim of bullying domestic abuse family alienation heartbreak issues of sexuality and friendship br br tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises but these are not the only injuries to his person as we slowly come to realize as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars everyone who loves him hurts him hirsch plays out the character quite well revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent br br two siblings sharing a doobie curled up on a red playground saucer tim asks penny what am i going to do with the rest of my life the scene is framed in a familiar recurring image of the film the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home filmed from a bird's eye view because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red playground saucer complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil from above after advising him to pass the joint penny tells him tim well the secret to the success of life is to find something you love and you have to do that for the rest of your life Â and you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie's central theme the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure why does one person have a talent he cannot stand like matt who hated the attention his swimming fame brought but no one notices tim's talent Â no one Â because no one bothers to ask him not even us the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome sad guy in our intimate understanding of tim as it progresses we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be this is the other side of the film the failure of those who should Â parents friends teachers Â whoever Â to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love not even his mother sandy played by sigourney weaver sees tim's gift despite her love for her son weaver does a deft job of a middle aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support when tim is found to be bullied at school she storms the boy's trailer threatening his life you can tease torture punch drive drunk with me i can forgive you hell i can understand it i'm a good christian you know i can forgive and forget but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live Â and i will outlive you all Â i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth after flicking a paper cup into the mother's face she looks around the trailer and looking at them both the kid and his stunned mother comments nice trailer and leaves as quickly as she came weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty and tim's father played by jeff daniels is blind to who his son is treating him like a stranger not telling his family that he took time off from the office spending his days in the city park listless a carved out soul and sleeping in matt's bed tucked in with his high school letter jacket jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son in an emotional scene tim confronts his father just when you think his dad is going to hit him he grabs for him to embrace him not letting him go he tells tim i am your father and you're are my son and i'm here okay but you've gotta talk to me i don't know how to do this by myself it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son you have to tell me what's going on inside of you you have to tell me who you are i want to know who you are it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment the visual movement from tim angry and alone to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis especially when you consider the mistreatment manipulation disregard violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses i recommend this film
<START> footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize psychological thriller is the most appropriate description i can think of the female protagonist alice discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end the unusual loneliness of the main character and the of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well the important part of the one and only everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror is an extra bonus
<START> witticisms colorful characters family relationships coping with hardships living with fun and humor this film has it all and more what a great 'every man and woman ' story with a top notch plot and script it offers just clean fun lots of laughter many smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family other reviewers describe the story some i'll just offer this comparison teaser Â it's part best of show grumpy old men millions and some other comedy and life flicks rolled into one br br this gem of a film most likely had limited release and is probably not very available to rent but it's now out on dvd and i highly recommend it for purchase if you like good old fashioned fun and entertaining films for the family you can't miss with manna from heaven this film is a sure fire cure for the blues or to chase the gloom away on nasty weather days or rough times
<START> i was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's seattle film fest screening and was blown away by how great it was this is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries i've ever seen and i've seen a lot this is a loving look back at the life and times music and relationships of one of music's true legends harry nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of gershwin cole porter and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards he was considered a peer by all four members of the beatles who all called him a 5th beatle and one the same wavelength as themselves br br harry refused to tour so many today don't remember him and those born after his heyday are unaware of who he was this is tragic everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent this film is a step in the right direction to finally give the man his due unfortunately the film has yet to have wide distribution or even a dvd so for the time being good luck in getting to see it br br if you are someone with the power to put together a dvd distribution deal please contact the film makers this film needs to be available hey vh 1 how about screening it on air then maybe putting it out on dvd harry nilsson deserves nothing less
<START> i had seen the cure when i was a kid and i loved it then now years later i got a hold of a copy almost by accident and watched it again being a kid you don't really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want that is usually a of your parents but when i watched it again now i felt sorry that i did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then and consequently almost forgot about it until today br br this really is a beautiful movie it tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard edged misfit kid who takes his cues from his horrible abusive mother and his neighbor a slightly younger boy who has aids br br right you say another one of those a tear jerker a bucket movie a morality tail yeah i know i hate those too only this one isn't it is one of the very few movies among those many i have seen that pulls off a very rare trick it conveys a truly sad story and yes a morality tale but without a single moment where it feels cheesy forced or in any other way it shows a real relationship between two real boys who interact as real kids do and through that interaction the good natured loving character of the older boy eric starts to shine through his tough guy persona as he takes on a kind of big brotherly care for dexter his hiv positive younger neighbor together they embark on an adventure to find a cure which to erik seems to be just around the corner so that all this silly aids thing will go away and they can be friends forever br br the production is top notch but of course what really carries this movie is the performances of the two leads brad and joseph especially who is simply stunning he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy but at the same time he manages to make dexter a truly energetic and determined character he shines at the scene where the boys confront pony his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth drives him to say what he says and only afterwards the horror is depicted on his face as he realizes that what he himself said is true his blood is poison also has his moments in particular the scenes with his mother he depicts perfectly how this macho street wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive storming mother and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance annabella sciorra also gives a memorable performance as dexter's mother who ultimately becomes in a sense a mother figure to erik as well br br i've first seen this film when i was at school back in america and loved it not at all a given concerning movies of this sort but the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real i could easily relate to them ironically enough the teacher who had shown us this movie a wonderful woman i'm still in touch with her got in trouble for it as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a playboy pathetic seriously will americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia i do not know there was a hardly distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools how sad kids need to see this movie it is more inspiring and educational than all the official after school specials put together br br oh and one more thing i know i'm rambling but nevertheless the score it's great i am a musician and as such i know dave from his records he is a well known jazz pianist and record producer up until this movie i really did not know that he did movie scores as well even though when i later checked i found out that i had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on really a wonderful job there br br all in all a solid ten i'd recommend this movie to anyone and i'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special effect hysteria they usually see
<START> if you like gary cooper this is one of his best roles his gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career hollister comes to dallas to take revenge against will and brian who burned his georgia farm and killed his family inept marshall gets in way attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between hollister and wild bill hickock the shootout is staged to get the law off hollister he takes the back east marshall under his wing to keep him alive in texas as they switch identity br br that was a great beginning and the picture holds up all the way through action may be a little slow by today's standards but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies
<START> this movie is painful that's probably the best way to describe it it's 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back well actually it's more like 86 minutes because there is no way anyone would want to sit through the credits in this stinking pile of dog feces immediately you can tell the movie is from the producer of mortal kombat due to it's thumping and annoying techno soundtrack this drains the few laughably enjoyable moments this movie can give you the rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters the freddie prinze jr school of acting acting abilities of all involved including the miscast christopher lambert and the non existant directing did i leave anything out of course i did let's not forget about the suicide inducing script with it's funny dialogue oh yes and let us also talk about how they shamed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic medieval translation the costumes and weapons were those giant pizza cutters i kept seeing are just plain stupid that's the best way i can describe them and the last culprit of the night is the always awful cgi when will filmmakers learn that cgi sucks when will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80's probably never but films like this and star wars episode 1 the phantom menace make us wish that they would bring them back in closing avoid this movie like the newest freddie prinze jr movie then again if you like freddie prinze jr movies then you deserve to sit through this horrid excuse for filmmaking
<START> first off this film has no story it's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set br br that said the film is kinda brilliant pfeiffer is amazing and i mean amazing as catwoman she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good bad tendencies walken is walken but even more nasty than usual devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin but he is good and memorable br br keaton is underrated as batman br br and the music and style are pure cinema thrill true the 3rd act doesn't work but the final 2 scenes are knockouts and it's clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness that's too bad because pfieffer and keaton had classic chemistry and had they acted in a third installment joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans
<START> i first saw this film about 15 years ago and i have been enchanted by it ever since it is such a feel good experience that i could happily watch it at any time of the year however to me it is the ultimate christmas movie br br the fact that it is in b w is irrelevant although i often wonder what it would be like in colour you can just get that warm glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold br br stanwyck and morgan are perfect together and greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character is a blustering joy to watch br br it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it br br i can't wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk i shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it
<START> if only he hadn't bowed to clichÃ© mr could have actually made a good film from this story it was just different enough to keep you interested so for the same amount of time energy and money as was spent on this stinker we might have had something good instead of eye rolling br br production wise it is as good as one could really expect from a hand held camcorder so he gets good marks there it's really the script that's at fault as the acting wasn't all that bad either considering what the actors had to work with br br i thought the days were long gone when we would see someone finding a radio transceiver they desperately wish to operate first turn every knob on the thing from end to end bash it on top 6 or 7 times and then expect it to work this story is ruined by a continuous string of stupid moves by all the characters except the bad guy it's as though we are thought to be too shallow to grasp all the plot devices so they are all spoon fed to us to make sure we get them br br i don't know about you but that doesn't work on me my attention ends up being occupied by the plot holes and over dramatizations not the story br br so since i found this to be not so bad in the technical sense i think mr should try again only with a proper script next time then he might give us something worth watching
