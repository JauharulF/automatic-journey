<START> seeing this movie in previews i thought it would be witty and in good spirits unfortunately it was a standard case of the funny bits were in the preview not to say it was all bad but the good bits were in the preview br br if you are looking for an adolescent movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie
<START> too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wish fulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie she's never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they're doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where it's called for as with julie andrews' bits or jonathan pryce's camp videos if you're not open minded you won't get it see mark bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brother's for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it
<START> idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots yes camp blood or if you're wanting an awful badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film camp bloody awful is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film br br awful acting check bad script check tacky effects check no originality whatsoever double check br br it doesn't even attempt to be different and is riddled with every predicted clichÃ© imaginable for example the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods so of course they end up dead br br one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels how and why only baffles the mind br br just stay away from this one
<START> there really is very little positive that can be said about this film walter pidgeon is a truly unconvincing hero and even moreso when he tries to go undercover as a villain who we're meant to believe drinks too much and knocks his wife about a bit margaret leighton as the wife undercover sergeant is a little more convincing but it's still difficult to believe that any hood worth their salt would not have seen through their charade in less than a minute the plot about a bullion heist is silly and the action drags rather than grips david tomlinson who plays algy in the same way that david tomlinson seems to play all his roles is the only glimmer of light in a wholly dull affair
<START> speck was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voice over which should be a testament to the mind numbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness for boredom don't bother this movie only clocks in at 72 minutes but it feels like an eternity
<START> i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish what was the movie about what is it a spoof fantasy comedy satire no answer there from gilliam's screenplay totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981 roger ebert has it right in his review the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue the movie also tries to confuse the would be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing
<START> i won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating plenty of other people have already done that suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that i've owned on dvd this is the only one that i got rid of it was so worthless that i couldn't see ever wanting to watch any of it again br br however i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2 9 as of 3 15 06 while skimming through the 4 pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than 3 stars looking at the voting history 78 of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb bottom 100 list it would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars none of who wrote a review of the movie are actual active users br br don't be fooled this movie isn't worth your time
<START> this movie has a big production feel that i was not expecting from an independent film the characters are each developed and dealt with in a way that not only helps to tell the story but left me with a satisfied viewing experience
<START> this film was really different from what i had imagined but exceeded my expectations nevertheless this film has the exactly right mixture of comedy drama political criticism and satire not necessarily in that order without being patronizing or it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist democratic high technology society it makes you laugh instantly and remain in thought afterwards for those of you who liked wag the dog and wished to have humane and politicians this film should definitely be the choice br br politicians are a lot like diapers they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons
<START> this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child it scared the living crap out of me so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through br br nowadays the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies br br i however still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness doug mcclure and peter cushing in the same movie great monsters made of substitute scary stuff a rubber monster is when you think about it is even scarier than a real monster br br the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is truly rousing stuff br br there's also plenty of prehistoric tit on show too nice
<START> i used to think that it came from hollywood was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror sci fi crime and drama movies of course i hadn't seen this beauty yet br br what's wrong with terror in the aisles four things br br 1 it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the '70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along and what bones are thrown to the true classics i e the black and white films like frankenstein dracula and the wolf man are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at all br br 2 the clips are most times so brief and out of their place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and for those unfamiliar with these films will make no sense at all indeed the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in jaws is shown much to the effect of a sight gag whereas in the original's context it had power br br 3 did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that it's only a movie or that most of the violence in the horror movies is sadly against women so is that an indictment against the movie makers for adding those scenes or the movie goers who into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again sorry that's a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie br br 4 and most importantly why is the movie so short it isn't like there wasn't enough of these kinds of movies to use if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film they could have had a that's entertainment style movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining heck even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing cushing was alive then mind you and better yet even vincent price would have been more than willing i'll bet what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience br br but no all we're left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie don't get me wrong it was good to see what clips they did show but if they could have just done more with the goods br br two stars another good idea left laying in the aisles
<START> from the acting to direction this new twist on the familiar ghost's been done wrong theme will keep you glued to your seat slow at times because it builds this 'what's gonna happen' tension medium well on gore but what there is nicely nasty spoiler the death of the and subsequent feast is a highlight for gore hounds br br the writers crafted an old story but added twists and re imagined you typical haunting cardone brings it to life er uh death br br lori scout taylor compton and the ever fabulous ben cross are real no signs of acting here everyone in the cast is committed and truly isn't that what any director strives for the actors believe so we believe br br along with the traditional ghost story surprises the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere from the mine hank's house and the home there's a creeping fear from the first frame to the last br br horror fans do yourself a favor and enjoy what amounts to be one of the true horror movies out there today br br i end with a big to boaz davidson story ben screenplay for without inventive writers hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality tv party
<START> humphrey bogart in his first starring role looks very young acts well but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career still he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor br br dorothy is the real star here playing a once rich woman who's torn between her real love for bogart he's broke too and the comfort and security of marrying an older man hale hamilton br br along for the ride are astrid allwyn as bogart's trampy sister bradley page as her would be producer barbara leonard as the jack kennedy as gilligan and halliwell as the faithful and wise butler br br both had been a star in silent films and bogart were trying to gain a in talkies in 1932 bogart was a slow rising actor from the broadway stage was slipping and would soon appear in skid row production like picture brides yet they are both very good here wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film
<START> this low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods the fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile bad c g i or an obvious studio setting fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific very realistic film the crocodile is real there is no c g i and the on location filming takes place in an actual australian swamp the actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances and they succeed you can place yourself in their predicament which is testament to how realistically black water translates as entertainment highly recommended merk
<START> i just wanted to say that i am watching national velvet on tv it is now feb 2006 and i was checking on dates details etc surprising to see it was made in 1944 and rooney was 24 years old whilst liz taylor only 12 what an accomplished english actress she is br br to put some americans contributors right there are no irish villages in england ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the english countryside the scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of england between brighton and county of no such scene exists now unfortunately like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches br br so please all you lovely americans do not confuse ireland with england ever we take great exception to it like confusing texas with coney island
