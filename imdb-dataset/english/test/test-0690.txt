<START> in 1984 edgar surprised film lovers all over the world with his epic opus a chronicle of germany eight years later he came up with a sequel the second chronicle of a youth which is even more astounding than its predecessor br br actually it's not really a sequel it's more of a as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first cycle br br the second begins in 1960 four years after hermann simon henry arnold was separated from his first love courtesy of his intolerant mother and elder brother the controversy had to do with him being a minor while she was about 25 still angered by those events the young man vows never to fall in love again a grandiose if creepy scene and decides to move to munich like the director himself did in approximately the same period hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy he stays in munich for ten years and the thirteen two hour episodes of 2 cover that time frame each of them focusing on a different person among hermann's fellow students people who like him are searching for a second home country be it music film or something else in which they can finally live peacefully br br like the first this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera in fact the second needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced whereas some chapters of 1 could be viewed as separate stories in particular the one concerning hermann's teenage years the style and content however is pure auteur cinema with the familiar black and white color transitions actually a tad more predictable this time around and ambiguous characters the latter element being underlined by the relationship between hermann and cello player clarissa salome they clearly love each other yet they keep embarking on affairs with other people delaying the inevitable until it's too late this time seems to be more pessimistic regarding his characters at one point hermann is so disillusioned he says the beatles are much better than us building entire episodes around dark controversial themes such as abortion and suicide the decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s the '68 revolution especially br br also seems to have made this mini series specifically for movie buffs given the numerous film references including a brilliant casablanca quote and clever in jokes one episode is set in venice whose film festival had an important part in the success and since 1992 film lovers have never ceased to thank him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever committed to celluloid
<START> massive spoilers ahead ok the movie in a nutshell so this girl goes out buys drugs gets pulled over by a cop the cops name is wolf the cop feels her butt then he eats her okay he beats her up and eats her then this woman is at home and this guy come with bulging genitals and he does her up then the woman goes into the other room and this black guy is there and she undresses then the movie turns into a porno he starts sucking on her breasts then she gives him head then wolf walks in with blood all over him and says honey i'm home then he realizes his wife is blowing some black guy and he kills her the black guy kills him cuts the girl out of wolfs stomach and the go home the end and they lived happily ever after that is the movie br br now after reading this do u really think there is anything to like about this movie the only thing i liked in the woman had a nice body but the performances sucked the story sucked the dialogue sucked the whole movie just sucked
<START> even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group i really enjoyed this movie it's a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star i know it was mine to be sure the first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy once you get over that you can really start to enjoy it i loved the relationship between jd and jane it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well i also liked the family set up for jane her sisters seemed lovely very well made film
<START> this in name only sequel to the classic roadhouse has a dea agent john schaech coming to the rescue of his uncle will patton when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang headed by that wooden indian of an actor jake busey the gang wants to take over the poor guy's bar for nefarious reasons patrick swayze is sorely missed here schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass kicking lawman the fights here are intermittent and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in roadhouse the finale is equally weak some good looking women keep things afloat for a bit there is a terrific fight between a daisy duke type who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons and a nasty looking babe of busey's who is handy with sharp implements there's also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of schaech's but unfortunately she never reappears in the film too bad she does a brief lap dance for schaech that had my full attention if nothing else roadhouse 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes darned close to what a real strip club looks like a rare circumstance in any movie the rest is snooze time
<START> contrary to most of the comments in this section i have to say this film just barely escapes the definition ' the only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalogue of clichÃ©s it is are those who like me live in the north east and know at first hand what the area is like i am totally sick of films that are supposed to be 'realistic' yet portray the working class of wherever as stupid criminal low lifes but then excuse them because of their social background and funny i smiled briefly twice and laughed once but that was at the incongruity of two boy actors with accents supposedly trying to hide their newcastle accents from football fans there was only one likable character in the whole film and that was the senile grandfather played quietly but very competently by roy the only non geordie in the cast br br as for the writing well i just wonder what university sociology department the author studied at he certainly had no ear for the local accent and i too have never heard the expression and not only am i a native i'm a linguist who's written articles on the local dialect br br don't waste your time and eyesight on this garbage it isn't funny it isn't realistic it isn't entertaining and it is fundamentally dishonest
<START> most of chaplin's most famous films are his full length features and i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts this is really a shame as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century br br if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of chaplin's better shorts because chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film this is great for several reasons first in chaplin's earliest films from 1914 1915 his character of the little tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether plus even when he is there he was often mean spirited and self centered something very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love second because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action a common problem br br so for a great look at chaplin's shorts at their finest give this film a chance it's sure to provide you some excellent laughs
<START> quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning pulp fiction however most of films especially of recent have been real real turkeys people still rate him and his stuff today and i really can't see why there are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies from this point on i shall not believe the hype that is a tarantino movie br br inglorious was too long and worse still you felt it the humor was well minimal and not that humorous the violence was nothing new minus the end scene the dialog was sometimes very very drawn out br br for some they'll love this movie and for others they'll hate it br br and i thought the subject matter of nazis was finally put to bed with the awesome 2004 german movie der untergang
<START> crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam levene and gloria grahame and is strongly directed by edward we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph sam levene is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and winds up dead br br i don't know about 1947 but seeing crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects i don't suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and anti semite language br br the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria grahame in a role she's a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife br br truly excellent and a must see
<START> this film rocks so hard br br the cameos the drug references the sharing the love the rocking when jack and kyle first met in tim robbins' actors' gang theater company years ago who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and hilariousness would ensue all that door to door rocking paid off br br although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film i would definitely recommend renting the original 6 hbo episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema they're on the tenacious d masterworks dvd which is available for rent at pretty much every video store there are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience
<START> i love this film dont know why it is called pot luck in england what a rubbish and entirely irrelevant name i spent 8 months in barcelona not as an erasmus student but living with other foreigners so it felt just the same it brings back so many great memories of the fun i had with all the friends i made from different countries and of the city itself i really want to see the followup 'les ' the russian dolls i'm guessing it wont be released here my brother saw it in france and said it def wasn't as good but had a lot of the same cast the brother of wendy gets married apparently anyone know anything about this film and whether it may be released
<START> maybe our standards for movies have increased since born on the fourth of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable
<START> margaret colin stars as the principal figure in this story as i watched it i remembered her bit part in adrian as diane lane's neighbor in a tony ny neighborhood br br this movie was surprisingly good and diane stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class crimes and which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods perish the thought it is real but not over dramatized the audience lives through her accident the pain it has caused denial and the ultimate resolution br br it is more than just a question of what is a good person as colin speaks to her husband is a person's character defined by one single act and should they be condemned forever because of their action the questions are pertinent it is also amusing to see several cinematic references to martha stewart i e the fussy bothersome mother colin is reputed by her sometime friends to be a perfect hostess with perfect genes gag and a scene wherein colin is confronted by police the friends also betray her later br br the denial and facades of american society are addressed oh murder doesn't occur here similar to the theme in season in purgatory by author dominick dunne about the true murder of martha in greenwich connecticut colin is aware of her crime but consciously finds herself perpetuating the facade until she finally breaks down rent or buy this film she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles
<START> the german regional broadcast station has shown both the general and on saturday i've seen the general and i thought it wasn't very bad but not very good too but yesterday i've seen and i switched it off after about an hour although kevin spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless the general told the story straight and ordered but just wanted to be cool there is a reference on the guy ritchie movies lock stock and two smoking barrels and snatch but doesn't have the coolness of these movies br br so in the end i would rate it 3 of 10
<START> given this film's incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue and a fine cast in place a series of robert altman style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly it collapses like a pack of cards a series of ludicrous coincidences and right on messages stack up until i'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about paul haggis has tackled the subject of race in la and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent this film is sure to have an impact on them that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie let's hope it is the latter because brokeback mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition
<START> why would this film be so good but only gross an estimated 95 000 000 and have no award nominations john travolta knows what he's doing he knows he's michael a cigar smoking womanizing magical arch angel that came down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of the national mirror and their dog sparky on the way to chicago it then turns into a road trip that's both horrible and great i don't even think the death scenes 3 to be exact make this a tearjerker the soundtrack is the best with heaven is my home up around the bend and chains of fools i have very great expectations about this and i say that it should have had a little more respect in the 90's read my comment bye
