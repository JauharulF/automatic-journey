<START> this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating if you're trying to impress some cute little i would highly recommend playing this masterpiece its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot br br also i was wondering where does a teal ninja hide are ninjas color coded like this is this normal if i were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas i would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword br br and i finished my black star ninja test the other day it was multiple choice it went pretty good i found there were a lot of questions on how to sneak around and look evil its all about the eyebrows and the attitude br br basically the movie could have been better if 1 there was no color coded ninjas or the color coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja 2 joe died in the first two minutes and patricia had to avenge him 3 miscellaneous monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4 patricia didn't talk and patricia was replaced with another character 6 the french guy was also a black star ninja 7 chris tucker whoopi and chris rock were added as comic relief 8 ninja strengths came from
<START> mary mary bloody mary is an ok time killer it has a uniformly attractive cast the action is rarely dull there are a lot of killings and the production values are not bad but in the end it plays like a standard tv episode from the 1970s with some nudity thrown in the film is the end product of an author trying to make a purely commercial film there's very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes except for the scene on the beach with the old man is almost devoid of any scares or suspense or dread the director has very little understanding of the horror genre br br it's watchable even though it doesn't leave a lasting impression
<START> on his recent maligned reality show mr shore conceded his filmic oeuvre is best enjoyed stoned no he must have said best watched while a healthy toke might see you through the end credits there is little pleasure to be found save some sporadic chuckling at the picture not with it titular absence is the least grievance other wholesome tiffani amber thiessen i dare you to rub out that saved by the bell patina of purity is miscast as a rural vamp she's too round of face for treachery mr shore himself occasionally displays the odd talent for mimicry i thought i recognized a jimmy stewart in there however it is never aptly used the trite fish out of water formula has yet to be rendered with less grace our hero crawl has precious little wit to account for expeditiously charming his agrarian antagonists ultimately i had to announce it's been the worst movie ever p s as another fish adam sandler fared better with mr deeds it may take a shore to appreciate a sandler
<START> i first played this around or when i was with my friends i thought the game was really great and loved it br br the game is simple on one player mode you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city my favorite was one with a tank on two player mode you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight through out the area you are in you will find ammo and weapons to help from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work br br again with player two mode there are lots of places to go and some to unlock i find this game really fun but also very suspenseful because you never really know where your opponent is and it's surprising to see them behind a door where you are going br br this game gets 1 2 stars or of very good go play it sometime
<START> i saw about a year ago and was mesmerized the only japanese horror film i had seen before this one was which i proudly own on dvd by the way superb the idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of lovecraft certainly it reminds one of shadow over of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities in this case giant snails and who can forget the washing machine sequence i hope we will soon see this one available on region 1 dvd i see that sundance has recently screened it on us tv hopefully they'll do it again very soon so that we can all see it highly recommended
<START> this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting even with ed mcmahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy jim brown kicks ass effectively gloria hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles and brock peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book it's still dull and badly constructed and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original james brown score
<START> i watched this movie recently mainly because i am a huge fan of jodie foster's i saw this movie was made right between her 2 oscar award winning performances so my expectations were fairly high unfortunately i thought the movie was terrible and i'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie the script is really weak the story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like mel gibson had played the role of the hit man the idea of jodie running off with dennis hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into i did think that jodie looked great throughout the movie which was probably the only reason i watched the entire thing maybe parading jodie around with as few clothes on as possible was the only reason the movie was made i saw a tv biography of jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in chronological order and this movie was the only one never mentioned after seeing it i can now see why
<START> this is one of my favourite movies ever i have seen it about a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to watch it again in fact i love it so much that i really wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation does anyone know the name of it if so please email me i watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and i was about age and for the longest time i bugged my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course i expected the same thing to happen to me it's just such an amazing setting and such a cute puppy love story this is a definite dvd collector's must
<START> yes this bizarre feature was written by john sayles shot in toronto it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants into this mix comes the myth of wild thing a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take maury chaykin and chopper the local crime lord robert davi stir in the local do gooders priest sean hewitt and clueless social worker kathleen quinlan and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences davi is the standout amongst the cast and cinematographer rene does a pretty good job otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves admirers slack jawed
<START> if good intentions were enough to produce a good film i would have rated the turgid ponderous obvious focus a bit higher than 4 macy does his best but as an earlier poster commented miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on newman so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him i agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in america during this time period then this movie might be an eye opener i grew up in the fifties and the good pastors of my church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach whose sign prominently indicated that no jews or blacks would be admitted it is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm and not just in the south as late as 1964 when i graduated from a somewhat racially integrated but sexually segregated public high school in baltimore my black classmates could not attend the traditional father and son banquet as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks sadly it was an establishment owned by a jewish family the subject matter of focus is important and we should never forget despite the lingering signs of racism in modern america how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were the greatest generation indeed so perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of steven spielberg and tom but in the end as in far from heaven the filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time
<START> butter battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race it is also as misguided allegory about the cold war and arms races in general yes it is a children's book but like so many of theodor seuss works it hits people over the head with its moral br br and that moral is what exactly sure it is laudable to encourage us to concentrate more on what unites us than what divides us it is even a good thing to encourage international cooperation but to equate the differences between the warsaw pact nations and the nato west to a difference in butter application is just plain wrong to point out the obvious many warsaw pact nations enjoyed intermittent periods of shortages of butter and bread they would have been happy to eat it butter sideways if it were available on a less literal level and whatever your political inclination soviet socialism versus western particularly anglo american democracy is not a mere question of preference and custom br br to make the point even clearer nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the soviets but in a hot war with the axis powers there is no doubt that germany was developing nuclear capability during the war should the us have refrained from nuclear weapons research putting their trust in their less than inevitable victory in the conventional war once the weapons were developed they were used against the enemy who attacked us at pearl harbor what does a nation do at this point when the genie is out of the bottle furthermore hindsight is 20 20 which is to say that there was no way of assuring another half crazed dictator wouldn't crop up with his eyes on developing nuclear weapons the second gulf war has shown the incredible difficulty in credible threats and them br br in any event the cartoon is little more than simplistic propaganda which does little to explore the nuances of the ethical questions behind nuclear armament and instead tries to fear of weapons technology into children
<START> they say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts br br that was not the case when i watched under the american title thirst now playing at select theaters near you seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details there will be blood in this film and you will try to look away br br for rest of review please visit http without blogspot com 2009 08 thirst aka html thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above
<START> is not only great it is also unique even taking into account other barker's movies which never lack originality an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book for the horror genre it has quite a few of subtle and references certainly a lot of fun to have a a bit to think about if one cares to and not to forget a nice music score well the special effects as usual get old faster than anything but that is probably the only drawback i've just seen it again after ten years and i still find it something to recommend
<START> the most positive points in this film were the credits text style and some moments in ice t's acting the story line two rival gangs having to fight it out with the sub plots of betrayal power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful very to wade through the decrepit scenery which added slight believability in places and questionable lighting constantly distracted from any interest identification with the characters the shine off of the actress's forehead nose was blinding not to mention other scenes with the same problem not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen a disappointment if you have seen ice t in other roles kudos to other actors actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction side kick and the other restaurant worker
<START> unbelievable i never saw something like that everything is bad really bad from photography lots of scenes without focus to the acting the young female is terrible and what can we say about those helicopters made in paint brush really amazing b i mean z film br br the plot are bad clichÃ© and bad wrote basics conveniences to the screenplay seems to work i can't even think a young student of cinema making this movie nothing justify it br br i recommend that you don't even think to see this movie sleep or play solitary are best choices br br xxx
