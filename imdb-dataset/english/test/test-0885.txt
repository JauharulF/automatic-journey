<START> safer indeed hitchcock is cinema's all time pervert however we all know his perversions are ours as well so we forgive him and we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride br br i saw hitch's 1953 i confess a week before this one and i put both in the same category as part of his trademarks these trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashame br br the pen is always than the sword and hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist and then holding firmly with his hands he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood most humans have otherwise comedy wouldn't be mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh wouldn't be so complex br br mixing all dark elements of high society with a wealthy psychopath bruno and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician guy the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by hitch inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares br br barely perfect
<START> now after watching the advent children twice the storyline isn't as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion if you haven't played or disliked it for whatever reason this movie is most likely not for you being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far br br without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered some were not ac is clearly for players fans and doesn't honestly try to be anything else there is little to none realism in it outside world which serves the purpose music is mostly reconstructed themes with a heavier touch team according to end credits and works well with the eye candy without exceptions i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations br br we all know you can't put a in 1 5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected there are two issues at hand in ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences and trust me when i say there's a lot of it action that is br br i'm changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i couldn't put together the first time that provided some answers as a warning it's going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics but try not to judge the children because of that if you don't let the story in it's no wonder it seems sloppy br br i'm not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome which might be an understatement especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole get ready for the ride of your life there are no breaks
<START> i think that this was one of the most trite films ever made no redeeming features at all even my 12 year old son said it was laughable may be a good candidate for the next generation of mystery science theatre
<START> honestly i don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show it embraces the elements of the original while expanding on them the storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit fast that is a good thing br br christopher eccleston is perfect in the role easily as good as tom baker br br rose is one of the best companions on par with sarah jane smith or br br i like the concept that the have been destroyed no more with the doctor acting as president emeritus and it adds something to the character to be the only one left br br the sfx are outstanding especially in comparison to the original br br take it from me and i was a huge dr who geek i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8 i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on tv right now possibly ever watch it and buy the dvd
<START> grande is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but if you're in need of it a movie for an x rated channel although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer the plot is simply an excuse for male to female and male to male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts there's likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa all that's missing is a female to female coupling which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot br br the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie but grande is to be blunt about it no more than pornography with artistic aspirations i'm not offended by the sex it's just repetitive and before long boring where's the hays office when you really need it
<START> as a camera operator i couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved the performances were excellent as was the story just when i thought this film was about to slow down it didn't heart pounding tension great pacing through editing and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction the camera was always in the right place love that
<START> i just saw this movie tonight coming into it i thought it would be good because i like natalie portman alot and susan sarandon is a great actor too but it was way better than i could have imagined you come out of the movie feeling great the acting was excellent which is something that can be hard to come by lately natalie portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at nyu think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor anyways back on subject the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and i definitely think that everyone should go see it i would give more details but i don't want to give away the movie
<START> i recently waisted 8 by going and see this movie in the cinema it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography br br it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadn't so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short movies br br another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people
<START> i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film trouble is the content could have been fitted in a 30 minute documentary br br there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the world championship there were other shots of kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located this just looked like filler br br also i didn't find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an ibm techie trying unsuccessfully to it what would we have seen of interest inside anyway a little grandmaster br br also the recent match against i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was it would have been nice to have been told was this a one off 'just for the money' was it part of the world championship cycle what was the final score the of the film was the play in game two could would ibm let kasparov see the machine that's where the focus should have been
<START> it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barker's writing even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot br br those who need a linear specific and plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the novella partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imagination br br another possible hang up is the ending of which i can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad it is in fact not very defined at all which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened but to me and to many others i'm sure just adds another dimension to the story the dimension of speculation and in addition the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far br br there is definitely moral here but of a rather different kind than the standard hollywood in your face at the end of the movie sort of display summing that moral up is simple even though it is not quite that simply displayed prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different br br i love this movie even though as many of the reviewers have noted the expressions of the actors with the exception of david cronenberg who does a wonderful appearance are rather tacky i'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth though seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay br br all in all this is a great movie provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie
<START> wow a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed br br i had no idea what this movie was when i started watching it late night i didn't find out it was a stone film until after the film when i went on imdb watching it i was mesmerized the cast especially eric bogosian is just superb one of the best scripts and camera work ever the movie drew me in and kept me entranced until the very end i did not dare blink for fear of missing something amazing how a small budget film can be so engrossing and well made while huge budget films that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring don't miss this film
<START> the thesis of father brown is that a good dose of roman catholicism will solve all of life's problems a little proselytizing i don't mind but this gets a bit ridiculous at times br br some fine actors have played father brown over the years kenneth more and barnard hughes are two good examples alec guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him but you didn't see any great demand for future father brown films br br i suppose if you are a committed roman catholic it all makes perfectly good sense it's far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see he's brought to justice br br but that's what were asked to accept here in fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners sidney james had during a robbery br br that's the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that james has in him so he can't break the confessional br br now on to bigger game master thief played by peter finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to father brown and was said to belong to st augustine back in the day but father brown is more interested in getting to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice so he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his mission br br i'm sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow father brown i'd hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested and he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about the man had not come to him as a seeking absolution and spiritual advice br br author g k chesterton a very noted catholic lay person in his day finds all this very reasonable carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests br br guinness borrows from his own reverend from kind hearts and coronets and from barry fitzgerald in going my way to create father brown granted though brown is a lot than the other two there's also a bit of colonel nicholson in this portrayal in the bridge on the river kwai guinness also was playing a character who's rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation nicholson was in br br father brown's an entertaining fellow when he's solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish we've enjoyed brother do it in a medieval setting and american audiences liked father dowling played by tom bosley a few years back br br this film should have stuck to being entertaining
<START> one of the best sitcoms to run on indian television along with bhai and great acting well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series the fun filled opening montage sung by none other than the inimitable kumar gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect i used to borrow it from my local video library years after doordarshan had stopped airing it i wish indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days anyone who's found of genuinely good comedy ought to go and get this series you'll might also enjoy a couple of pakistani sitcoms such as ups and downs and aur which are certainly comparable to india's best
<START> a remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best to remake a true classic especially one that is the definitive film of a director like alfred hitchcock is something else again and after watching this version of psycho ' directed by gus van sant two things come to mind immediately what's the point and what on earth were they thinking especially in light of the fact that van sant used the same screenplay by joseph stefano taken from the novel by robert bloch that hitchcock used the final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking first that a remake' should be just that a of the original rather than a using new players and second that shooting in color using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film although this was a noble effort by van sant ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which norma bates was afflicted the mind' of the film was divided half was hitchcock half van sant and the twain though met shall never be bound van sant even working from the original script would have been better off making his own film all the way through rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what hitchcock did with certain scenes the opening shot of the movie for instance and especially the scene arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema copying hitchcock from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain and using the same ' sound effects even as homage to hitchcock again only distracted from the story and if you factor in the performance of william h macy as private eye you have yet another split in the psyche of the film macy is a terrific actor one of the best character actors in the business and his performance here is excellent but as good as it is the attitude and delivery are pure david mamet with whom he has worked many times and seemingly out of context with what van sant is doing so the film winds up with a triple personality disorder hitchcock van sant and mamet i felt like i was watching house of good will psycho games ' br br as far as performances go macy's was as solid as they come and anne heche marion crane did a good job of creating an original character escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of janet leigh the weak links were viggo mortensen sam who made marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place and vince vaughn who to put it as delicately as possible was simply awful as norman bates his whole performance was that of an actor playing a role and not very convincingly at that affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with bursts of maniacal laughter made his norman more of a caricature than a character altogether unbelievable and pretentious it gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a true you would see on a television show it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober faced peter graves such was the mind set of norman bates on that fateful rainy night when marion crane stepped out of her car and into his life ' the supporting cast includes julianne moore lila robert forster dr simon philip baker hall sheriff al chambers anne haney mrs chambers chad everett tom cassidy rance howard mr lowery rita wilson caroline james remar patrolman and james legros charlie the car dealer if nothing else van sant's psycho' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success granted todays era of psycho babble american psycho' and hannibal lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like norman bates somewhat but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between norman his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying but van sant is unable to convey that sense of dread that throat clenching fear with this film if ever there was a movie made that should have been straight to video this is it better still had it never been born i rate this one 2 10
