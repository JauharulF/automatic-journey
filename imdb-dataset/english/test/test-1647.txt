<START> it's not surprising that the majority of higher rated votes were submitted by females aged 45 this is the timeframe in women's lives when they become the caretakers of aged and ill parents i lost my mother from complications of cancer in june and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by zellweger in this film yes it made me cry but the tears were real the characters were real and the plot development extremely accurate kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death and the promises of tomorrow
<START> as a history of custer this even close custer dies to help the indians i am sure the other members of the 7th weren't consulted in that decision but as a western this is fun flynn looks and acts the part of the dashing cavalier and the garry owen is always nice to hear
<START> this show makes me and many others hate their lives let's face it zoey is perfect she's bland pretty gets good grades everyone goes to her for advice she's popular she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms reasons why i gave this show a 3 1 the acting is horrible sometimes i just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses especially victoria justice on television 2 the characters are unbelievable and mismatched you have your typical popular girl a peppy shallow stupid stereotypical girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress and last a normal nerd person guy 3 the plot is boring and lame 4 i hate how spoiled these characters are can't they just be normal 5 everything ends up perfect for them and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink
<START> the sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted there are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here so i'll just concentrate on the acting miles o'keefe would have been better suited to play the spritely asian sidekick thong mainly because he would then have no dialogue lisa foster delivers her lines displaying one emotion dullness charles brings life to his part by pausing every five words and finally the flamboyant john saxon type guy no comment is needed br br see conan the barbarian if you need to but don't waste your time with this low budget loser

<START> all the boys seem to be sexually aroused by mandy lane all the girls seem to be jealous of mandy lane but nothing seems to become of it and this viewer wonders why mandy is beautiful and a magnet to every boy she meets but we never get to know mandy or any of the characters in the film mandy accepts an invitation from her student friends to go to a secluded ranch three boys and three girls drink and drug in the film the teenagers drink booze like its water and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip and there is absolutely no sex in the meantime the teenagers disappear one by one but the others are all drunk and high nobody including those watching the film cares or is at all concerned nobody including the audience seems to give a damn a fellow student is the instigator of the entire event there is a security guard garth dashingly and handsomely played by mount who guards and protects the ranch midway through the film the killer is revealed the tension is suddenly released like air let out of a balloon the events are completely predictable and the film just completely fizzles out mandy meets her match but we don't ever know why and at the end of the film there is still no sex does mandy hypnotize the boys or does she simply bore all of the boys and girls to their deaths this absolutely confused viewer can only conclude that mandy wishes to get rid of the female and male competition by killing off the manipulative girls and the nasty boys br br is mandy worth all of the attention the director jonathan levine seems to think so but this viewer does not the able cinematographer darren provides some stunning images but in fact his focus seems to be on garth who is quite the stud not all of the boys love mandy or do they if you want to be bored enough to find out how this film winds up my advice is to sleep midway through film until you see the temptress mandy and bulging crotch but don't wait for anything to happen yep you guessed it mandy remains a virgin and there's still no sex i rank this film a 3 out of 10 but not because of mandy why because all of the girls love garth and all voyeuristic eyes seem to be on garth in a compromising position but unfortunately girls and boys this film never seems to get beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy mandy goes to a secluded ranch and nothing sexual ever happens the audience is led to horror on a ranch and cannot help but wonder why
<START> this is absolutely the most stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera i cant believe i was enough to rent this piece of junk i have seen some bad movies in my time but this takes the cake ice cream and chips too omg i still cant get over how bad this thing was the acting was a joke the plot was non and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child i have never seen a movie take so long to go nowhere i mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes i guess this guy had some extra time on his hands like 3 hours and an extra 60 bucks in his wallet and decided one night hey lets go make the stupidest movie ever made and they did just that give me a break i'm heading back to the video store right now to get demand my money back anyone else who has watched this piece of trash should do the same
<START> as i'm listening to my parents watch this after i gave up 10 minutes into the film they have absolutely no idea what is going on when charles dickens stared into the camera i half expected him to turn into a demon yes he looked like one unfortunately that didn't happen br br this movie had various reasons i did not finish it one it was unbearably slow i mean seriously it was you can only understand 10 of what is said and the characters were poorly introduced br br if you have an english accent and you like a of talking no action terrible acting cheesy laughs and the same music sound effects played over and over and over then this is the movie for you br br 1 10 completely horrible br br avoid at all costs
<START> dryly irreverent but sadly unfunny satire of detective movies with stony faced michael caine playing a british author of trashy crime stories traveling to the to assist in writing the memoirs of a would be gangster soon he realizes he's being followed and his life is in danger caine narrates the proceedings with considerable sly wit and low keyed sarcasm but his actual performance is bereft of energy caine's shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and he connects with nobody on the screen other cast members particularly mickey rooney a silver haired lionel and lizabeth scott do very well in colorfully outrÃ© roles though al lettieri has an insulting part as an apparent cross dressing homosexual lettieri gets insulted without being able to defend himself an unenviable position writer director mike hodges has the germ of a good idea satirize the detective movies of the 1940s without compromising the hard boiled talk and milieu but he hasn't a very sharp sense of humor when a bogart lookalike asking a question about a falcon is the best joke what follows is anemic indeed from
<START> i swore i would never allow myself to devolve into to the bogus authority figures of the sixties who told me things were better in the good old days Â the current australian prime minister is a sordid example of just such a mind set br br but i switched over to a decade under the influence because i found watching the much heralded sneakers documentary on the other channel such a dispiriting experience i found the values expressed by the sneakers interviewees too ugly to accept as reasonable so materialistic so devoid of any sense of outrage at a society that can countenance killing someone to steal his very ugly shoes so lacking in any worthwhile purpose that they can report without distaste the exploitation an audience by haranguing them to hold those shoes above their heads to lock in a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of cobblers was just too much to continue watching br br a decade under the influence depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity corruption and in high and low places br br i have noted the change in film making that accompanied the exposure of america's disastrous foreign policy debacles in vietnam and so many less reported places in my www com au website a decade under the influence documents the precise moment at which that change took place br br before the seventies the armed forces were depicted in american films as an invincible fighting force comprised of decent human beings who into conquering heroes on the battlefield after the seventies they are generally portrayed as a rabble misled by a bunch of bureaucrat clowns in the pentagon before the seventies the fbi agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and protector after the seventies the fbi agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior's corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner br br before the seventies the archetypical american little guy the average joe the jimmy stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the american way after the seventies kevin costner that role but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed or accepting his lot and making out the best he can br br and now those old time religion mindsets have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed with a certain amount of justification as sanctimonious bigotry and self serving hypocrisy br br a decade under the influence tells it like it was a decade under the influence tells it like it is now it depicts the redemption of the american film industry from the hands of the artistically morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls it shows the storming of the hollywood bastille by the independent film makers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back into the cinemas the fact that their failures were numerous and at times disastrous merely underlines the greatness of their achievement an achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as clooney daman affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent
<START> icky flix is an excellent starting point for anybody with even a vague interest in the residents most of their classic videos are present although earth vs flying saucers and don't be cruel are curiously missing and the concentrates of their various cd rom projects offer tantalizing glimpses into how the ones have been spending their time since they realized mtv was no longer putting them in heavy rotation or indeed showing videos period br br all of the videos on this compilation feature striking imagery and idiosyncratic music with a choice of the original tracks and newly recorded ones and two of them the third reich 'n' roll and one minute movies are in the museum of modern art's permanent collection check out this dvd and find out why
<START> i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now an 8 3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves i don't mean to pull one of those i just signed up for an account so i can post on this movie bits but i just did the only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed br br now i realize many film people love this movie nevertheless it is crap the thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the in the movie if you do have sexual relations with your sister you should probably be an outcast from society just my personal feelings i guess yet i sat through 2 hours of this expletive expecting some really deep reasoning behind soo's imprisonment br br i tend to like a lot of foreign movies but this is my first encounter with a korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book oh i feel better already after a little venting
<START> about the discussion on the south the rednecks and the hillbillies well i am from the south argentina near the south pole to be exact is this southern enough seriously some stories are universal we have never been to greece nor lived the classic period of homer but he speaks to us today so does shakespeare and dante and stories from far unknown places also reach us when told with sensibility intelligence humor just like o brother besides we all the rest of the world have our own hillbillies too and our own depression era ever heard of argentina during year 2001 our politicians and racism our gentle souls just like delmar and tommy i simply loved this movie folks despite the subtitles despite being on the other side of the world and please forgive my errors in english i tried my best br br ps i believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase when delmar asks george nelson what does he do for a living while handling him the machine gun
<START> this movie is bad as we all knew it would be most times i usually love the bad 80s early 90s trash can comedy haha no pun intended i list ski school career opportunities hot shots summer school and many more made around this time this even has the classic yet forgotten comedy of dean cameron aka ski school section 8 instructor and party maniac for summer school but this movie is just to slow it takes almost 30 min to get going and we have to sit through pointless dialog between to half wits the sheen boys e c and yes i can hear the bloggers dieing to trash me with obviously you don't watch 2 and 1 2 men well charlie was not at the level he is now during this flick not that he's anything worth watching now charlie only shines when his co stars support him and emilio isn't anymore than an overused wonder bra offering little support actually this movie was written by emilio and it shows it has no real ending come on emilio even the ski school 2 writers barfed out an ending no idea how any issue brought is solved no hot babes no swearing to lighten the bad plot characters acting i'm now tired of this tirade just save your time and watch the movies i listed above you'll enjoy them much more
<START> i have no idea how accurate the portrayal of flynn appears in this film but even as a work of fiction it is one of the worst films i have ever seen br br the script is all over the place and leaves you wondering how he got from one scene to the next you are just not given the minimum information needed to keep some continuity and understand his present situation and it is difficult to understand flynn's and other characters' motives behind some of their behaviour br br add to that a series of silly and implausible situations and you have film that comes across as one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you are asleep but when you wake up and you try to remember it it is just strange disjointed and totally unrealistic br br there are many long boring musical sections of the film that to me are either bad direction or a bad director trying and failing to be artistic br br none of the characters are even likable and the flynn character comes across as a self serving liar thug thief robber murderer bear fist fighter gigolo and impostor who will do anything and step on anyone to further his own dreams and somehow despite all that great opportunities just seem to miraculously fall into his lap br br this film is not entertaining nor satisfying in any way and by all accounts not even historically accurate so why even watch it to rub salt into the wound the dvd had one of the worst transfers i have ever seen it wasn't even in wide screen or dolby 5 1 it had terrible wobble and many many artifacts from what looked like a film reel that had been gathering dust and scratches somewhere
