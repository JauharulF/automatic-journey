<START> ok i'll admit it i'm a huge fan of b movies back when michelle bauer linnea quigley and brinke stevens ruled the roost and back then even the bad movies were still good unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad even a small cameo by brinke stevens reprising her role as linda from slumber party massacre 21 years earlier doesn't help this one out a group of cheerleaders take refuge in a fancy cabin after their van breaks down a psycho stalks them one by one catching them in various states of undress bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad skip this turkey and go rent slumber party massacre 1 2
<START> the odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesn't had the main male character been a little more interesting the film would have been as well a trio of young americans visit paris run into a beautiful werewolf and the problems confound from there br br numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take
<START> i'm a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most far fetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the captain out of the engine room that would never happen swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances second the command center supposedly in it looked more like a nasa command center we don't have any gear that hi tech third the captain of the would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist controller a radio otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days
<START> mild spoilers br br this movie was filthy and stupid it could have done well without the constant humping and nude sex it was also very profane i think that they had a good story developing but they messed up the whole thing by overdoing it
<START> watching this movie brings several words to mind sophomoric ridiculous improbable self indulgent and finally and fatally boring badly directed badly photographed and badly acted the film is a confusing mess with plot lines if one can call them that veering in all directions someone may have used a five year old's finger painting as a template as punishment for this childish crime of a movie this cast of stars should be spanked soundly and sent to their respective beds without dinner all in all it seems like george needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation and we're the suckers paying for it bad george bad
<START> in 1989 aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out in 1993 they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers and in 1995 they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave in 2005 they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and in the curse of the were rabbit in this full feature film wallace and gromit work in a pest control business there's going to be a giant vegetable competition but rabbits keep eating the neighbors wallace and gromit takes care with that problem but wallace had an idea he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine after doing that something suddenly eats all of the in the neighborhood and it's big it's up to wallace and gromit to save the day as a fan of these two characters i was impressed it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice overs they put a no name cast to the job and boy they did a fantastic job wallace and gromit has not changed wallace is still the cheese loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog also the script was not too shabby like other family movies were there is a twist of who the were rabbit really is the direction from nick park the director of the 3 previous chapters does a really good job with the storyline instead of adding the hollywood formula in it he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it well done nick the rabbits are also funny and adorable but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying but they'll never top wallace and gromit the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful i've never seen a clay animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run overall fans of the two knuckleheads including the teens will love this fantastic film it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year hooray wallace and gromit 10 10
<START> it kicks you in the stomach there are other films with more convincing characters a more realistic story and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations but then again most of these are not directed by peter maybe the one true genius artist of british film to emerge out of the 1960s has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer aesthetic world the world of political ongoings social problems and governmental solutions thus his work is probably less filmic than say political which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality then again why shouldn't art allow itself to become engaged dares and succeeds you won't feel well with this one you won't feel happy actually you won't really like the film it is uncompromising honest direct unashamed a smash in your face in short you can't help getting angry you can't resist to let the things you see touch you that is what makes watkins' films so rewarding
<START> norm an ally i don't mind remakes there are some pretty good ones out there but this one is a stinker considering it was practically scene for scene it had a good story and great actors van sant copied al's direction virtually flawlessly and it added color i'm not one of those who think it has to be b w to be classic it should have been at least a mediocre movie but it was pee pee i don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly if you must watch it as a curiosity but i would suggest that you not bother
<START> the memory keeper's daughter in the form of a novel by kim edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation so what happened when the novel became a made for television movie perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay oops teleplay by john that consistently along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the musical score by daniel for whatever of these or all of these reasons this novel to film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with down syndrome and for that it is worthy of attention br br dr david henry dermot mulroney a successful orthopedic doctor is married to the beautiful norah gretchen mol and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy on a stormy winter night in kentucky norah goes into labor and the henry's rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife the doctor is caught in a snowstorm with the assistance of his old friend nurse caroline gill emily watson after the delivery of a perfect boy child paul norah continues to be in labor and surprisingly delivers an unexpected twin girl david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl phoebe is a this is before the use of the term down syndrome and david having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect decides to send phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged caroline is to make the delivery and norah is told the second twin died at birth br br caroline follows instructions sees the conditions of the 'home' where phoebe is to be deposited shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child aided by a friendly trucker caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers phoebe finding a new life in her pittsburgh norah insists on a formal funeral for phoebe a fact that deeply disturbs david's psyche and the henry's life goes on with only the one child paul leaving submerged pains about the lack of presence norah gifts david with a camera lives are like a camera that's where they live in a room captured by a moment' and david becomes obsessed with photography norah grieves drinks and loses david's attention while david traces existence with caroline sending money and letters to pittsburgh paul tyler to jamie grows up discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician and off to he goes meanwhile phoebe krystal hope has matured into a very highly adapted young girl and the manner in which the broken marriage of the happens and the healing atmosphere of and paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film br br the cast of well known actors tries hard but only emily watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script jamie gives evidence of a young actor with much promise dermot mulroney and gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver the film is a mess but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one grady harp
<START> i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago i didn't know what to expect precisely and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film it was beginning very slowly in silence and almost banality which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read br br but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies i've ever seen at the same time human ruthless and psychologically so convincing br br seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully with such an intensity on their faces liv ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and sydow is excellent too br br there is always psychological violence in bergman movies and this one may be the most physically violent of them all the strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them br br finally this sober violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth an excellent bergman br br
<START> so many people loved this movie yet there are a few of us imdb reviewers who found mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse boring i fall into the latter of these two camps and i will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly br br firstly to set the record straight i like neil gaiman's books i sometimes find his knowing sarcastic humour a little geeky and i actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone but even with his occasional lapses into crap gags i find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special br br interestingly one of gaiman's strongest works is coraline a gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness his latest novel boys overdoes the and tends to read at times like terry does the sisters of mercy not the nuns but the band mirrormask inhabits similar territory to coraline and when i saw the stunning visuals in the trailer i got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen br br in praise of the film some sequences do look stunning however the visual effects are occasionally ruined by cgi animation that looks like a media studies student project backgrounds and scenery are often incredible but some of the character animation looks clumsy amateur and cheap in an early dream sequence the spider is animated beautifully but the book eating cat beast looks poorly rendered and very compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as 'the corpse bride' mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed however in defence the budget was tiny for such a grand vision and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven br br what cannot be forgiven is the stilted stagy cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue the actors struggle desperately with the dialogue and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it conversation is rendered completely unnatural the jokes fall flat time and time again and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer's only method of plot exposition combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen which always adds an element of 'phantom this renders the film almost unwatchable in such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed and in the main they fail terribly the girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage school dialogue and occasionally shows real promise but it is never enough the god awful cod 'oirish' of the valentine character with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material it appears to be valentine's job to explain the plot to younger viewers and to add a bit of light relief personally i wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter br br what else is wrong with this film answer rob what's annoying for us brits anyway is we know rob can act we've seen him hold the screen for half an hour on his own doing those monologues and in the first 'real world' bit of the film he is fine however stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am ham i've seen in years a real shame br br what else is wrong answer the wanky slap sub courtney pine and too high in the mix soundtrack that never shuts up god the music is incessant loud distracting irrelevant and if that isn't enough has wanky slap bass wanking all over it it makes the dialogue very hard to hear but that could be a blessing in disguise br br what else is wrong with it answer the whistling mime artist in modern society there should be no place for mime apart from certain secret places in france every moment the camera lingers on the gurning whistling moss juggling yogurt weaving idiot i understand why the edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and when festival time comes round again br br my final criticism is that the film is pretty dull surrealism often is dull Â it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike zen accepting state or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises a story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping br br finally apologies to all those who found depth meaning and wonder in this film you have managed to suspend your disbelief you have seen past the creaky cgi ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted and understood the maker's grand imaginative vision i wanted to but i couldn't see past the real world failings that dragged it down br br i hope neil gaiman gets it right next time if he gets or even wants the opportunity
<START> first off this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise you don't know what to feel so much so that you don't feel bad for character when his son gets murdered which was actually mostly due to bad editing the script was too bland none of the situations matter as you watch them the soundtrack or lack there of if there was it wasn't good enough to even remember does not help it one bit only good surprise to this movie was andy performance it was on par if not better than caine's the story would have probably gone better off if would have killed him because quite frankly you don't feel any kind of redemption in the climax just a feeling of lack of feeling if ya feel me basically this movie massively lacks draw leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing
<START> i have not seen and heard the original version br br i am no russian but i am learning right now br br i also have no preferences for russia the us etc br br but what i have to mention is br br in the german synchronisation in the whole film all russians speak with russian accent americans talk without accent i have never heard such a stupidity besides this is boring br br i hope the original is better br br the rest is a simple thriller not really good ideas like a cheap version of a james bond film
<START> let's see what are the advantages to watching piranha piranha well if you've never seen anything to do with venezuela there's a lot of travelogue footage of both caracas and the countryside and jungle side and of the various native peoples at work and play as well as plenty of indigenous wildlife if you like william smith he plays a bit of a git as he has always been wont to do br br and that's about it if it wasn't for william smith this could probably pass as a fund raising film for save the children or some other organization that benefits the third world the only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits no mutant killer fish like in roger corman's named piranha you'd figure with twice the fish in the title there would be twice as many monster fish preying on the characters but alas this is not the case br br the story starts with a photojournalist and her brother coming to venezuela to do a story on one of the last untouched places on the planet but their motivation quickly changes to one of wanting to find diamonds which are apparently fairly plentiful there br br there's not a lot of real action or danger in this movie what could've been an exciting motorcycle race is dulled by the mass of landscape and animal footage that is inserted in it to draw out the films running time there's not a whole lot more action until the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the br br in my view the only ways that a movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid piranha piranha certainly qualifies for that former badge and is pretty damn close to the second the only reason i won't rate it a 1 is that the added footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie
<START> to put in simple words or rather a word would be best suited by pathetic the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot but but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall br br it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull directed by a debutant and acted by high school students movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not so great indian movie her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery br br overall i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch then try watching it at home when some tv channel airs it believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors br br and better carry a aspirin u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel p s i have no clue if the other reviewers even watched the movie i did and wasted my 10 on the ticket
