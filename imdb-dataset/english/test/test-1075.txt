<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i didn't go in with high expectations but as soon as it started i thought it might be o k it wasn't jim carrey seemed to try but he spoke all his lines as though he were some diabolic cartoon character the other actors all seem to try their best but are kind of wooden the plot has a good basis but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid i was laughing during the whole second half of the movie and after five minutes of that i got tired of that most plot 'twists' you could see from several miles off it's just not worth watching i really wish i hadn't wasted my time with it
<START> the female cast of this movie is terrific you've got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesn't get too many speaking lines that's a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina how the goofy male lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesn't really get going until the last 15 minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything 1 2
<START> jean pierre melville's le rouge follows the lives of two criminals vogel gian maria a murderer who gives the cops the slip while he's being transferred from one city to another by train and corey delon a thief just released from jail fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist in the background there is andrÃ© the detective vogel escapes from implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods along the movie the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters the best of which is jansen yves montand a disgraced ex cop and an excellent marksman br br melville has such a unique style one doesn't need to watch many of his movies to catch on le samourai un flic and le rouge are clearly made of the same cloth the symmetrical angles the long shots the silences the coats and hats and cigars the quotes at the beginning the amazing heists the fatalism the unglamorous and inglorious criminal life everything that's great in melville is present here in top form br br and his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time the illogical perplexing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling which hurt my enjoyment of his other movies are almost invisible here since le rouge preceded un flic that doesn't mean he got better with time perhaps i'm just getting more used to it and reaching a mindset where it doesn't bother me anymore br br melville made unique crime movies as old as they may be they show more ingenuity realism and grace than the modern techno thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and james bond esquire gadgets to pull off impossible crimes melville's criminals aren't cool they're lonely socially awkward and probably aware they're not good for much more than planning heists they're society's unwanted living in the night always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually there's nothing romantic about them br br amazingly for a movie of this type the cops aren't complete idiots either is smart crafty patient and even compassionate he's not an unlikeable villain or a clichÃ© he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right he knows when to use force and when to use brains many movies could learn from him br br it's this down to earth unromantic style that makes melville's movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of cinema's great crime masters
<START> this was probably intended as an arty crime thriller but it fails on both counts there are few thrills and not enough substance the plodding pacing makes it hard to sit through and the occasional action scenes are too sloppily edited and confusingly staged to offer much compensation at least the level of acting is high
<START> this trio of 30 minute short films on gay related themes are all quite respectably executed each coming of age story is played out with pleasant charm and naturalness this film deserves to be widely distributed and easily however it isn't i had to order my video copy none of the local video stores or even the libraries had it in stock
<START> i sat through all 2 hours i do not know what was worse the awful plot the lame characters or the hawaiian hottie that eddie's 11 kid and 80 year old grandpa made sexual advances toward the money spent on this was just flushed down the throne simmons should be ashamed the original idea for this movie was a swiss family griswold and it somehow turned into this mess the only bright spot is that it's ratings were so bad we will never see this on tv again avoid at all costs rent ernest saves xmas or something else
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen this in my opinion is rob lowe at his best i'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating i guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental
<START> by the mid 1990s the career of animator director don bluth had seemed to drop to its all time low before bluth had made a series of popular animated films many which remain beloved today such as the land before time 1988 the secret of nimh 1982 and an american tail 1986 but beginning with in 1994 his films seemed to decrease more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is 1995's box office bomb the pebble and the penguin a film that didn't attract audience members beyond parents and children under the age of seven frankly the latter are the only audience members i can comprehend taking enjoyment out of this rather bland animated feature br br the story is absurd the film stars a poorly drawn stammering and chubby penguin named voiced by martin short who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head voice by annie golden sort of like in real life penguins present their bride to bes with a pebble as a substitute for a ring but when is swept away by the current he teams up with a lone james belushi with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to antarctica before it's too late the reasons why they could be too late is one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there br br it becomes very clear very early on why this animated children's musical does not and will not work for anybody older than say six or seven years of age it just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature number one the film looks bad on account of a very poor drawing style the animation in this film is very cartoony even as far as animated films go it's dark gloomy there is no vibrancy in the colors and on top of that the design of the film and the elements in it are universally droll and laughable take for instance the penguins who star in the film with only a few background exceptions every single penguin looks absolutely nothing at all like a bird for example looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks a stubby beak big eyes and that preposterous hat that he wears wherever he goes combined with his hand like flippers he looks like chris farley in a penguin suit result he's an ugly poorly drawn cartoon character but the most absurd looking and absurdly designed character is the evil penguin drake who frankly looks nothing at all like a penguin he's a muscle man wearing a penguin mask he's got a chest broader than that of arnold schwarzenegger and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killer whales that serve as the film's predators basically he's a two dimensional recycled villain he lives in a cave shaped like a skull he wears a cape laughs a lot and gets mad when people laugh with him result who cares and what's also bad and maybe worse is that this is an animated musical and there's not a single noteworthy or memorable song to found anywhere within its running time the opening hymn was memorable but harmless but after that the songs became duller and duller and there was one in particular that had me grimacing all the way through it's the moment that viewers press the fast forward button for whenever it comes up br br i felt the pebble and the penguin was lame all around save for the very few moments when and the penguin are placed in peril at the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales who were thankfully given no dialogue and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters but in a way for this reason i cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children this is the reason the film displays killer whales are the natural predator of the penguins my concern is that children familiar with free willy 1993 may be offended or by seeing their favorite denizen of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty the leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a and how he appeared to smile while growling but the point really is these moments with the there are only a the only interesting moments and they're not enormously interesting mind you br br bottom line i cannot recommend this to anybody below the age of seven my advice if you have children around that page rent it for them they might enjoy it
<START> this movie was in my opinion very ignorant there is only foolishness as the motivation of the the police procedure was unrealistic the generated no sympathy from me the story must have been written as the movie was filmed unless you like police bashing stories don t waste your time br br
<START> as i type these comments i'm watching a dvd of this movie that i just got from a mail order dealer and i'm finding that it holds up extremely well with strong characterizations believable situations and well staged action scenes br br it's been a good 45 years maybe 50 since i saw hell below but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was sterling death scene which several other commenters have mentioned here i haven't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing but i can vouch for what other comments have said once you see sterling death scene in this movie you will absolutely never ever forget it judging from how strong the film so far is holding up i fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history the movie's worth seeing for that moment alone but even without it it would be a first rate early submarine drama
<START> spoilers a hot and sexy linda blair as the witch amelia reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival witch across town erica julie strain amelia getting her husband hal edward albert to get a promotion at his job at the giger greengrass law firm over the more deserving larry barnes larry poindexter who happens to be married to erica has her cast a spell on hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself br br larry finding out about attempt on his best friend larry's life has a violent fight with her causing erica to fall from the balcony to her death it's when larry goes back to his ex wife carol rochelle that things begin to really heat up emotional and sexually the wicked amelia tries to have the dead spirit of erica take over carol's body and end up murdering larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband hal's injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair br br not much of a story but lot's of cheese and soft core action with poor larry getting manipulated by amelia through the resurrection of erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn't a threat to her amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener stan michael parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break in then his mind by being accused by the police as being the murderer and finally is life by getting blasted by herself as he's made to runs into the reynolds' house under her control as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled hal br br larry parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of sorceress and ended up being in the cast playing his part as stan without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god awful bad the movie really is stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn't have to suffer like those of us watching through the entire brainless and mind numbing movie br br it becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of sorceress that all this on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie the ending is about the best thing besides miss blair and the rest of the very well endowed woman cast that one can say about the film
<START> for several reasons this movie is simply awful other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors well i have a layman's knowledge of roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate and shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some let's say historical license but this movie goes well beyond mere rounding br br there's worse to tell a story from a distant period the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period they will quickly be lost in addition the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in italian and english with various actors being dubbed later at times the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together in fact this is not far wrong the actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient rome br br the only reason i give this boring mess any stars is because i always find peter o'toole entertaining but that is no reason to rent it if you are curious about roman history there are much better movies available
<START> although not the most technically advanced film i have seen this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them and feel something when susie q has to go but feel good again when she returns as maggie br br lots of stock dialogue and a contrived plot line but most of all lots of fun
<START> this is a classic war movie one of the best a stark image fest of flashing lights harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans a star studded spectacle of immense power br br martin sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great marlon brando also along for the ride are robert duvall as an over the top di with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it dennis hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as laurence fishburne r lee ermey sam bottoms albert hall and keep an eye out for harrison ford too br br behind the lens is francis ford delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed godfather films he highlights war in it's most basic form which for the most part is something you can't see you can only feel it as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable the feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers honestly no films has ever made me feel like that br br criticism is hard to find the biggest qualm from some is that brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this is unjustified it was money well earned a role that physically restricted him being at the time an unwell man and a role that he really made his own i can't picture anyone better for the role and if you get the apocalypse now redux version there's some extra bits of the great man and i think the redux does make the film miles better br br final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage if not then still you won't be disappointed this film is up there with the best and deserves some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made
<START> conclusion very but very very boring yet i watched till the end hoping for some upside down effect but the end was worse because it was nothing the old black white game didn't helped at all it usually helps psychological movies but this was not the case the script the plot etc were linear had no substance nothing in going when you deal with psychological you deal with analysis therefore with details that unity diversity formula there was no essence no detail just a story there are many stories to tell but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie makers well this is not the one
