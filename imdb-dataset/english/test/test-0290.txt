<START> i usually give horror films around 6 10 but this one caught my eye house of wax was by far the best horror film i have seen even better than the amityville horror br br paris hilton was quite good in this and i must say has a good future ahead her death scene was probably the coolest i'll just say how she dies br br she gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close ups on and everything gory eh brian van holt was very good as both the killers bo and vincent vincent had the long hair usually he plays a mean cop or soldier but he did very well in this br br eliza cuthbert and chad michael murray also acted very well as carly and nick jones nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie then eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off ripping her lips apart after they got glued together and getting a straight forward punch in the face by bo br br overall i give this movie an 8 10 fans of horror films must see this
<START> director and fx man john carl doesn't have to do much in order to terrify me the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart br br his lamentable straight to video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop twenty years later and his dvds occupy the same space it seems that the more things change the more they stay the same you can rely on old to serve up dreck whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie making technology br br in this contemptible offering a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of stone aka the forty evil claim jumping cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid 1800s before his death cursed anyone who should find his gold and it's not long before the pick axe wielding killer is back bumping off the hapless treasure seekers br br with its dreadful script unimpressive make up effects and scooby doo style villain 'the curse of the forty is par for the course for only genre stalwarts keren black richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful although i'll forgive alexandra ford who is a complete hottie br br even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on and a lot of the deaths occur off screen which is probably not such a bad thing since the on screen deaths are pathetic br br 'the curse of the forty is another in a long list of duds for john carl
<START> like the other comments says this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of jeunet caro or emir kusturica but have you already seen delicatessen there is nothing new it this film i thought delicatessen was great when it came out but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest i don't think it's a worse film than delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now like it probably would be to watch delicatessen again there is really no point to the film nothing that really matter or stays with you there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica but he's really in a different league so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on
<START> how i deserved to watch this crap worst ever the acting was awful when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile once or twice but if you are to loose hour and a half of your lives this is the right movie i recommend just look in a wall or something anything else but watch this film can even watch a documentary if you are a guy about pregnant women i guarantee it will be more entertaining the actor in this one i forgot his name is not that bad and i am surprised how hi accepted the role anyway i want someone to eat cheese with is the right film if you want to punish someone
<START> this movie is not so good as i thought it would be there is no story whatsoever no characters and some dialog would have been nice the gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top it starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts the music is a classic score and fits the movie very well they should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table and some more info about the would have made this movie far scarier than it is don't expect a scary movie but a nice gory special effects reel
<START> a pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving british club scene sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments but does very little else a perfunctory thriller plot which is there merely to string the club sequences together variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script all stop sorted from being the showcase that director obviously intended br br however although is sometimes over indulgent especially when using the often ill fitting dance music he does show potential and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing overall however the film is a wasted opportunity and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere watchable nevertheless
<START> logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film love love is and am totally confused seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up plastic demon baby what this wasn't love life a little bit dovey for my tastes but a great funny and original film especially liked the ending that didn't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it nine out of ten
<START> i really like the show as a part of greek life i can say that some things are over exaggerated but overall it's still pretty damn funny br br rusty is a likable lead character his roommate is hilarious and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights i like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations br br this show covers it all and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad how else could it be on abc family br br my favorites are of course roommate and pretty much all of kappa tau this show is a great launch pad for them and i'm excited to see what doors this opens br br please renew this show next summer abc family like i said love love love it
<START> the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how and be sorely disappointed it was a vastly more complex show than that br br i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners of course that was before the show hit i did see the that was in the opening go by a few times and with the guy who you see hacking up in the opening too he was a real local yes i'd love to see this on dvd
<START> gold raiders 1951 br br a dull western comedy feature with the three stooges including shemp howard at this point who i've always enjoyed as the third stooge doing their usual schtick and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds who also did some of their funniest classic shorts so one has to wonder just what went wrong this time the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15 minute two reeler comes up as too much for a 55 minute feature film unlike so many of their classic short subjects gold raiders is not worth revisiting br br 1 2 of
<START> in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep hammer's dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of 1972 exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy van helsing an occult disciple named johnny alucard get it get it gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church among them van helsing's great granddaughter jessica and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects dracula in a haze of smoke dracula's only mission is to wreak havoc upon the entire van helsing lineage and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this this is probably the only 70's film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look 70's film considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact we're in the 20th century now and thus he stuffs his film with insufferable hippie characters hideous 70's fashion trends and awful 70's music christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances regretfully show it the opening sequence a flashback and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary the greatest elements in this series of films have always been dracula's dark castles and the exhilarating coach races and obviously this installment lacks all of that luckily for the fans hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better the vampire lovers twins of evil the legend of the seven golden vampires Â not recommended
<START> i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola's masterpiece i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica civic auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for charlie and emilio to leave a concert he was very humble about the praise i shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young captain this is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of american film history charlie don't surf robert duvall's famous line the other one does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his character will long be remembered as a classic american war hawk in the john wayne tradition it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks
<START> evil behind you was created for a specific purpose in mind to shove the writer directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer the way its message is presented almost reminds me of the stories i've heard of the spanish inquisition from one real christian to another avoid this like the plague fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message br br the acting was horrible the selection of muslim terrorists was racist and unfair they're terrorists so they must be muslims the premise of this was good the story provided a great conduit for its message however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak br br you'd be better off dusting off your old ghost dvd with mr swayze to better receive this message at least that movie didn't try to shove itself down your throat or if you like good christian movies with a powerful message try end of the spear
<START> the three stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history for that reason alone they deserved a much better ending at columbia than they received with this short br br sappy bullfighters is just not good granted this is not all joe fault i personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough simply because of the departure from the stooges usual fanfare that they contain and for the fact that larry is sometimes showcased more however this short just will not do and the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown well that just adds to the overall disgust br br this film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them this short is so sloppy it is a simple re make of a curly short what's the matador filmed years before as if this fact wasn't bad enough the studio actually threw in footage of moe and larry from the original which was filmed nearly 20 years prior are these things not obvious laughable or sad you be the judge br br another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a joe besser showcase with him showing that all he is at least in this film is a curly wanna be gone completely wrong moe and larry have little to do in this short as a larry fan i also must say that i feel it a bit disgraceful to have besser get to use the joke that larry originally popularized in the short ants in the pantry to see besser say i can't see i can't see and have larry say the simple why can't you see while besser gets to quip i got my eyes closed is just wrong on all levels br br the two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years howard and fine have so little to do in this short there are hardly any funny bits with them the only thing that qualifies is larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband attempting to be pepe his dog br br one can't blame the dynamic duo larry and moe give it their all no matter how ridiculous things could get and i'm sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers howard and fine never gave anything less than their best their efforts do not pale from 1934 1959 br br i often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible i'm all for their more experimental unusual shorts at least those contain new ideas however this short i think everyone can agree is just not good br br thank goodness tv later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed had they been forced to go out in this fashion well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh
<START> spoilers the killer in the movie doesn't wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied arm as he makes his getaway we then get this official looking prologue as if were watching a true story stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid western collage br br grandfatherly looking and hearing impaired sheriff ron is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students all women continues his run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn there's at least two times when says that they'll never be another murder as long as he's on the case and within minutes another murder happens br br finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff's daughter the collage librarian tina finds this reference book about indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witches cult that originated in the early 1700 just after the salem witch trials this cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local townspeople back in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part when the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual br br you never get a handle to what's exactly happening in the movie blood cult not just because it's totally disjointed story but it's ever more outrageous and grad school level acing especially by charles ellis playing the sheriff ron getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into the bumbling sheriff ends up with his head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive after being dismembered the only reason he wasn't is because he seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug br br there's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the witches cult that's responsible for the sorority murders the movie doesn't bother to explain at all if the dream that the drugged sheriff had was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie br br getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house while munching down a bag full of mcdonald cheeseburgers sheriff finally comes face to face with the killer find out to his shock and amazement that not only does he know who he or she is but he's also willing to let the killer escape br br the very first straight to video motion picture and it shows not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission at least with the video you can tape over it thank god to see this disaster but no movie house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the outraged patrons in a justifiable show of righteous indignation tear the place apart
