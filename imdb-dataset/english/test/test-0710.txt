<START> danny de vito shows us here he is definitely indeed infinitely a better on screen performer than off he plays the part of owen a miserable would be writer with a cranky old mother delightfully played by anne ramsey he would like to see dead billy crystal is larry a very frustrated writing teacher who has an estranged wife he feels the same way about so owen after viewing hitchcock's strangers on a train suggests they swap murders br br as director though de control is inconsistent as he wastes this clever idea while his film lurches from the very humorous to the very bland he and crystal are okay in the lead roles but the show belongs to anne ramsey as the cantankerous mrs lift br br saturday june 20 1992 video
<START> i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie bella martha mostly martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one i miss the slow pace the build up of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog i don't think that the story itself is enough martha kate is more secluded and mario nick is not a clown in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here the small alterations take away the tension my opinion is that you should go and see the original it'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles
<START> if you have ever been has a friend or a kid that is or was into skating at one time then watch this flick i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place a long time ago it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters well skate sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen which the movie does touch on slightly but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating just a person on a board doing it because they love to do it this movie was so inspirational to me that i'm now skating once again i'm 32 and i haven't been this happy with my self in give this one a go you will not be disappointed
<START> the swedish filmmaker roy latest film you the living is not easy to review one of the reasons is that in his own words he has broken with the anglo saxon tradition of story telling in all essence the template of most western film productions another reason might be that although roy is somewhat heavy on symbolisms his unlike those of say andrei tarkovsky are of a more elusive nature it took him 3 years to complete this 86 minute long film and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial troubles or problems with the actors the film consists of 57 vignettes shot mostly by a still camera and it was the careful design of each of these scenes which required much time the imagery of this film which is closely related to the director's previous film songs from the second floor is of utmost importance to the story thus this story is told to a great degree by the surroundings and the environment in which the characters of universe dwell and interact before each scene was finally shot there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors colors dialog etc the result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world which most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream why not dream a little just like in bunuel's the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie when somebody says last night i had a dream you get to watch it but then again what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams br br despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as such the different characters who appear and reappear in different scenes still meet each other and their stories are inevitably intertwined what most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people the trailer trash chain smoking and binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorbike so that she can get away from all this crap her corpulent and mostly silent boyfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but rather absent minded mother members of a brass band whose skill improving efforts at home aren't getting a favorable reception neither from their families nor their neighbors the depressed middle eastern hairdresser and his arrogant customer on his way to a very important business meeting an elderly man having a nightmare about bombers in the skies a young girl dreaming about marrying the young rock star that she is so madly in love with it's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality but it works as much as a statement in support of the austrian philosopher ludwig claims that all human communication is miscommunication people speak to each other but it is as if they speak past each other they try to reach out to the others but shut the others out when those try to reach them br br you the living is a poetic film set physically in stockholm but yet universally applicable the society it portrays is sweden its artistic language and the people displayed are generally unmistakably nordic yet the subject it deals with namely the misery of the humankind in a selfish world reaches far beyond this hemisphere despite the seriousness of its theme the film itself seems a lot more cheerful and laden with humor than one might have expected but in the words of the director himself living is so complicated to each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor hence this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy depending on your sensitivities and not a depressing black reality tour of the human nature it is unusual in its language and structure but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it you will certainly find this film both entertaining and meaningful at the same time it was shown at this year's cannes festival as part of the un certain regard program which offers original and different works outside the competition after the film was shown in the salle debussy the 1 000 strong audience gave it a standing ovation for several minutes do i need to say more
<START> the quickie tells of a decadent russian mob family who lives in malibu and well frankly this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary br br jason leigh introduces herself to mr mob guy as being from pacific exterminators with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say west coast exterminators eventually the mob guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom duh br br in another scene mr plays russian roulette giving a hooker 4000 to bet whether he'll live or die she has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets live well she bets die double duh later she complains it wasn't fair and wants to play again triple duh br br the list of flaws just goes on and on while this intelligence insulting film stinks and sinks in a quagmire of lousy music mediocre camera work poor direction boring story etc pass on this loser d br br note the barebones dvd which i rented had no english same language subtitles or closed captions
<START> ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink well look no further this movie has it all br br racism jokes handicapped jokes overweight jokes suicide jokes murder jokes drug jokes animal abuse jokes eating dirt jokes old man young wife jokes cancer jokes gay jokes crap jokes falling flat on one's face over and over jokes overuse of blood jokes rape jokes pee jokes alcohol abuse jokes anal rash jokes a bunch of people their coffee back up jokes nudity jokes see who can say the most swear words in one scene jokes lesbian jokes girlfriend abuse jokes and the list goes on and on people br br the worst part is none of it is funny not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with it seems that when it just can't get any worst it pushes your expectations to an all new bottom as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse there was one scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time i don't think i need to point out which one but then again i'm sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling br br there was one moment at the end of the movie that actually made sense and was slightly realistic when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled on with the nastiest remains of a trash bag and thrown several feet on the ground only to have a bunch of beer bottles smashed into his head all of this probably when he least deserved it so all thought of a 1 more point redemption was quickly regarded this is indeed a terrible movie this is one that needs to be studied and into small parts at a film school to teach students what not to do
<START> bone eater is set in a small desert town in alabama where property developer dick krantz jim storm is financing the building of a huge resort late one night three of his workers riley timothy starks hansen adrian alvarado miller paul rae are digging foundations in the desert when they unearth what looks like a axe unfortunately for them an ancient native american demon called the bone eater comes along kills them local sheriff steve evans bruce soon has krantz breathing down his neck as the construction of his resort grinds to a halt sheriff evans also has to deal with the bone eater demon as it kills anyone it comes across br br you know i consider myself a fairly big fan of the horror sci fi genre i certainly don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else's unlike many here on the imdb but please believe me when i say that bone eater is the worst sci fi channel 'creature feature' i have ever seen it's up against some damned strong competition as a horror sci fi fan there are two names that when involved with a film send shudders down my spine in anticipation of how bad it will turn out those names are jesus 'i have no talent' franco who had nothing to do with bone eater jim wynorski who directed the absolute disaster that is bone eater in fact bone eater is so bad wynorski hid under the pseudonym bob robertson when a director as bad as wynorski hides under a pseudonym you know the film must be bad where do i even start bone eater is quite simply the worst film i have seen this year is so bad it's untrue the story is awful the script is sloppy at one point sheriff evans tells kia to meet him at the hospital but when they meet there later he acts surprised says 'what are you doing here ' at one point sheriff evans triumphantly claims that we are in the twentieth century that ancient native american demons are nonsense although actually we are in the twenty first century now there's a part when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men awaken the bone eater it kills them but since it killed all three of them how did anyone else know about it for it to be passed down in legend at times it gets more than a little bit embarrassing the character's are horrible clichÃ©s the small town sheriff who saves the day his daughter becomes involved which adds some personal motivation as for the native americans there's an old wise man a young hot head who hates 'white man' a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like storm cloud black hawk the film is as boring as hell nothing happens the story is awful it's full of plot holes lapses in any sort of logic the set pieces are terrible there's no horror or gore or suspense or mystery bone eater is just the sort of film that makes you lose the will to live br br bone eater has some of the worst cgi computer effects i've seen in a while from the daft looking stiff moving bone eater creature itself which is just a selection of bones magically held together to a motorbike jumping a large gap to an awful cgi truck crashing over the edge of a cliff to a van being tossed to one side by the bone eater whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed up he causes a large horse to form from the sand dust rides it in principal this is actually quite a neat idea but it looks awful the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack there is one pointless scene at the end when sheriff evans cuts his own arm why it bleeds but apart from that there isn't a single drop of blood in the thing whenever the bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear in a cloud of dust boring the hilariously goofy climatic showdown between sheriff evans the bone eater has to be seen to be believed sheriff evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse they have a sort of jousting contest which is just to bad to describe properly br br with a supposed budget of about 700 000 bone eater is filmed in a very bland forgettable flat way there's no sense of style here at all the majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight if you watch it on a decent telly then the desert scenery is quite nice on occasion there are several veteran 'known' actors really slumming it here plays exactly the same role as in the similarly themed but much better 'creature feature' terror 2004 william katt will obviously put his name to any crap as long as he gets paid while ex star trek man walter koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this br br bone eater is a truly atrocious 'creature feature' there's really not much more you can say about it other than to steer well clear of it the worst film ever to appear on the sci fi channel that's saying something isn't it
<START> dr ben mckenna james stewart and jo mckenna doris day travel to morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named louis bernard daniel on a bus the next day this man is murdered but before he dies he tells ben a secret an assassination will take place in london the crooks kidnap the couple's son hank christopher olsen making sure ben won't reveal their plan to anybody alfred hitchcock's the man who knew too much 1956 is a very intense thriller the acting is superb as it always is in films james stewart is marvelous doris day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well the song que sera sera has an important part in the movie this movie is a movie of many classic scenes in the final scenes at the albert hall done without dialogue you can barely blink your eyes this movie is fifty years old now time hasn't decreased its power in any way
<START> overall the dad's army movie is very funny although the humour isn't quite as catchy and sparkly as in the tv and radio series so where does this leave us the viewers if you've never seen dad's army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of walmington o s the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side br br for dad's army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a of the tv series but it's a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the bbc video recordings br br the movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe i can't make up my mind if that's a positive or a negative though
<START> one of a few movies filmed at high school in scottsdale az in the late 80's as well as just one of the guys bill and ted's excellent adventure and just perfect which was a segmented movie played during the mickey mouse club movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on br br has gone through an overhaul in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone the field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field one of the few areas still there the internal scenes near the lockers i believe were in the old 200 building br br unless it is playing late at night on the disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick how they ever made sequels to this is beyond me
<START> this moody creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea a great setting as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor onslow stevens the bat changes into a man known as baron in reality count dracula john carradine he seeks dr help to cure him of his vampirism eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse assistant jane adams the wolf man lon chaney and frankenstein's monster glenn strange but dracula's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood and he becomes a jekyll hyde vampire himself this is somewhat better than the prior year's house of frankenstein being less episodic and more exciting visually there's a haunting scene where dracula tries to lure the second nurse martha into his world where she is initially playing moonlight sonata on the piano which soon gives way to terrifying music director uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features two performers are of note stevens with his wonderful voice is at first sympathetic then convincingly menacing adams her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body exhibits great pathos and sympathy it all ends in a slam bang climax typical of 1940s universal horror a little abrupt with footage borrowed from the ghost of frankenstein 1942 i hope universal releases it soon on dvd it was left out of their double feature releases
<START> blind spot one of my festival favorites i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways the cast is great james franco is particularly amazing as the broken hearted boy from los angeles his journal entries which we hear in voice over narration work well with the visuals and are quite intense the film has a powerful style it pushes elements like the road movie and revenge drama in new directions it also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love there is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension strange suspenseful beautiful to look at definitely worth seeing i really would like to see it again periodically i check to see if blind spot has been distributed i can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvd br br pepe 13 08 2005 bologna italy
<START> the acting in this film was of the old school corny and stiff irene dunne is luminous and comes off the best even though she has some very unnatural lines to say still her ability to convey emotion comes through br br old movie buffs will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film through observation of cinematic technique of the 1930s otherwise it is not really that worthwhile
<START> to some of us director ernst lubitsch adored for his underlying and ironic comic touches was rather wet when it came to picking material it isn't that lubitsch is overrated on the contrary he probably was ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative yet the projects he became attached to or was assigned to are not quite the landmarks of comedy his fans like to label them with heaven can wait a screen adaptation of bus play birthday lubitsch is saddled with sleepy don ameche in the lead and the combination of an anemic plot a colorless star and a musty flashback framework the director a wicked man at the turn of the century falls asleep without realizing it presenting the facts of his life in front of hell's entrance ameche wicked that was problem number one the promising opening sequence set in the hades lobby quickly gives way to dreary whimsy and the supporting cast is of little help 1 2 from
<START> i jumped for joy to learn this show ended this show's characters were extremely irritating none of them had one singing redeeming quality damon wayans is probably the most one campbell is campbell she's just as annoying as she was in martin br br the kids are all very annoying as well the oldest is an idiot the oldest girl is a stuck up brat and the youngest is frustrating to listen to br br i guess i did like the intelligent little boy but that's about it br br it did the world a favor by ending br br let's pray that a wayan never stars in another show ever
