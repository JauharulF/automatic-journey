<START> i want to say that i went to this movie with my expectations way too high i thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to bruce almighty which was really funny and it stars steve carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy did it sucked br br the movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people reprising their roles are morgan freeman and steve carell but steve's character is completely different he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy the story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny br br all the actors involved steve carell morgan freeman wanda sykes john goodman ed helms and even jon stewart in a very crappy cameo have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money br br now the plot is obviously shaped after noah's story but there are so many wrong things with it i don't know where to start i guess the big problem is that in the everyone around evan thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him he grows a huge white beard in two days he gets help from animals from all around the world he builds a giant arc in a few weeks in real life people wouldn't be mocking these guy after that they would be saying he is the new noah br br also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie flood ever filmed doing in evan almighty did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie br br jim carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made son of the mask dumb and and now evan almighty br br this was a giant disappointment and tom should be ashamed of himself
<START> i was very impressed with the latest production from mick as a fan of his i was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here he wisely opted with a more subtle broad style of comedy in crackerjack rather than his usual low brow in your face ramblings it is at times inconsistent and un even but a decent script works past that and makes for some entertaining viewing directed by paul moloney who has directed almost every australian tv series imaginable crackerjack tells the story of jack simpson a bloke that belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking when the club hits financial trouble he is forced to bowl in an attempt to raise the funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine haven a familiar and successful formula that is handled well there is no denying that the film owes it's success to the great casting of he seemed to have a great rapport with samuel johnson and excellent chemistry with judith lucy and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality you can't help but wonder why he hadn't tried his arm at film earlier to smooth out the in experienced cast the delightful frank wilson and bill hunter support and often steal their scenes they are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease had it not been for the huge success of 'my big fat greek wedding' crackerjack would have made it to number 1 at the australian box office but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort all in all a witty feel good movie great cast great crew and a great soundtrack combine to make one of the better australian films of 2002 7 10
<START> minor spoilers br br you know it's getting to the point where walt disney television animation might just as well be called walt disney sequel animation these sequels range from excellent beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas and the fantastic lion king ii simba's pride to horrible the return of jafar this is of course my personal opinion now disney brings us their latest sequel adventure and while it is flawed it is still entertaining br br the quality of animation is not up to par with disney feature animation still the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life lady and tramp have not aged a day since 1955 trusty still talks about his sense of smell and ol' reliable and jock still gives him grief about it there's a nice fight between tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor br br i really don't care for most of the songs though roger bart and susan egan the singing voices of scamp and angel sing their parts very nicely both melissa manchester and norman have done much better work in the past danny score is okay but nothing memorable and some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage that is they really don't do much br br the voice work on the other hand is quite good while i don't like jeff bennett as the he is very good as tramp chazz palminteri does a nice job as buster leader of the junkyard gang and alyssa milano gives what may be her best performance as angel then there is scamp who is the spitting image of his dad he is voiced to perfection by scott wolf wolf does a superb job of showing wild streak and his soft side br br all in all while adventure is flawed it still makes for rather entertaining viewing it is my hope however that walt disney television animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases br br
<START> i don't usually comment on films since i am in the movie distribution business but i have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time the acting is fantastic and the script is even better there were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more hollywood james mcavoy is such an outstanding actor i could not look away from him if i tried i was impressed with steven robertson as well i cannot believe this is his first real film brenda fricker plays a small role but as usual she is outstanding this is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are if you like awakenings and mask you will enjoy this story you owe it to yourself to check this film out
<START> skeleton man was okay for the first 5 minutes but as soon as the so called special force agents hit the screen it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a sled br br the opening makes us think we might have a corny yet fun horror flick on our hands but no the film makers ruin any hope of that when the special force agents show up i wish the screenwriter took a different route and had the skeleton man chase down some dim witted teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand instead the skeleton man chases down some dim witted special force agents and offs them until their captain finally gets the upper hand br br i know the whole stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like this br br when the skeleton man finally does meet his so called demise in a building that blows up the captain of the special force agents is asked the following by a police officer outside of the building what the hell happened in there my answer to that question who the hell cares
<START> there needs to be a 0 10 option for bilge like this br br it was painful to watch but strangely compelling all the same compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much i kept thinking it must get better it got worse and worse br br how on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk i'll never know the most surprising thing of all though is all these reviews i see of people actually loving the movie yes the acting was good but the movie was very very very bad worst movie ever
<START> i think that there was too much action in the end don't you think that too there was romance adventure that just like told me to put 9 to this movie but action place was too long i liked reeve a bit i didn't understand why did he have to die i thought that one of the girls gonna die too but my lucky no one else who i liked didn't die how about you what did you liked i saw the movie twice actually and after that i bought that too it was worth it who did you liked best person the book was really really really cool and the actresses and actors too everything was perfect what was the song name in the end will someone answer my questions too please please please
<START> director jay craven's adaptation of howard frank 'where the rivers flow north' is one of the finer transitions from literature to the screen craven is an admirer of work he also directed 'a stranger in the kingdom' br br the cast is superb especially rip torn and cardinal torn offers what could be the finest role of his career noel lord the fiercely independent former lumberjack who is at the center of this story portrayal of lord's live in housekeeper common law wife is dead on as well i'm both amazed and disappointed that neither of them were nominated for oscars when this film was released performances of this calibre should be acknowledged the only character that's a little hard to swallow for me is the power company executive played by michael j fox he just looks too much like a kid in this role i guess there's a curse attached to youthful looks no matter how much people want them br br craven has done a nice job here in bringing the character of early 20th century vermont to the screen locations angles sets all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story cinematographer paul ryan was exceptional the score by the is also first rate it fits the mood and scenery perfectly br br and the story itself one of the most compelling portrayals of the fiercely independent american pioneer spirit ever a trait that is on the wane in this day and age when it appears in modern times the person is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain in noel lord we have a character whom we can admire for his values and even for his stubbornness br br this is not a stodgy but a vibrant look at an era that is gone and a type of character that has all but vanished these are not gold plated heroes but real people with both strengths and weaknesses at play within them struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live like today there are those who wield power that would have it otherwise
<START> i was lucky enough to see a test screening of 'el a couple months ago in santa monica i was blown away you don't see films like this anymore in the vein of deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of proportions the characters are complex and conflicted the emotions are real the action is fast and furious the stunts are expansive and tilly is hot she hasn't looked this good since her days i'd recommend this to anyone it's a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s and to all the naysayers out thereÂ watch it again you obviously had your eyes closed the first time congrats to all involved in the film i'm counting the days until the sequel is released anyone have a date on that
<START> the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully morning blessings are recited but only the ones gitai finds controversial the rest are conveniently omitted then while in and a he kisses his wife good morning this is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home let alone a home amos is not interested in accurately portraying life he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films the ritual bath scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a wedding i have many problems with the way of life but i have no use for amos commentary on these issues he would have you think that the are all dense with severe bouts of depression i may not agree with the lifestyle but i acknowledge that life has many layers amos gitai is blinded by his own pseudo intellectual stubborness and is therefore incapable of portraying an accurate of life aside from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of life gitai fails in other aspects as well the plot is full of holes the dialogue loaded with silence the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times powerfull was too often loaded with melodrama the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for watch if you must but be warned if you want to learn about life go to the communities and talk to do not rely on film
<START> most likely cleopatra will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it was broadcast and i don't think that many people did but if you are still somewhat intrigued it is a buck rogers in the 25th century premise without space ships and with no budget for wardrobe or production design br br in this case the buck rogers part cleopatra is played by jennifer sky which one might expect to be a good thing as jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented and has a nice comedic touch but a quick glance at the promotional material will show that she is somewhat the worse for having a bad haircut and a salvation army thrift store wardrobe if you remember how fetching jennifer was during her time on xena her dowdy cleopatra look will be a huge disappointment with a target audience of teenage boys looking to burn their eyeballs looking at hot fetish attired girls it is not a good idea to skimp on the exploitation value of your heroine or her costume and they wonder why some series don't attract much of an audience love it or hate it buck rogers had hotter costumes and much better looking guest stars br br the other two exploitation elements are two female associates hel gina torres basically playing her stock firefly character and sarge victoria pratt another xena connection an extremely wooden version of natasha henstridge torres does a good job playing off the cleopatra character providing most of the show's comic relief br br torres sings the theme song a somewhat lame parody of rick in the year and terminus 1969 you remember the one that opens with the words in the year if man is still alive if woman can survive they may find i suspect that they gave the series its title so that they could butcher this catchy little song although who knows perhaps the title is a homage to buck rogers and they thought of using the song later br br so the premise of the show is that the earth's surface has been taken over by aliens called not the wkrp one and the humans have been driven underground our three heroines fight against the under the direction of a disembodied presumably female voice appropriately referred to as voice unlike buck rogers cleopatra is kind of a wimpy third stooge still dazed and confused from her sleep or maybe just disoriented from the creepy haircut there are a lot of nice close ups of sky wide eyed and bewildered like buck rogers the running gag is cleopatra using a common 21st century expression and everyone finding it either totally profound or completely baffling br br unlike firefly the action is more of that hyper edited xena garbage which is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining one good gimmick is that the girls travel around spiderman fashion a sort of web slinging through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world br br strangely or maybe not considering the budget these are only half hour episodes and except for one two part show there is not enough time for any subtlety and nuance br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> seeing this show gives me respect for mtv though i imagine that mtv sees this random edgy material as its main selling point and is much less concerned with the pertinent truths it expresses br br i write and play music for a living and this show gets me really emotionally riled up for me serves a completely distinct function from most tv instead of dulling or distracting the senses which can be often really nice at times it awakens my spirit of right and wrong it makes me very uncomfortable but in a very comforting way br br i don't think a lot of viewers absorb most of this show's content but if they do kudos to television viewers everywhere
<START> i don't know if this exceptionally dull movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to 'the french connection but it does have many of the same drawbacks the script is so confusing that the viewer remains uninvolved and feels left out of the picture and the direction is so cold so lacking in energy that even the great chase sequence can't liven things up 1 2
<START> ahem i think i'll be the only one who's saying this but yes i was a lil bored during the film not to say that this is a bad movie in fact it's a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions dilemma sorrow love esp it's the director's debut read from somewhere is it true i felt that something's not quite right maybe it's just me i'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world this is a simple story about ordinary people ordinary lives through simple and short dialogs the director tries to relate a simple guy's life and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man i must say i didn't feel the impact that most readers felt in fact i was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they're comfortable with each other the granny who came back for another shot this is kinda melancholic the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad hmm but this is predictable don't misunderstood that i'm an action lover independent films are my cup of tea perhaps i just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery some asian films worth the watch br br tony depicts loneliness wayward cloud only 1 dialog my sassy girl i like it 4 30 loneliness as well 15 gangsters lives in local setting before sunrise and before sunset i just have to mention these even though they are not asian films fans will understand
<START> when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
