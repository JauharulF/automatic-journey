<START> what an embarassment this doesnt do justice to the original with awful acting from everyone in this movie hitchcock must be spinning in his grave the where marion gets killed in the shower is just so uneffective and unoriginal the only good bit is that they used the same music and its so obvious who kills her in the shower i rate this movie 3 10
<START> oliver stone always ready to make politically themed movies makes another one here talk radio is loosely based on the career of alan berg a radio talk show host in denver who was murdered by white supremacists in this case the character is barry eric bogosian an outspoken talk show host in dallas who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in as it is most of the people who call in are a bunch of racists and things may be heating up more than anyone realizes br br performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie i really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck who calls in granted i wouldn't call this oliver stone's greatest movie ever but it's a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated good performances by ellen greene and alec baldwin also help
<START> this movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named curtis killing people the other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge brown ugly glasses the actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to revenge of the nerds br br another thing that i hate so much about this movie is that curtis takes his sweet time shooting people i kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice he sounded like he was fourteen and not ten another thing i hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that br br then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there that didn't make any sense and neither did the music the music didn't fit any of the scenes br br this movie is slow boring and a waste of time watch a different movie on your birthday
<START> if you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen you are a better filmgoer than i br br count the logic lapses common sense leaps and credibility stretches betcha need more than two hands br br p s if one more film uses a location that is clearly ucla and claims that it is a different university in this movie's case berkeley i'm going to lose it
<START> the promotions for clubbed project a slick looking film based around the clubbing scene of the 1980's what we end up with is a film with identity issues the sub plots end up taking over from what viewers would assume to be the main plot so the focus on this film being mainly about clubbing ends up being left in the gutter br br boxing depression self loathing gangsters bouncers and drug deals are all hastily crammed into 90 odd minutes on no less than 4 occasions i had to check the run time of the film as the worry grew that this film was bound to disappoint br br what club scenes we do see are bland and repetitive featuring approximately 3 extras dancing in what is barely recognisable as a club hardly capturing the vibe of the day br br if you're looking for a film about the 80's club scene something along the lines of what human traffic did for the late 90's forget clubbed
<START> this movie was obscenely obvious and predictable the scenes were poorly written and acted even worse following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines i would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies this movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the bachelor and bachelorette but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before the casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change the channel quickly as a note please don't watch this movie
<START> i am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much i detested this movie the historical trial of henriette and the duc de is a tragic and compelling story that i feel had the potential to be a fantastic film but failed br br although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters the worst of them were the children who were so over the top corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch br br in conclusion this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed
<START> to start i'm not a person to rate movies that i haven't seen nor am i a person that rates movies 1's when they don't deserve it this movie was really that bad the basic plot was extremely formulaic and while it wasn't great the plot deserved about a 5 the part that really bothered me was anything referencing swimming in the film i compiled a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this film br br 1 no character development 2 no sense of time 3 completely inaccurate swimming scenes which include a a team of six swimmer going to something called both nationals and regional with no mention of how they qualify b this same team going to whatever the hell this meet was without swimming a real meet at any point in the film c the rival program goes from being a high school to a club team back to a high school and then a club team again d in the scene where ellis is interviewing for a job the banners show high school state wins and placements at nationals yet the team consists of anywhere from 5 to 12 swimmers depending on which of the 3 meets are happening e a team of 5 guys and a girl win nationals regions whatever f said girl wins a men's 100 butterfly event g in this race said girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top 3 in the nation h the announcer changes a race from the 200 breast to the 100 breast back to the 200 again in the span on about 45 seconds i in the final relay the which is being in a 50 meter long course pool one swimmer is seen doing two flip turns j in this same relay the teams anchor swimmer freaks out and steps off the blocks prompting an inspirational pep talk which lasts for about two and a half minutes or about 3 times as long as the leg would take at a national caliber meet k the movie begins in the month of july or august assuming that ellis was applying before the school year started and the pool was to be closed in 3 months so assuming these things both hold true the swimmers went from not being able to swim to winning nationals regional whatever in less than two as the pool had to be cleaned and the kids didn't start practicing for a while l i'm sure there are a couple hundred more i'm just trying to block them out of my memory 4 throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmers time 5 if you're going to have a movie about swimming it would be a good idea to hire extras that know how to swim well 6 the scene where the kid is kicked underwater is physically impossible br br that being said all the swimming scenes were way too slow swimmers had horrible technique and the idea of being able to qualify for a national meet within three months of learning to swim is just insulting to swimmers everywhere br br ok if you still don't believe me let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst films i have ever seen and this is coming from the guy that owns gigli soul plane manos the hands of fate skullduggery and any number of other total piece of crap that have been put on film please don't go
<START> big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages even adults i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too frankie is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious overall a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time
<START> in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached was the product of odder and odder material selected for here it's past life regression esp and therapy pretty loopy the real problem with the concept music or not are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes just where can a movie go and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand it can't go any place new but strangely it can't even go any place old indeed if it could audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand playing a much older arrogant french ass and streisand a much younger girl we never become invested in them their situations or outcomes montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible br br it's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable it's not even adapted from a non musical story that met with any previous success that's just too passe streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance but she over relies on her ingratiating translation irritating kooky jewish girl shtick she can however sing very well at both the gentle and powerhouse ends of the range amidst a score of musical dross she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer 'he isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz hart's 'my funny valentine ' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between and melinda br br the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film strong research shows a longer better explained and more decorative but not necessarily a better film at http barbra archives com films clear day streisand 2 html you can be sure there's be more babs in that version but more importantly there'd be more thoughtful work from minelli br br in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self esteem to allow himself off the hook and she takes the bait so uh hooray for that br br hurry it's lovely up here love with all the trimmings he isn't you the title song
<START> horrible misogynist drivel my neighbor brought this turkey over subjected me to it and didn't have the courtesy to apologize the plot was laughable my four year old could write a better movie
<START> at times i really when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have i've just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film br br the film needs some patience yes and yes the main character is really annoying but that i'm sure is by intention br br maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music this movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise br br and no good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together and while that doesn't work out perfectly at least i think it works quite good br br i liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times the opening scene is really special br br i also liked the acting Â guillaume depardieu is not playing pierre he is acting the role of a pierre who is himself playing a role pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and self righteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect that even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself br br people are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff no character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone br br and even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen remember that isabelle fled from a war zone and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely bosnia which was still going on when the film was produced at least that's what is hinted at by the story isabelle tells pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where pierre shows isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on bosnia
<START> this film had some very funny moments the aforementioned feeb sketch for starters br br the parts where tries to act dignified in front of his guests looking down at them through his nose very subtly done especially as the guest was a toffee nosed adulterer himself br br the scene where finds out that gina has a fiancÃ© ahhh she was stringing me along all the time the brazen hussy with his 2 candle eyes like as if she really fancied him but he believed it that's why it was so funny great moment br br gino was also excellent he should have been used more as the bad man where are the whores i ordered he bellows brilliant stuff
<START> after getting hooked on the mini series north south i could hardly wait for the continuation north south ii then years later along came book iii heaven hell north south book iii finally the last installment came for the on going saga of the maine and hazard families i was so enraptured by this series that i taped each part off of tv and then managed to get family and friends hooked and i watched it again each time someone new wanted to see them my tapes are old and i crave this trilogy on dvd if you missed book iii you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out do yourself a favor and demand this set on dvd
<START> while out for water a young psychic woman named jessica burns carolyn stumbles upon something else altogether she discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for the chest contains the head of gideon drew a devil worshiper who was beheaded by sir francis drake telepathically controlling the hired hand who opened the chest drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body Â also buried on jessica's aunt's farm while jessica is certain she feels the presence of evil can she put a stop to drew's plans and will she be in time to prevent his becoming whole br br i thought i was fairly familiar with most of universal's horror output prior to 1960 but this is one universal film from the 50s that certainly gets little mention while the thing that couldn't die isn't what i would call a good movie it does have a few things going for it first the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious director will cowan whether by luck or intention is able to give the movie some nice atmosphere from time to time and the special effects involving the head are certainly creepy but the whole project is undone by the acting i'm shocked to learn that any of the supposed actors in this thing ever appeared in anything else you would think that this was a one and done type of movie for most of those involved is the worst offender she's horrible also the thing that couldn't die may have been a bit too ambitious for its own good given the budget and other limitations there was no way the movie could aspire to its more lofty ideas finally the movie ends rather abruptly just as things are starting to get interesting the end what's that about
