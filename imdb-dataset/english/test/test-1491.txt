<START> forced cloying formulaic do these adjectives make you want to run to rent his miriam hopkins was brilliant in the original dr and mr hyde a few other early movies of hers notably the story of temple drake are never shown but said to be excellent br br here she is cutesy bossy and thoroughly unappealing ray milland as a village bohemian not at all convincing br br the two child performers are creepy and also bear no relation to the village as it was then br br speaking as a native of greenwich village i find the setting ersatz generic and phony not that i was around for a couple generations but my relatives were there in 1937 it isn't funny it isn't remotely authentic we don't care about the characters br br so many movies were made about the struggling masses vs the capitalists at this time and done with elan easy living comes to mind it didn't take place in the village but it rings very true this rings with a thudding knell
<START> begotten is black and white distorted images it looks like it could have come from the nineteenth century however the sound is crystal clear minus the sync and the addition of calm nature sounds br br this movie was very critical of the struggles of life it shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent the mother is very oblivious to her surroundings this leads to lots of torture pain and death you may watch it many times and see different symbolisms plot devices and basically what does it mean br br if you appreciate art in movies then you will love it otherwise don't bother
<START> one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's dirty dancing was a low budget film with high budget returns with a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance to a love story that all of us wish we could live at least if you're female this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again br br the music which is what drives the movie is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer from classic '60's hits like love man by otis redding and big girls don't cry by frankie valli to pure '80's hits like eric hungry eyes and frank overload dirty dancing is a mix of fun and sensual showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more br br the dancing in dirty dancing is not to be forgotten cynthia rhodes shines in her role as penny a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts patrick swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills not just as an actor but dancer and singer as well and jennifer grey shines as baby while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well br br all in all dirty dancing is one of the best movies of all time and well worth watching at least once it's doubtful that the first beats of the be my baby in the opening title won't snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment
<START> i want to believe all new horror films coming out of japan these days are edgy and make for enjoyable watching br br spider forest is neither br br it is seldom that i finish watching something and end up off for the waste of time but spider forest was an exception in this regard i was very off the makers of the film succeeded on one level throughout the film i could not stop because i wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun by the storyline i could not stop watching that's why i was so angry when the film finished they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this warning spider forest is another one of those japanese ghost stories though you don't realize that going in br br i never want to see a japanese ghost story again they're phony and contrived it's a ghost story has become like a big rug under which to sweep any and all plot holes you have in your story telling
<START> the name of bad company's greatest hits album is called 10 from 6 you could have just turned up this album and cut the sound on this movie most of the songs played in the movie were from this album i guess oldsters during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the 1930s and 1940s that's how i feel about movies made about the 1970s the characters in the movie looked like they were auditioning for danny why is it that movies have to exaggerate the 1970s the only good period piece i liked was freaks and geeks they cut that television show it was exactly like things were in high school when i was there back circa 1980 i was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like this it was totally youth dominated there were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and about the inner city of philly that was more the 70s that i remember as a kid this movie was very dull and cheesy at times i was falling asleep i don't know why an actor who was acting during the 70s appeared in this one he was probably trying to lend it some credibility walken didn't even show up until the second half i guess the only true thing about the movie was the baby boomers were are a spoiled lot all the kids in the movie were spoiled brats i don't know what they had against their father
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye' and this movie delivers that in spades glenn ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about when the ranch hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything ford seems at first reluctant to do anything his men to not take things into their own hands but that's just what he is about to do i knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy richard jaeckel one of my very favorite bad guy character actors who had killed his ranch hand after a gentle exchange of dialog with him glenn ford slaps his face and shoots him dead kind of a neat added bit of justice he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand in short order we're treated to ford letting his ranch be burned so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch then ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch then they show up and burn the and the big fancy house to the ground talk about getting even big time lots of action in this movie there's more to the story than this but i'll just recommend you watch the movie glenn ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone and i really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way
<START> about as hilarious as 50s british comedy can get the belles of st has almost a gag a minute and at 91 minutes makes for a terrific time other films i equally recommend of the same period are the titfield thunderbolt and the green man in fact any film with alistair sim or terry thomas george cole richard or joyce or any combination is a delight in st we get a double dose of sims playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets ripple across his face joyce as ruby gates oh dear that name plays her hockey constable incognito to hilarious perfection possibly the best laughs come from george cole as flash harry who comes out of a bush when whistled at and various visits to classrooms by ms sims reacting to explosions 'oh poor betty or science lab gin production just send a few bottles of that up to my room ' every part of the film is funny from the characters their costumes the antics and the setting there were sequels but the first three are the best including this one blue murder at st and later in color the great st train robbery
<START> warning this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids br br the artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter unfortunately in so many ways this guy was also a jerk in so many ways some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art but other times he was simply a drunk jerk especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist late in the film his being annoying abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished while all this didn't make him a particularly nice man it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist br br i really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie like in lust for life i really wish i could show this to my students i teach at a school for the arts but can't because there is just too much adult material yes there is nudity but even more problematic for any audience particularly younger ones is when he hmmm i don't think imdb will even let me describe what occurred but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did not need to be seen but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film it's a real shame
<START> i think this was the most outstanding edge of your seat thriller that i have seen in a long time the research for the film was thorough the writer kelly sane has left no loose ends the cast was seasoned fantastic performances all round omar was outstanding br br the cinematography is poetic music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfying br br rendition goes into territory that even the media fears to tread it is really a wakeup call for those involved with espionage and the legal web that is the war on terror br br a woman walked out of the theater and asked me does this really happen that in itself speaks of gavin hood's masterful achievement
<START> the plot is very basic but acceptable a young us soldier having studied asian martial arts puts this to good use in defence of the general's daughter and falls in love with her unfortunately the three main acting parties' soldier girl rebels combined iq amounts to 3 one point for the soldier one for the girl a large number of ninja fighters have to share the third point among them to be able to lose against the former two
<START> what symbolism exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brother's paean to ingmar bergman some symbolism is there all right but not much northfork adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls br br northfork is a town facing extinction after a new dam goes into operation it's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for the untouchables have the job of relocating dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving an exciting anti development movie is always a possibility but let's get real rural is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history can be built without forced relocation not in this country br br but this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear br br alternating between the black suited evacuation agents working for land when the dam creates that valuable and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly br br the cinematography is poor a washed out subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly indeed a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective br br 4 10
<START> charlie's wilson's war demonstrates with deft veracity just how futile wars can be especially to the very people who spend countless hours and finances to fund them virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a riotously sarcastic script catapult the film helmed by the continuously unpredictable mike nichols to the top of the year's best politics has never been so much fun br br charlie wilson tom hanks is a texas congressman who is credited with almost single handedly winning the cold war hanging around plenty of drugs women and scotch he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in afghanistan and the terrors of the soviet union in the 1980s enlisting the help of gust philip seymour hoffman a renegade cia covert mission expert and joanne julia roberts a wealthy socialite he raises money to provide afghanistan with the rocket launchers and weaponry they need to cause serious damage to russian military eventually by the end of the 80s the cold war would come to an end and the funds would immediately be cut thereby removing all help for the fledgling country to rebuild and recoup br br the acting is exquisite although it's to be expected from the more than accomplished cast a large part of that however should be attributed to the script which allows each character to be undeniably well developed and memorable and a hearty helping of that credit goes to the novel of the same name which is hilariously honest tom hanks delivers yet another unequaled performance as charlie wilson the man who did so much for so many and yet still remains relatively unknown philip seymour hoffman plays gust a character that is vividly boffo in both his physicality and his wry cynicism the inimitable hoffman once again shows superb range in the characters he portrays julia roberts is perhaps the only weak link of the film with her generic snobbish character and not subtle enough accent and then there's wilson's squad of young secretaries that scamper about to keep him happy led by the always delightful amy adams each supporting role has its moments br br defeating the soviet union was not an easy task especially considering the many conflicting goals between the various political leaders why is congress saying one thing and doing nothing queries a disgruntled politician tradition mostly returns wilson everyone appears to want the cold war to end yet a blind eye is being turned to the atrocities taking place in afghanistan it takes a trip to the war torn refugee camps in pakistan to motivate wilson as well as with his main financial source doc long ned beatty wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise funding of weaponry in afghanistan from 5 million to 10 million with a simple command but the president of pakistan scoffs at the idea of winning a war for such a trivial amount by the end of the wilson campaign 1 billion is sent to the mujahedin to shoot down russian helicopters the first step toward victory as wilson predicted beyond the scope of the film the unresolved turmoil in afghanistan led to further less problems which wilson presumably br br during the course of charlie wilson's war the main characters travel from the united states to pakistan to afghanistan to jerusalem to egypt but wherever they go sarcasm always follows there's a surprising amount of comedy in the film considering the political undertones are generally serious hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue as does hanks with his naturally witty woman chasing ideals a scene early on featuring gust being continually ushered in out of wilson's office as he tries to straighten out a legal issue with his posse of gorgeous gals you can teach 'em to type but you can't teach 'em to grow tits reminds me of a slapstick routine from the marx brothers br br with the press focusing on the drug allegations against wilson instead of the important issues of the cold war and the conflicting desire of officials to budget their help it's clear that by the end of the film the politicians are still oblivious to what's really necessary and since the screenplay is so quick witted and astute some audience members may not be able to keep up with all of the dialogue intensive events but as demonstrated by the politicians who are ignorant as to the difference between pakistan and afghanistan it's essentially another argument to support charlie wilson's point br br mike
<START> horrible all i can say is that is movie was horrible i came to watch this movie half expecting some good acting all i got was a horrible movie this movie deserved to stay on the cutting room floor i do not recommend this movie to anybody i have seen better by the actors
<START> my friends and i rented this movie mistaking it for another one about skateboarding watchin steve guttenberg as an action hero is hilarious the movie is so incredibly predictable and over the top that it ended up being a laugh fest even though i gave it a 1 10 this movie should be seen especially if u manage to catch it on tv anywhere
<START> i can't praise this film enough it had a lot of that hand held first person shaking camera which i love and some hate because it makes them sick like rec cloverfield and blair witch project br br it is a long movie for its kind but i didn't even notice because the film was so interesting by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter's work the movie keeps up the pace making it a real time experience for the viewer br br while i would never call this film the scariest horror ever made i'd have to say it's certainly one of the best i've seen the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images camera glitches events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations the ending is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards a second viewing is highly recommended though br br watch this one alone in the dark don't expect anything and you'll have fun
