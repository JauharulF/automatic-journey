<START> this is an excellent movie and i wish that they would put it out on dvd for people to purchase it is difficult to try to catch it on tv all the time as you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it can someone tell me what file company make it so i can write to them and see if they will release it to the public i only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and i only got to see it once last year my sisters and i are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos john denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great they put out some much older movies and i think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and i think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on dvd
<START> i turned 13 when elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first rca hit a year later buddy holly stepped in to give the king some competition one of buddy's major talents besides his unique singing style and his songwriting ability is often downplayed buddy was also a skilled lead guitar player developing a unique rockabilly style all his own on his fender gary busey attempts to capture this aspect of buddy's persona there were other contemporary master guitar rockers of equal caliber such as chuck berry carl perkins and eddie cochran but buddy's talent is often overlooked br br as noted by others busey is the driving force behind the success of the buddy holly story not only does the script play with the facts of buddy's life but it even several anachronisms for the two years of buddy's popularity basically 1957 1959 one that comes to mind is the scene where buddy and maria are watching a 3 d movie buddy is disenchanted with it all and tells maria that it'll never last it's just a fad in reality there were no 3 d movies in circulation at the time the heyday for 3 d was in the early 1950's by 1955 the fad had already faded yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believable br br at times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding buddy's career the story about how the crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie another problem with the film is how buddy's parents are depicted certainly buddy's parents were supportive of his musical career maybe baby is credited to buddy's mother and she did have input into the writing of the song br br it's good that buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie but i miss hearing one of my favorites i'm looking for someone to love i'm proud that as a result of this movie buddy's music was reissued for a new generation to hear his legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock 'n' roll rave on buddy rave on
<START> saw the movie last night w o knowing anything about it nothing else out seemed interesting and i had a buffalo connection to this movie ub grad it was a very enjoyable movie liked the pace it picks up after a slow beginning and story well written plot and good character development and relationships highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers most discussions don't last more than a few minutes
<START> i really like traci lords she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this she play the dowdy conservative reporter to a 't' it's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while jeff fahey is also good as traci's boss i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress she's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies
<START> maybe i expected too much of this film but at the very least a comedy should be funny and this one has very few amusing moments it manages to be insulting to homosexuals heterosexuals women the obese and probably several other groups as well the scene at graduation where everyone claims to be gay is one of the most distasteful i have ever seen br br tom selleck and matt dillon are ridiculously miscast and kevin kline seems bemused most of the time br br other reviewers compare the film to will and grace but at least will and grace is funny
<START> absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of outside of a battle of britain reenactment no less than eight flying spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences br br those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty eyed reciting high flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast free and high in their dark blue world be warned romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie the core message is one that is shared by many war vets in that their finest hours their period of life when they felt most alive was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray br br the plot concerns czech pilots who escape from their country when the nazis invade and join the raf free czech squadron there are a few subplots all of which are worth careful attention this is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti hardware romantic will love keep the kleenex on hand beautiful photography first rate acting accurate details of raf life during the battle of britain easily a candidate for any aviation personal dvd collection
<START> god bless joe d'amato i love italian horror cheese movie wise sci fi etc br br this one admittedly was a bit harder to watch but another fun bad movie br br i like how people preface a negative review with i normally enjoy bad movies but no buts this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies it's one of my top bad movies br br miles o'keefe was a poor man's conan but oh what fun who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb a and a cheesy rubber monster it's fine to hate this movie if you only like hollywood drek like titanic or pretty woman but if you truly i mean truly love bad movies check this one out br br this is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun br br my rating 8 10
<START> certainly this film is not for everybody but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film buy this immediately where else can you get a run down of fashion a period vocabulary primer karate trained hookers crime a rap about the sinking shoot outs and a co star named queen bee watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office with a filming style a cross between a porno movie dawn of the dead and car wash you cannot go wrong this is one to watch over and over you put the kids to bed
<START> i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping dictionary one reviewer on four word film review www com got it right right when he wrote from a to the story is about an english colonialist jerk that comes to malaysia to the savages so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary a sleeping dictionary is a native malaysian prostitute fluent in english that services englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for well the movie never really makes that clear but i can only assume he gives her money or something needless to say the movie focuses a lot more on the sleeping part than on the dictionary part of the job description things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture his soap opera domestic situation and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film br br so yes the movie has some major flaws but on the other hand it delivered exactly the two things i rented it for in the first place a beautifully photographed exotic location and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary jessica alba my friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right she's not a great actress and doesn't quite pass for malaysian and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity but who cares jessica alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy but also beautiful in the way that a vivaldi violin concerto or a rembrandt painting is br br p s sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage women the male gaze etc etc but i hope you can understand that i mean no disrespect
<START> note to self never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it great comedian horrible seal this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why charlie sheen there are possibilities for a very passionate story here but sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments
<START> this was really a nightmare of a film i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since pixote is a 10 year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo brazil and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends and chico they steal pimp sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day in the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids one night boyfriend is killed after a beating so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot the rest of the film shows descent into a criminal life he doesn't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives but there is however a gentle scene in the middle of the film pixote and his friends are at the beach missing and wishing one of his friends from the reformatory was there i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend but for a better life director hector pixote is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people including myself tend to ignore or misunderstand this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person
<START> a good friend of mine one said a monkey is funny anytime anywhere there is one exception to this going bananas it is quite simply the worst movie i have ever seen it's worse than plan 9 worse than the beast of yucca flats it is terrible the talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes and believe me that's all there is make sure you have a bunch of people around to revive you after you go into toxic shock from going bananas the worst movie ever
<START> congo is another multi dollar adaptation of crichton's works like jurassic park the lost world sphere etc the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence i'll make this short and to the point the scenery is beautiful the actors well it's the best they can do the script try hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and congo falls somewhere below that there were some silly moments like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava and amy raised by humans surrounded by humans yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her what sort of twist of common sense is that which brings me to this if there was an annoying character in every movie amy ranks of one here you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her neat idea but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk congo is worthwhile to see and not deplorable but certainly not a memorable film either
<START> watching plots with a view called undertaking betty in the us i got the feeling that there need to be more movies filmed in wales this one portrays a woman brenda blethyn in a small welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband so she and the funeral parlor manager alfred molina come up with a plan but there are likely to be some glitches along the way br br i would actually say that christopher walken's character is the neatest in the movie how could he not be but overall the whole idea is just a really neat one stacked with some uh oh moments especially the haunted house scene it's the sort of movie that i wish that i could enter just to experience it br br also starring lee evans naomi watts and miriam
<START> as i peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the imdb have posted on this film i find it very interesting how few middle of the road comments there are everyone either loves it or they hate it having seen apocalypse now approximately 30 times and having recently dissected it on dvd how did we ever live without those magical digital machines i can say without hesitation that i am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film why would you like a film that's so confusing ask many of my associates the answer is this forget the war forget the brutality this is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done they big brother sent him out to do the job he does it too well without adhering to the accepted standards of death and destruction am i the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have for death and destruction so they send the conformity police out to eliminate the individual hmmmmmm draw any parallels between this and things you see every day with the deepest respect to mr coppola whom i believe is one of the best directors of all time i think he transcended his original intent of the movie and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released the subtle sub text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed instead it seems to have itself like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden again i must reiterate i think ff coppola did a bang up job on this entire production as did the cast and crew but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten fold so if you haven't seen the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more times and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life only then make a judgment on the quality of the film those of you that have seen it watch it again with the mindset previously described i think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film or maybe not no matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to coppola for his masterful story telling style
