<START> almost missed it while visiting friends in philadelphia sometime in the early 1980 s i was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed it wasn t just bogart he was obsessed with but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well add to that a plot liken to the maltese falcon where so many different characters were interacting with sacchi and you have a piece of art as far as i m concerned about ten years later it appeared on tv and i taped it
<START> this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making the pacing is poor the budget must have been depressingly low and the acting is cut rate that is except for bela lugosi the audio at this point in time is also terrible with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie if these things bother you at all don't watch this film br br if you can get past this however you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one a german plastic surgeon bela lugosi was hired by the japanese to operate on several japanese agents and turn them into the of upstanding american businessmen whom the japanese have kidnapped and killed after completing his work he was betrayed by the japanese and thrown into prison he later escapes and travels to america to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly publicized murders br br it seemed as though bela lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and to be honest the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy the leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical while the police officer assigned to her case was the common chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period br br i also found that the camera work was completely uninspired often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again after a while this tends to drag the film down setting a very slow pace for the action which is more or less non existent anyway br br to me the idea is a fascinating one and with a better writer director script equipment and actors it could become an excellent film sadly these handicaps keep the film back for now and i can't recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers
<START> i strongly recommend it to anybody who likes good plots good actors even if not well known often it's just better that way science and or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on the small screen good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it br br much better than any war in the stars br br there was only one comment which was not necessary talking about the comet the commentator says that life was maybe brought on earth through a comet that's fun there must be always a chance for a magic way huh that's what's great about life can come anywhere no need of force
<START> i enjoyed the movie and the story immensely i have seen the original 1939 i believe and enjoyed them both to really appreciate the story one must be familiar with english culture and customs the prof peter o'toole was dedicated to his school and the boys in that school it was an english public school which we in the u s refer to as a private school e g he is a very person and on the surface gives the appearance of being stiff stuffy uncaring and weak to the point of being effeminate he is strict in his educational standards because he does care for his lads i e he doesn't want them to get a cheap or weak education he meets through introduction a dance hall girl clark and is totally smitten in england at the time the reference to dance hall carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely lower class we find that the prof is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and institutions that he loves and or respects clark becomes more than a lover and wife she his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness the first movie was set before ww ii this one goes through ww ii also it is 1969 we've had the british invasion beetles etc clark had hits and was very popular then still is to me the music is great color and photography excellent i think o'toole played the character perfectly there are dedicated people like chips all around us but many do not receive the recognition very enjoyable movie and story
<START> in this film i prefer deacon frost he's so sexy i love his glacial eyes i like stephen dorff and the vampires so i went to see it i hope to see a gothic film with him blade it was very about the future if vampires had been real i would be turned by frost
<START> i didn't personally know karen carpenter nor richard for that matter so i must go by how the movie portrayed her i think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother richard however from what i did see and learn of karen i felt her pain share her sadness and she was a very special person to me growing up i know that i wasn't born until 1965 so i didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but i definitely grew up listening to her music and i have fond memories of her music i remember the song about the radio every sha la la la every whoa so fine etc and i remember we've only just begun as a matter of fact i memorized many many of her songs and some people quite a few tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her i am not joking on this i also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college 1978 1987 to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987 i developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying karen in the movie the mother agnes was very much like my mother in many ways and i could also feel the pain that karen must have experienced for my mother was often unfeeling critical and disapproving as agnes was if this was true to accuracy the movie was helpful in identifying and getting to know karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through it is quite difficult to portray a person's entire life in 2 3 hours and recount every single detail perfectly so i would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate i will give this story an 8 though i wish i did know karen personally i would have died to meet her i would have loved to have shook her hand given her a hug or talked to her i feel her warmth and love every time i hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed
<START> this movie starts out as if it were a comedy it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards especially in the airport sequence william smith plays the role of a hunter who is quite twisted and deranged smith seems to always play villains such as in the ultimate warrior 1975 and the frisco kid 1979 to name a few although in this film the villainous role seems laughable this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning and the long silly motorcycle race i give this film 1 10 i would have liked to see this film on mystery science theatre it would have been hilarious
<START> this movie is a desperate attempt to ride the of the success of the star wars movies the film uses recycled footage from battle beyond the sars which is another roger corman sci fi turd but atleast this one is better than battle beyond the stars there is no real acting in this film but its a roger corman film what did you expect again the entire soundtrack was done on a keyboard the sound effects are recycled from battlestar galactica there are no special effects because they were recycled rearranged space scenes from another movie the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance and he'd resurface again to star in the sylvester stallone movie over the top i give this movie 3 stars out of 10
<START> i'm a 55 year old fairly jaded gay white man since i don't watch tv i watch at least 250 films a year most on dvd i keep notes on all the films i see and rate them since december 2003 i have seen only five films as great as eighteen so i've rated eighteen better than at least 700 other recent films mr bell is far too modest in his film commentary eighteen is a great film and it also resulted in two firsts for me br br i watched the film the first time and i was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour something that's only happened to me three times before five minutes into the film i knew it was going to be very good when jason began reciting whitman i lost it and then the kiss well that is one of film's great kisses and that scene among filmdom's most poignant and unforgettable when pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled i clapped i cheered i love happy endings i wept br br then i watched the trailer and the previews and thought okay is this 800 000 or so indie really that great so i immediately watched eighteen again something that's only happened three times before and eighteen blew my socks off yet again even more so then i watched the making of eighteen documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and mr bell br br so i thought i'd watch eighteen again with the director's commentary i have never before watched a film three times in one night after the third time at 3 00 am i knew i had just experienced a great film eighteen now ranks 10 on my top twenty films of all time and in the very small universe of great gay or gay subtext film there is brokeback mountain eighteen mulholland drive and maurice br br thank you mr bell eighteen is brilliant and fully realized with a magnificent cast a wonderfully moving understated score excellent cinematography an entertaining touching totally appropriate and hummable song i can go on but i won't gush too much more br br this film should have received oscar nominations certainly one for best picture the performances without exception were all wonderful ms lovely sultry voice was a surprising epiphany and sir ian mckellen said awesome br br eighteen is the reason i slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films some in the 150 million plus range a year to find that one treasure that one exquisite magical unique and enchanting perfect egg enfolding an unforgettable heart br br finally i promise my second first i've never before posted a commentary on any film i've seen br br thank you again mr richard bell breathtaking genius give this man 100 million for his next film he made 700 000 us into one of the top 50 films of all time if i had the cash i'd grant him 75 000 a year living expenses and match any funds raised for his next film mr bell is already a great director at 31 years old can you imagine him at 45 years old br br wise and witty tender and brutal poised poignant understated yet edgy chilling and thrilling mesmerizing haunting unforgettable eighteen the masterpiece
<START> who are the people that star in this thing never heard of them but this is one of the funniest comedies i have run across it should win the putz prize for parody the absurd starts with dr snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend he is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie pay attention to the hospital pa system in the background rather like the system in mash the final scene with hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years oh and the busty nurse is cassandra peterson who went on to become elvira mistress of the dark br br if you liked the mel brooks classic movies blazing saddles etc i suspect you'd like this one br br damn shame you can't get it on dvd anywhere br br it's available on dvd now good thing dvds don't wear out from use
<START> paul naschy as a ghostly security guard in this is scarier than most of his fur and shoe polish werewolf guises the story is not unfamiliar a bunch of kids going to party at an abandoned school the thing is that one of these kid's fathers did the same thing years ago but he's now deceased and the latest group of kids seem to be reliving an event from 23 years ago this is fairly well done for films of this type and there's an air of mystery to what's going on because apparently what happened to the kids before is somewhat of a mystery and perhaps the truth wasn't revealed so no not just your standard slice and dice this moves along at a fairly good clip and doesn't let you lose interest like a lot of films do and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested too and there's some suspense which is lacking in a lot of films these days the ending is rather abrupt and i suppose is left mostly to your imagination but then again it doesn't out stay its welcome either 7 out of 10 check it out
<START> as someone has already mentioned on this board it's very difficult to make a fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial ' a plausible premise a narrative ' and really believable acting aka great acting br br such is not the case with 'love machine' it starts to show its faux hand about the 20 minute mark with 60 minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in it's downhill from there br br director gordon simply peaked too soon but to be fair to his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a real doc couldn't get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his film br br the premise people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website was perhaps more interesting in 1997 98 when the film was made does a lot of tricky stuff a pushy ' hand held cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites all i guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesn't work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue
<START> it kept me on the edge of my seat true the story has a few plot holes but the sheer tension of it the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinating br br josÃ© and adriana are two of spain's best actors see la vida mancha and hÃ©ctor and here they appear as a happy upper middle class couple beneath it all the truth is that all of life is a lie he's not an economist never went to college or does not work in spain's central bank reserve as everybody else believes we get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable br br the inner workings of the scam are shown intermittently but it is credible because is a source of self assurance and assertiveness he not only believes in the scam he also believes in the film premise and therefore he carries it br br sure it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage's finances for almost 10 years but again since he's supposedly a brilliant economist br br it has been said in a nationalistic tone that the movie is not distinctively spanish as if that were a litmus test for good film true no or odd in this one just a taut thriller you'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching
<START> this movie appears to have been overlooked by everyone someone should bring it out on vhs and dvd it is an excellent film and far superior to the one with brooke shields which was terrible br br jean simmons deserves more credit than she is getting now days it would be nice if all her films were offered on vhs or dvd jean simmons was and still is a very good actress she certainly was a beauty in fact she is still a beauty she also has done extremely well on t v she is so much better than many of the actors today
<START> after a long wait bedrooms and hallways made it to perth cinemas not a commercial one mind you and i thought it was fun honest and took a swipe at those scream' groups running around trying to find meaning in rocks and 'what's behind my eyes' it is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story has terrific acting and says something about the human condition
