<START> opposing force 1986 wasn't as good as dr strangelove and it wasn't as good as the bridge on the river kwai heck it wasn't even as good as g i jane which is pretty sad br br the film revolves around a basic ethical problem in a simulated prisoner of war situation how far can you go before you start breaking the law what exactly is the law in such a situation how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone can you intentionally inflict pain how about breaking bones mock executions sexual abuse severe blood loss real guns with bullets death somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing acceptable from atrocious br br now what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish what could you do this movie attempts to portray this dilemma br br i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training i have a brother who went through the pow training program according to him it was pretty close to the mark technically br br the film has a fairly good premise but it doesn't have a particularly good story i wondered if it might be based on some actual event but it became pretty apparent that it wasn't when the explosions started they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shoot em up with lots of distracting explosions br br i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending again kind of pointless i'm left wondering what the point of the whole thing was i'm beginning to suspect there simply wasn't one it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks
<START> this movie was dreadful biblically very inaccurate moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of egypt the movie has him about forty moses was about forty when he fled egypt was gone for forty years and was with them wandering for forty years moses was 120 years old when he died and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land i realize movies use a lot of poetic license as the biblical account isn't that long but if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character this movie fails in this aspect and in many others even though the 1956 version has its problems as well theatrically it was much better
<START> hilarious show with so many great stories that it reflects the world today as we know it in such a funny way it literally stole my laughters for other shows i laughed so hard that i just found any other comedy shows unfunny the unique confessions of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous you may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family that's what i thought at first but i found out that it holds new and unique techniques that completely sets it apart from any other average comedy show michael rapaport is a star i sure wish that this show wasn't canceled
<START> it's dreadful rubbish i liked 'how do you want me' 'father ted' 'green wing' and bill bailey's standup act but i file this with 'hippies' and of the apes' the re imagining under 'great pedigree went badly wrong' my guess is that it appeals to the same people who like and i' it's overwritten but to little end a ish air pervades it and bernard black is simply a less camp withnail and i thought it was self indulgent even before dylan moran became the writer but the set up such comic potential that for the first 2 i didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit chortle worthy br br the things they are saying doing should be funny but somehow they don't manage to register as more than mildly amusing or i can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny what i am trying to say is that the situations remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane gentle self consciously surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom br br life is too short avoid
<START> i can't disagree with a previous comment that driving lessons is more than a little twee but one man's indictment is another's endorsement i suppose in my book this film succeeds on pure charm no small feat in itself br br i can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway julie dame is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress though hasn't had steady work in years it's unclear the last time she visited reality if ever think edina from at 65 at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitsch factor some may find her annoying but i think that's the point to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved ben's rupert buttons to force him out of his shell ben is equally isolated from reality living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother who laura linney manages to breath some life into despite being a fairly one dimensional character ye olde overbearing religious mom i was rather impressed with rupert who i found to give a very honest and believable performance not to mention sweet as all get out i can't think of many teen actors today for whom i can say that br br the heart of the movie is what happens when ben and worlds collide at first ben is understandably tentative but also intrigued as is essentially the exact opposite of everything he's ever known with the combination of persistence and ben's helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives ben his first real taste of independence br br the tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance a credit to the main actors all in all i'd say that if you're willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances driving lessons shouldn't disappoint however if cute is not in your movie vocabulary best to stay away br br one other minor note the soundtrack features the music of stevens prominently a nice touch
<START> i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film i had just seen the moog doc which was alright the only problem was moog led a very content life and the doc was well content haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days but it carries a great deal of heart with it though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie invention of the where bruce could actually play music by touching people it must have been challenging to document haack's output which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit and the cast what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a telepathic guru tripping with kids fighting against the music industry i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history it's that mainstream but that important
<START> happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974 but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of american br br there were some similarities between american and happy days br br both opened with rock around the clock by bill haley the both took place in a bygone era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles but there were also some major differences while american took place in 1962 california and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood happy days took place in and centered around a group of teenagers in high school dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence br br happy days originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of bill haley the rock around the clock but when oldies became hot thanks to the success of american and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock entered the billboard hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974 royalty payments went through the roof so a remake of the song the correct term is now new stereo recording was quickly substituted br br the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right br br fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist liberties were taken and details overlooked making this show less than completely authentic br br this is perfectly fine happy days is supposed to be a comedy not a history lesson but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics one episode centered around the cunninghams building of a fall out shelter another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life the issue of the draft even came up on a later episode br br the show as originally set in 1955 one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast most of them were teenagers and as each year passed it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast moving the series out of the safe waters of the eisenhower years into the age of camelot all the way with jfk and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s that along with the writers running out of ideas and later cast members like ron howard leaving the series wisely quitting while they were ahead left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead that along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn't control themselves every time the great fonzie entered the scene began to wear very thin very fast br br this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era time heals wounds you know everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the original hit versions over those new stereo recordings those new stereo recordings worked very well on happy days and this is where i find myself regretting my buying the dvd unlike the complete first season dvd the original music on the complete second season has been replaced with different music while it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch
<START> the only good thing that this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice cream minus the dead body parts in it the movie is one of the most cheesy i've seen in a long time when the ice cream king dies in the beginning i was laughing so hard because the kid took the ice cream from him and started eating it his mom asked him to say something and should should have said leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so i can watch my acting career go down the drain at a young age that seems about right for a line then i wondered why the ice cream prince was behind the bars of his ice cream truck was someone going to rob him of his twenty cents i've never seen bars on a ice cream truck window it seemed pretty stupid you might as well forget about the acting because it is just awful forget about this movie and go down to dairy queen and get an ice cream
<START> this movie is very bad in fact the only reason why i've given it a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh without giving anything away a man's head actually explodes in this film it was so pathetic i laughed i don't believe the scene was meant to be funny but it's nonsense complete nonsense the original halloween is such a good film it's a shame they had to go and make such a stinker
<START> if this movie was made two years earlier it could have been a lot better but unfortunately it was made in the decade that had no idea about how a horror movie was supposed to look or act when i first heard about this movie people on imdb were it as the sequel to cheerleader camp oh how wrong they were yes betsy russell was in it but uma thurman sure wasn't i'd really like to find the person who started that whole sequel rumor i'm sure a lot of us would though i'm not gonna give anything away because frankly i don't remember how this movie even ends i'm just gonna tell you to watch a real camp horror movie the burning starring jason alexander fisher stevens holly hunter the geek from fast times at ridgemont high a word to the wise just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title doesn't mean its gonna be worth watching oh and another thing any horror flick made in the early to mid 90's was ever considered even remotely good
<START> i guess i wasn't sure to what to expect from this film it had a good cast an interesting story line and a bunch of other things going for it but i still couldn't shake a feeling of dread that i had in my stomach about what it would be like i am glad to say that i was very pleased with the result and regret worrying about it all along the films opening scenes were extremely intriguing and were enough to sustain early interest in the film as the film progressed we were introduced to the characters of the film as well as what happened in the prison riots like most reviews for this film i have to admit that there is some cliches but it can't erase the overall power of this film that reads like a good novel the cast are all great particularly chestnut and and the film ranks as one of the better made for tv films of this year certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good courtroom drama
<START> this film was a surprise the plot synopsis sounds kinky and stars clint eastwood and the great geraldine page i didn't know what to expect there is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering and very adult mouth to mouth kiss the child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives he takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the headmistress played by page her assistant and another student jealousy sexual tension incest intrigue and the macabre all meld in this wonderfully original story br br i've read the other comments here and find little to disagree with however i wanted to clarify a point made earlier that there are no sympathetic characters in the film i find that there is one the attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it touches upon the common history of black women slaves taken advantage of by white men even though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience she is what i would consider a sympathetic character she more than any of the other women and girls at the school has a legitimate reason for participating in what happens in the end
<START> i don't even know where to begin br br it's is not worth typing a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree thoroughly but i give it 1 10 instead of 2 10 i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial precept was promising but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful let's run through the main points plot good initial idea but truly terrible development there were many points when i thought no nobody would do something that stupid the ending was amazingly anticlimactic characterisation all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures i keep trying to think of one that wasn't possibly the mother but that's it music intrusive inappropriate and generally terrible direction totally amateurish cinematography doubt they've heard of it camera angles stability zoom levels often really bad i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years if not ever
<START> this film is good but not schaffner s best my favourite is papillon and patton but this is a sad and very nice film kris is good in this movie and really makes a difference i am going to miss schaffner and this is his last film br br a good film by a great director 7 5 10
<START> looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer or in this case director geoffrey reeve br br and it's a doozy laughable on just about every level br br some government agents i think are professionally murdered in amsterdam and a considerably less than charismatic block of wood interpol agent who i assure you is not named louis is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax dodge financiers get their money's worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location br br the wannabe hard hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what's happening regularly in horribly contrived were you followed oh no of course not no one outside washington even knows you're here yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing by the time a sinister vladimir putin lookalike priest no less than from from russia with love up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero pinned to the ground during a fight struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol and him shouting you at his friend's murdered corpse and the leather bound go go boys the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence all of which provide ample laughs only the climactic boat chase impresses it's an exciting well directed sequence that really has no place in this movie such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll reeve had nothing to do with that sequence thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous spit out your drink twist and warehouse shootout br br unless such a wretched thing as a geoffrey reeve completist exists and you're one of them i wouldn't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense
