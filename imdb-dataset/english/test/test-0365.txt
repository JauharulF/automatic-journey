<START> i really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife i suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me br br but putting that aside i found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead vincent spano br br i have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies i missed during that decade it has been my pet peeve that eighties nostalgia buffs seem to focus on the same core canon of films usually featuring the brat pack actors and actresses and neglecting the other films like creator that have fallen through the cracks but in the case of this feature i have to say i can understand it not all of these eighties films were magical and creator is proof of this
<START> so first things first br br angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da vinci code br br following the recent slew of comic book movies remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques lens flare excessive gci and over the top action sequences br br in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashioned it offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome beautifully shot by the way and the temple of modern science that is large facility br br hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in da vinci good support is offered by a rock solid cast with a particular highlight being armin mueller stahl's stoic cardinal but the films main saving grace is it's pace for the entire running time i was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic br br my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity but that is not the fault of the film makers rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story br br speaking of which the story is a cracker mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way br br overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe and fans of ripping adventure tales in general
<START> paul thomas anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows eddie adams aka dirk diggler mark wahlberg through six years of sex drugs and disco his chance meeting with pornography director jack horner burt reynolds starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time character is based on real life porn actor john holmes who like dirk was renowned for being extremely well endowed this is where dirk finds initial success br br the main themes in boogie nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre pornography drugs sex betrayal violence and music boogie nights deals with the pornography theme with some control it is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal but mentally explicit when they take place on screen br br throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously and the film's setting los angeles 1977 1983 reflects the popularity of the drug at that time which the film captures perfectly however boogie nights does not promote cocaine as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses for example at jack's party they find a girl who has recently and graphically overdosed blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit the film before this scenes has been fairly upbeat and comic but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur br br the music scenes are executed brilliantly from superbly staged disco scenes to a down and out dirk singing terribly in his new music career the soundtrack too is excellent featuring tunes from the emotions the beach boys and the unforgettable sound experience the standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music dirk redd john c reilly and todd parker thomas jane visit drug dealer rahad jackson's alfred molina house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs but night sister christian which is playing in the background increases the intensity of the scene incredibly proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene boogie nights is filled with those kind of scenes which makes the film even more fantastic br br the standout performance in boogie nights is burt reynolds as the enigmatic yet moody film director in the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies it is a complete shock for the audience because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content other notable performances are julianne moore heather graham as the beautiful john c reilly and mark wahlberg who delivers the performance of his career br br boogie nights is also a surprisingly original film using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong or at least until the 80s arrive from then on things turn very dark indeed and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone this does not however reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers br br boogie nights was not a box office success earning only Â£2 million at cinemas in the uk but this is not the film's or the director's concern anderson recognises quality not popularity which is evident in his three other films hard eight magnolia and punch drunk love i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations because at the end of this film you will realize that boogie nights is a simple morality tale but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it boogie nights is at once shocking hilarious devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding
<START> i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that the first one i saw bloodrayne was not a complete loss i liked it more than most people and actually rated it a 4 out of 10 next up was the first house of the dead movie now that was horrifically bad i could stand watching ten minutes of it and fast forwarding a bit and that was it i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10 br br but i had access to the sequel too which however is not by uwe boll but mysteriously written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original i thought i'd give it a chance and i actually managed to watch all of it it started out with some funny references and cool lines like how the president got his orders from the vice president and acting wise it is light years better than the first here we have cool like the ultra hot emmanuelle vaugier whose coolness is in league with carrie anne moss claudia black and evangeline lilly man i hope some matrix style movie comes along for her sometime and the always delectable super victoria pratt i love athletic women and there was also nadine velazquez catalina on my name is earl who performed quite well br br the story wasn't much and the action wasn't great either and the ending was a disappointment as they didn't succeed in their mission oh well at least the two mains survived guess that's some small victory too br br good cast but a pretty bad movie the actors make it watchable but there's no real substance there br br 3 out of 10
<START> after completing the lackluster novel heart of darkness i moved on to watch the movie which was a complete and absolute disappointment at the onset i expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book however even though i had read the novel the movie still made no sense at all so i can't imagine how lost i would be if i had skipped the book altogether it seemed as though the writers picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie and left out anything that may assist the viewers in comprehending the meaningless plot this dreadful movie made no sense at all and i would strongly recommend against watching it as it will do nothing more than leave you completely baffled and bewildered
<START> sheba baby is another pam grier blaxploitation film it was one of pam's less visceral films of this genre pam plays sheba shane who's a chicago gumshoe sheba's father is the owner of a small loan company in missouri when local mobsters try to run her father of of business sheba goes after the bad guys br br pam grier had already made her mark in blaxploitation films by the time sheba baby came along fans of both coffy and foxy brown know that pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress in sheba baby the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from pam wasn't as evident in this film not that pam doesn't kick butt in sheba baby she's just not as much of a runaway train vigilante as she was in her previous blaxploitation films br br the supporting cast in this film are a distinct disappointment so sheba baby is pam's film through and through and though pam's a bit more subdued than in her other films she still gives a compelling performance in sheba baby this film is definitely worth your time if you're an ardent pam grier fan
<START> pick a stereotype any stereotype whether racial sexual cultural etc and i bet you'll find it in wassup rockers do you think that all hispanic teenage boys are stupid hairy inarticulate and dirty troublemakers are hispanic girls sex crazed easy ass baring sluts do black people all want to start fights and carry guns do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them are all white teenage girls rich stuck up princesses who are bored with white teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous if you answered yes to any of the previous questions you my friend are a bigot and you will love wassup rockers br br director larry clark likes to shock his audiences i was 15 years old the first time i saw kids and i think that's why i'm still a virgin but wassup rockers isn't it's just bad he tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body hair close ups but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic br br simply put wassup rockers is a teenage boy's fantasy what 14 year old boy doesn't want to be a skater who gets in trouble crashes parties drinks 40s and is told by the hot rich white girl that his penis looks dangerous besides that demographic i really don't know who's going to enjoy this film

<START> i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen it's one of the main reasons why i stick to dvd's or videos i saw the clearing on dvd but if i had seen it in the movies i would have had to stand up and scream he's not dead yet you moron br br the clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature mr redford legal eagles havana indecent proposal up close and personal sneakers last castle and spy game if robert redford told me to invest in something i'd go the other way br br but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun he's holding it on you for most of the movie you turn the tables on him and start strangling him whatever you do keep strangling him until he's dead don't just strangle him for ten seconds stay with it ten minutes at least but bob stops too soon walks away and forgets about mr kidnapper until he gets up finds the gun and holds it on our hero again at this point i wanted mr kidnapper to shoot robert redford more than a few times and i wanted to shoot him as well

<START> blame guy ritchie the late 90s success of ritchie's clichÃ© ridden lock stock and two smoking barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered sadly rise of the the true story of essex hardnut carlton leach isn't likely to reverse that trend despite a decent lead performance from hartnett the film falls victim to all too familiar east end stereotypes they're either busy blowing someone's brains out or shagging a scantily clad blonde br br from fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties charts rise through the ranks of thuggery leaving the for nightclubs leach becomes a bouncer where he's given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders pat tate fairbrass and tony tucker stone and begins to realise gang warfare ain't what it's cracked up to be br br there is fun to be had deconstructing writer director julian laughable join the dots patois as every sentence seems to start with an 'i'm gonna or 'you or on occasion 'so then i only went an' typically concluded with a mandatory ' the direction too smacks of sadism especially the obvious glee gets from filming violent scenes in close up and in the case of the bloody shotgun to the face denouement in br br director use of the classic rise and fall gangster narrative isn't what will condemn to big screen obscurity nor is it the fact that half way through the film annoyingly sidelines leach in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of tate and tucker it's sickening appetite for scatter shot violence that ruins the film whether it's a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train it's all unnecessarily prolonged doesn't so much pack a punch as leave you feeling violated and more importantly robs you of two hours of your life you won't get back
<START> i am an australian currently living in japan i saw this movie on tv here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of western and japanese ideologies colliding whoever wrote the screenplay and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in japan the only part i thought was too hollywood y was when tom character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him public displays of affection are not really acceptable here finally a movie that highlights the true experience 9 10
<START> i had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory non stop action great movie br br these people were obviously watching a different movie honestly sucked from the word go i kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but i can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this i mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny i guess the best way to sum this up is it probably should've been rated pg by 1984 standards and now in the year 2010 there is no doubt this would be pg bad bad not in the fun cheesy b variety movie
<START> i should start off by saying i have something of a love hate relationship with musicals some of them are fantastic some are downright crap so i expected hair to fall into one of those categories however it didn't falling instead in the middle br br the songs aren't brilliant though the sodomy song did make me smile a lot and everything is rather dated looking but the movie didn't draw me in as others have such as rocky horror although that's a bad example since for years i hated rocky horror then all of a sudden i got it and have loved it ever since maybe hair will be the same although i doubt it will get as much exposure as rocky horror due to the language and nudity content so i doubt i will get the chance to have it grow on me hair grow oh suit yourself br br anyhow i didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch which was a shame since i would have liked to see how it ended especially after reading some of the reviews here br br not a film for the casual cinema goer but definitely one for musical lovers i really hope they don't re make it though since i think any such re make would end up a shallow pale pc version of the original br br worth a look for lovers of the genre
<START> a fairly interesting look at some characters from india's burgeoning middle class although india is rapidly modernizing her culture is not keeping up this film involves the patriarchal society where women are not yet truly free citizens a land of arranged marriages men who dally with mistresses with total impunity and women who are expected to tolerate all this will eventually come up short i was impressed with nandita das who was quite attractive and played her character with total earnestness but i was even more impressed with shabana azmi who i understand is a long time fixture of bollywood her quiet beauty and low key psychic suffering was excellent the lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic and never titillating darn worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures
