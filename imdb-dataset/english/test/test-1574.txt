<START> in these days of ultra fast and the internet coming up with a movie like the matrix may seem merely the next step from the term but do you remember what computers were like in 1974 right to come up with the notion of virtual reality back then is truly an amazing feat of the imagination fassbinder's movie of course has none of the massive gunslinging and pyrotechnics and a lot of 'artsy' elements instead but the atmosphere it creates is intense and poses the question how we can know what is real in a dark and gripping manner making this a chiller and a thriller for the mind it also takes it up a notch on more recent vr stories if you get out of one cyberspace can you be sure you didn't just emerge into another level of virtual reality
<START> if you take the movie for what it is worth you won't be disappointed if you think murray is supposed to win an oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting don't bother it was funny when i saw it in 1979 and hasn't lost its charm good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks the story line is simple and easy to follow murray has done better but this is his first film the movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect the other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer one nice thing about this movie it has a message
<START> alexander lou star of classics such as 'the super and vs headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest br br the plot involves the evil abbott white who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the shaolin temple br br this goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members although needless to say one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant abbott br br ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like tang vs aka 'the ninja hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot of course not it's the fights that matter in these films and by gum you get your moneys worth here there's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason br br if your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see
<START> this movie is highly improbable read the other reviews to see why br br i would say that most of the characters were plastic but they didn't even afford themselves that little luxury they just act like cardboard cutouts of course they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles so that's a crap shoot whether they can act at least didn't give a crap and just went with it but lance fuhgeddaboutit br br the one character who rang true was portrayed by gerry lopez who didn't really act he was himself pretty much he's quite accustomed to stomping people the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because i was laying out a newsletter on my laptop when it came on some cable channel late one night that saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster no way i would go out of my way to watch it
<START> after my daughter was born in 1983 i needed to lose weight i tried the 20 minute workout and i was hooked i lost about 50 lbs it was the most weight i ever lost in my life i can't believe this show is forgotten it would be a blessing if you started a cable channel strictly for exercise and included the 20 minute workout i think this was the best workout video ever made i wish i could purchase it somehow and somewhere the routine was easy to learn and you did work up quite a sweat the workouts they have today are too complicated and too hard to learn please do your best to get this video back in circulation i pray it will be a blessing to all who see and use it
<START> watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching star trek for the first time br br this series has it all the kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the tv to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair in awe and endless admiration br br in short we start out with john an astronaut who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black ironically known as peacekeepers br br other colorful characters consists of big dude with a short temper and a sword laser rifle sun former and a ph d in who's a plant no really she is she's also a priest but with a mean streak there's also xvi an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good br br later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television namely a young and seemingly chronically horny she is played by gigi which is a name you should remember br br one of the many things i love about these series is that since john ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake he keeps giving references to real life namely when john is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years one of his many complaint is that when he returns buffy the vampire slayer will be dead br br so all the other series get your dren together and spend an ahn on one of these episodes i can assure you sci fi as you know it will change forever br br this series has it all it's sexy it's actionpacked it's hillarious it's farscape
<START> the extraordinarily adorable suzy plays a statuesque performer obsessed with succeeding in the theater her husband and played by bernard blier is a composed but jealous man when he finds out in a less than preferable way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman with the intention of advancing her career he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder now at that point i must stop describing the film to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists revelations ambiguities and suspense that to imply any of it would endanger it i am not sure how good or bad that is for this french police procedural emanating from the song and dance community though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it we just don't know who did br br the story depends upon the procedure of following clues where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created fabrications and deceptions disintegrate interestingly this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon br br quay of the is the least dark of henri georges clouzot's films it's nowhere near as sinister as the shocking les diaboliques as tragic as the riveting wages of fear or as eery as le maybe it is due to the of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s france which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller br br clouzot both understands and approves of his characters even the more rotten ones where he has more of a vindictive streak with his other films where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in les diabolique or the truck drivers who sink to the level of risking horrible death in order to oust themselves from miserable life in the wages of fear there isn't necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker for these are characters who plainly made the direct decisions that determine their fate all the characters in this more settling film have scenes and moments that endear us to them even the harsh cold detective played by louis jouvet who worries about his young adoptive son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat br br there is humor and unabashed sexiness the latter mostly on the part of that neutralize the pressure to a degree clouzot was quietly practicing his craft patient till he made his unrelenting later films in which he would permit his audiences no pardon from the tension
<START> a lowly soldier in world war one rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of he creates an aggressive antisemitic war machine and a little toothbrush moustache sound like anyone you know br br from the safety of hollywood chaplin uses this soapbox to europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini given that the united states in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it and no strong desire to itself in europe's civil strife remember it was hitler who declared war on the usa not the other way round it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic br br the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly humane brave etc etc chaplin is and he also plays the jewish barber the little hero of the ghetto the tramp in all but name needless to say chaplin writes directs stars composes the music and does the catering br br in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third reich and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong a comedian and a chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making silly and hapless all this does is to humanise him when the not very warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside down aeroplane he becomes endearing rather than despicable as dictator he inspects his technical innovations which don't work the parachute hat the bulletproof uniform etc and these passages are meant to make us think that the real life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside in fact regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling br br in truth chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill considered polemic at heart he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen check out the humour with gags like staggering up and down the street semi conscious or the pantomime of the coins in the the hero schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of european decency against which can be judged but schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a nazi is it in any way believable that a schultz figure if such had existed would say to the face your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people and how does schultz come to be in the of the jewish ghetto if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz or but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age as usual chaplin thinks in terms of comedy set pieces loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers shaving a man to the accompaniment of and the globe ballet watch for the segment filmed in reverse br br goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice and the jewish haven in is ridiculously idyllic so hannah is quite literally too good to be true brave defiant resourceful hardworking and of course beautiful she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage gee ain't i cute she asks after the barber gives her a make over too cute by far is the answer she doesn't come close to ringing true because chaplin has made her a caricature the 'wouldn't it be wonderful ' speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author too wordy too emotionally cloying br br jack oakie is great as the fascist dictator of bacteria he brings a whiff of much needed comic brio to the proceedings but the film's underlying weakness remains if is silly and ineffective how can we fear him and anyway the stuttering stop start of the back projected train is a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth br br and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate uniform
<START> the bevy of box office big league stars is phenomenal in this movie william baldwin kiefer sutherland kevin bacon and julia roberts this movie was made in one of my favorite years too 1990 i am a and the setting in chicago was very identifiable and artistically as well i liked this movie and the agitation which motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element to the plot which was utterly sensational br br centers around a group of disgruntled pre med students who want to be flat lined as a way of attaining some sort of societal vindication when life does not make sense it would appear very illogical to get curious about apocalyptic nightmares at the same time once their desultory curiosity has gotten the better of them there is no turning back the king of the hill so to speak is the one who vehemently shouts i will do two minutes who else is going to do that anyone want to try for two and a half ultimately all of these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these re pro lives the consummation to their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360 degree perspective on the issues they were agonizing over whatever purpose all of this reckless and academic chicanery serves it is definitely an original approach for asserting your personality i liked this movie 1990 was a good year for me too things seemed to fall into place that year when i saw this movie some night in november during the year 1990 i was very glad that i did
<START> it seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say go go go the word is macha like mach pronounced maa ka br br i grew up with this series in the early 70's here in la on the late and very lamented channel 56 before that there was astro boy dating from 1963 on ol' tv astro boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when by then it'd become a series of badly animated talking heads a phenomenon which has only gotten worse 'nuff said br br as for speed racer i really enjoyed the basics there the pov shots the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then graphics graphics graphics take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley kramer's film grand prix 1966 especially the redone american credits br br oh yeah i have the original comics from which the series is based so i know of which i speak br br what were we doing animation wise besides crap like johnny quest same ol' stuff we'd been doin' since the 20's ho hum br br i guess the real problem i had have with the way anime was is shown on american tv is the hatchet job done on the scripts credits etc to sanitize them for american audiences i won't go into other programs as we're talking' speed here br br look at clowns like peter fernandez as one of the culprits here as he was 99 responsible for the re writes of the series not to mention the voice of speed racer x and others between him and the goofs at trans lux think felix the cat and the mighty hercules oy vey they took a slick very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of sesame street think cruncher bloch the company skull if i go on i'll puke br br this series dates from 40 odd years ago but i at the time was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other japanese programs i mean it's obvious when someone's getting' killed but they either remove it or gloss it over br br good show originally sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that crappy made in korea look not to mention being nauseatingly pc in content even the japanese outsource their animation now br br try the original japanese opening on youtube sometime it sends chills up my spine if only oh well robert
<START> spoilers the original road house is one of those movies that i know is clichÃ©d and unoriginal yet it's done so well i'm embarrassed to admit i really like it turns out many of my friends whose movie opinions i respect think the same way so when they attempt to make a sequel to it and it's as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel it's just bad really really bad br br oddly johnathon schaech is listed as one of the writers and i can only hope his wga membership is revoked the writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium schaech already appearing to be the king of the straight to dvd sequel 8mm 2 poison ivy 2 and now after seeing this and 8mm 2 i'm thinking his acting ability is non existent he was awful just awful br br and it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible but take it from me they're bad every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch yet still making the sound in the air that is then blocked by the opponent who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground this is repeated throughout the film worse than any bad 1970s cop show or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry kool aid for some reason and we're supposed to believe will patton is a fighting machine his fight scenes look so amazingly fake i was honestly embarrassed watching br br it's the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible for instance johnathon schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side she's on i'm with the feds but don't tell anyone the female villain who fights the good girl in one fight scene with acrobatics that rival any super hero yet is easily held down by the will patton old guy in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he utters some ridiculous line stab me once shame on you stab me twice ain't gonna happen whew that's bad and then head butts her jake busey's villain shoots at the feds while caught in the middle of a drug deal yet no dea agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after in fact he's simply let go because this is the sheriff's territory busey wants the bar because it's in a great location for drug deals yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the perks the bar is supposed to have johnathon schaech's character is supposed to be the son of patrick swayze's character in the original yet swayze's character's last name is dalton and schaech's isn't nor is the supposed brother of swayze's character and johnathon schaech looks about 50 in this movie i looked it up he's 17 years younger than swayze but he looks awful br br but my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down i'm thinking please don't tell me he's impaled on something and sure enough my worst fears were realized br br actually i could go on for another half hour about the things i hated about this movie suffice to say let's put an end to these ridiculous straight to dvd sequels to theatrical movies at least the ones with johnathon schaech
<START> rules of engagement is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it is well constructed superbly pieced together and provides excellent footage to back up the assertions that it takes on the movie's best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the as much as it enlightens the audience to the blatant governmental mistakes and lies that surrounded the entire situation i'm left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way that the government handled and then covered up a tragedy of this magnitude the cover up is what left me really fuming it is one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt but another to look the american people squarely in the eye and lie to them i guess it shouldn't surprise me with the history of our beloved country that has seen the jfk assassination the vietnam war and other significant events that smell so bad of a cover up that you have to hold your nose every time you drive through washington d c the footage from an airplane with special heat sensing technology and the autopsies on some of the bodies clearly show that the fbi is lying to the public one of the things that i try to stay aware of when watching a documentary such as this is that i am usually only receiving testimony from one point of view but again that is without a doubt one of the brilliant successes of rules of engagement it presents its evidence in such a concluding fashion that even if you were presented with statements from the fbi how could you really believe them i remember clearly when the standoff was taking place the way the media presented the as this crazed group of cult rebels with david the self professed reborn jesus christ as their leader none of this was truly factual but rather story spun from bits and pieces of facts they were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as american citizens if you were the and you wanted to search the compound is attacking the building with a unit of men who are armed with rifles and bullet proof suits the way to go about doing it if you are the fbi why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to help solve the situation why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire why lie about not firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video unless unless you wanted to see the situation end up the way it did the scene at the end when the star of david flag blew off the flagpole into the fire and the was shortly thereafter raised up was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach turn uncontrollably the filmmaker william deserves one my highest congratulations it takes a lot of guts to make a movie like this and i am sure there have been many repercussions from the government for it as well because of people like him the public can be shown real truth rather than crap that gets filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine when i think back to how i felt at the time toward the because of the media's representation of david and how i felt after seeing this movie it is truly amazing it reminds me of the line from the bible of a man who was healed by jesus and asked by the elders how it happened before i was blind but now i can see he kept telling them do yourself a favor and watch this movie you may have to look for it but it is truly something special
<START> 2005 will go down in 'dr who' history as its most incredible year everything seemed to click a first rate new doctor and companion big audiences 10 million for the first episode and christmas special major awards critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced but then christopher eccleston dropped a bombshell quitting after just one series it looked like the honeymoon was over luckily the public appears to have embraced his successor the excellent david tennant on top of this the show boasts fine s f x like the spaceship crashing into 'big ben' in of london' and superb story lines such as 'tooth of ghosts the new 'dr who' is basically the same as the old only updated for the 21st century some fans have accused russell t davies of 'ruining' the show they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along
<START> i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised the cast acted superbly but michael sheen was outstanding i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment he looks completely physically different in this role from any other role i have seen him in or as himself williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries as represented in this film the film is at times distressing to watch because of the emotional anguish displayed however it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly
<START> at first i didn't like they way the director was constantly switching from the past gulliver's travels to the present gulliver in the insane asylum but it really is the best way to film the story even though it took some getting used to danson is outstanding as the title character and edward fox makes a wonderful villain worst part is mary steenburgen as gulliver's wife she never has been hollywood gorgeous and in this film they make her look downright dowdy for some reason i'll never understand why directors make a woman ugly when it adds nothing to the story plus you want to strangle her for being so damn stupid in believing the lies bad guy bates keeps telling her even her son can see thru the bastard still a good show and i rate it b
