<START> is this supposed to be serious i hope not this is one of the most pathetically hilarious movies i've ever seen given that i picked it up for a buck on the bad movies shelf it sure lives up to its spot in the shop what can i say the gore effects are spattered pun intended all over the place some looking quite real some looking like a teddy bear that's had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce the music is some of the most horrible i've heard the acting is one of the most amusing elements must i continue don't bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop and this is all that's left
<START> this movie isn't that great at all but it's good when you want to just laugh because it's pretty ridiculous there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy i got this movie for christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year this is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts this movie is good for someone young although come to think of it i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion the movie was really predictable i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy i think it was appropriate for the whole family but dress was a bit but certainly appropriate enough for family material
<START> it's hard to use words for this movie since it contains none itself br br but the images it conveys both powerful and sweeping are ones which remind us why we watch movies and you might be saying well leonard maltin doesn't like it it can't be that good but you're wrong see this movie french cinematic brilliance en ensemble
<START> i really like kinski he is a great actor i've seen this movie because i've heard that there are autobiographic aspects in this movie br br the film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow pictures at the walls then the narrator always says abstract sentences like a kid sells fortune but her box is empty now this is really disturbing and wasn't really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is all about the movie shows how kinski's character treated woman and how he kept them under control if there are really some aspects of kinski's life in this story then he really was an swine so there is no need to watch this movie unless if you want to see kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about
<START> i'll make this brief this was a joy to watch it may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts but aside from this minor observation i found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable the visuals were most stunning except for the second rate cg scenes which could have been left out i dislike computer generated animation anyways it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one watch it you will appreciate it too
<START> ya know i have no idea how everybody else's teenage life was but this does not reflect the folks i knew and hung around with let alone myself and just in case if you're wondering no we weren't pristine clean cut pat boone type teens if there was ever such a thing br br look i'm not saying being a teenager is easy the better well actually the best teen movie of this time is fast times at ridgemont high now those kids i knew and were as realistic as it got back then and maybe now br br this was crap this was a low rent version of fast times and even then it didn't do much for me it had a few moments but not enough for me to recommend this or even claim this is how it was for teens back in 1982 i couldn't relate the lead girl girls did nothing for me and please if they really wanted to keep their virginity they would have in which case this film would not have been made pure crap and a bad staple to be left behind as a time capsule cinema for teens young adults in the early '80's
<START> this movie is sooooo bad that it forced me to create an account with imdb just to warn others about it br br i have been using imdb for a long time and many movies have come close to making me want to register to either praise or bash them however none have ever been that worthy until now br br i am a huge matt dillon fan all i could ask myself throughout this movie is how did dillon choose this script really i mean there are holes in it larger than br br i mean it is a modern day heist movie not one set in the seventies for crying out loud even a child knows that armored trucks have gps tracking and the sort makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in hollywood br br i could go on for ages but i wont believe me when i say this save yourself the time and give this a skip br br sorry matt i'm still a fan but this movie sucked
<START> everything about this movie is perfect the set design the acting the camera movement the mood the colors everything you'll be hard pressed to find a better movie easily the best film generated in the last 35 years keep an eye on michael
<START> this movie is a great movie however it is as most movie highly predictable the greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character amanda bynes who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious she is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the most strangest and gut busting faces ever made it's good for the kids and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end all in all they did a good job updating an old classic and deserves to rest on the movie stand along with o and 10 things i hate about you the other actors also do a swell job in many of their first time debuts
<START> i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this this my friends is one of the worst tv movies i've ever seen there is no excitement in this film br br the story starts out with drew summers candice cameron bure driving to a small town while in a trance she stays with a couple who coincidentally had a daughter named laura who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike thing is laura was killed over a year ago her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered making it look like he had killed her br br while settling in this town for a while drew starts to have visions and nightmares these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isn't the killer after all throughout the film you find out that ray sr denis is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her br br the movie is too long and very boring the film just drags on and on and on and on amazingly i saw another tv movie after this called cloned 1997 which was good but i'll review that one later br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 avoid this tv movie it is not worth your time this is the worst tv movie of 1997
<START> ex reporter jacob eric roberts is hired by an acquaintance raymond j barry to find his ex wife and son heads to palm springs and quickly locates the ex laine beverly d'angelo with someone he believes to be the son a young johnny depp but things turn out to be a bit more complicated as discovers former white trash laine has definitely married up in the form of millionaire simon fleischer dan hedaya and her first son is nowhere to be seen br br director writer matthew chapman is channeling body heat here and this mid 80s neo noir is watchable enough thanks to an all star cast and nice locations d'angelo was still looking good around this time so she makes for a good femme fatale and isn't afraid to show some skin however the mystery isn't very compelling in the end co starring dennis emily and henry gibson chapman made several thrillers in the 80s but his biggest career achievement was co authoring the screenplay for the infamous color of night
<START> there are lot of similarities between never say never again and thunderball not only on sean connery but also the story and plot except the actors all other are same like hijacking atomic bombs asking for ransom trafficking nukes in a ship etc only difference are place of occurrence in thunder ball plot it is in bahamas in never say never again it is over north africa and in thunder ball the nato raf itself loads the nukes into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an rouge arm of the axe and air dropped over us and stolen in caribbean almost 99 is same if anybody wants to dispute this they are most welcome
<START> i l o v e this movie everyone and their grandmother's sister's lawyer's dentist needs to own it its witty devilish thrilling comedic and full of action packed goodness with this movie those amazing people at troma offer you a whole new perspective into the story of romeo and juliet in ways you never would have thought to be possible it has all the makings of an instant classic car crashes deliciously lewd sex scenes feuding families street fights amazing music severed heads and from narrates the story line and thats only a taste of what it has to offer every single person i have watched this movie with now owns their own copy or longs to a and
<START> an absolutely baffling western featuring flash forward sequences set in an insane asylum south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the at cannon film co directed by william sachs who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren't worth discovering the cast most of whom never made another film try gamely but are hamstrung by the screenplay which generally makes no sense the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops ultimately it's a lot of talk and little else
<START> okay anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film a sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor joseph cotten whoring himself out for a buck mr cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead i know mr andrews was in the throes of alcoholism but why did cotten do this mess br br as for the plot it's a reworking of the frankenstein plot the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story then inexplicably they introduced a daughter this wasn't a bad thing until then out of the blue they decided to stop making a horror film but make a soft core pornographic flick the change was dramatic and bizarre it was almost as if they said okay mr cotten is done with his scenes and has gone home now ladies strip br br the problem is that on every level the film is just awful except for the monster's makeup while not great it is still pretty cool to see but bad writing acting and a budget of 17 46 conspired to make this a drab and awful flick one so bad that tossing in some nudity for the pervs out there shouldn't be enough to entice anyone to see it
