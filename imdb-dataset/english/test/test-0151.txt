<START> take a clichÃ© story and insert steve guttenberg need i say anymore this truly is as bad as you would expect sheriff tom palmer guttenberg and anna attempt to transform a group of useless inept kids into a winning soccer team lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film despite my reservations about acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than previously unimaginable i thought this type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'
<START> with all of mainland europe under his control hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for north america great britain with an overwhelming edge in aircraft luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper once in the air however the raf disrupts the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of sky air at a seven to one rate the battle of britain rages on for a over a year as the island nation is bloodied but unbowed providing crucial time for their american allies to produce more arms for the inevitable struggle br br using more staged footage than the three previous documentaries in the why we fight series the battle of britain has a more propaganda like feel to it with the dramatized some with unmistakable warners music score scenes glaringly obvious to newsreel in an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by german air attacks beethoven's seventh symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering the story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine it is the 20th century version of the 300 spartans br br there have been more exhaustively researched and better looking commercial efforts done on this battle since this film but the immediacy and motivation the battle of britain provided then will always make it a more valuable document of england during its finest hour
<START> this could have been great the voice overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a t one small problem though the look of the characters mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same the same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as or weight size it looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here if i am not mistaken kathy griffin did a voice over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny br br there is a few other problems one being the family plot the simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into here we get too much annoying diversions like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off as you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the simpsons or even more married with children br br if i should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness peter griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others lois should have been named lois lame because she is sort of one dimensional seth green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show br br so what more can i say there isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the simpsons has done for almost two decades
<START> i bought this video on a throw out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award winning brit sex comedy i guess i should have read the finer print i rarely write a panning review but here goes br br these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors the theatre going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations br br i repeat is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on screen personae with this trashy flick can the reference to the austen classics 'pride and and 'sense and sensibility' be anything else how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars are we meant to simply take it as a lay down that all actors are gay and thus letting their on screen affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces too i'm sorry but i don't think so i say no to this one
<START> i saw that this movie was coming out and could not wait to see it i have to say i was very disappointed with it this would have been better as a mini series the whole show seemed very rushed they did not explain things very clearly at the end they showed john paul ii alive and well and the next scene he was dead never any explanation as to what happened we all know what happened in real life i think abc dropped the ball big time on something that could have been great in all i think this movie was a blur it seemed like a drunken monkey jumping around from one point in john paul's life to another point never explaining how or why things happened such as when his older brother leaves it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home also when his father dies all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was that i was very disappointed with the over all movie
<START> although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best
<START> there is no denying it sci fi on tv is difficult there are so many problems that the genre brings with it like the need for a good budget solid writing decent acting perhaps the budget and the script writing is the departments where i feel most attempts have failed so does surface succeed not completely but more so than most br br the way i see it a good sci fi show doesn't really need a lot of cgi to work nor does it need a ton of money what it needs is the capacity to create a larger than life feeling the feeling that there is more than meets the eye something to make me curious and willing to try and figure out how it's going to end adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying aha is what makes or breaks a show like this one br br surface had a couple of flaws first of all it's basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been nor is the revealed story as exciting or daring as i hoped in the beginning also the tv feeling is very present much of the time all the way from the crappy cgi that ranges from decent to awful to the rather shifting quality in the acting department also it feels sometimes a bit too family oriented in that it takes the edge of sometimes and becomes almost cutesy but aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci fi shows out there but it manages to keep me interested the whole season and it offers a couple of nice cliffhangers between shows as well the ending for me is not that appealing i don't like shows that end without ending so to speak leaving the story unresolved it's especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season it is as of yet undecided br br hbo is to me the benchmark for quality television their series have the best actors the best production values and above all the most solid writing this is not hbo quality but it's good for what it is good enough to want another season without a doubt
<START> i first saw this movie in papua new guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since although i have never seen it since that first time br br just how easily good people's lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me forever br br the movie is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by anthony quinn is superb br br this movie should be in all college studies about man's inhumanity to man
<START> i can't believe this movie has an average rating of 7 0 it is a fiendishly bad movie and i saw it when it was fairly new and i was in the age group that is supposed to like it
<START> so far only the first episode has been shown and a great fuss has been made about the lesbian sex scenes but for those who bother to look past that they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that has in this episode ended in an upsetting climax cliffhanger i have found the story so powerful that i have been inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series has been based
<START> an introspective look at the relationship between hawking and the space time contingent this film the and laws and there relation to einstein's theory of general relativity br br the film is methodically directed exposing details of the man hawking as well as his work black holes interviews with his family are a little too long so sadly there is less development of his theories and ideas br br a philip glass soundtrack superbly compliments the film only one other man could compose such haunting melodies jean michel jarre br br overall i would highly recommend this movie on the basis of hawking's of and his adequate explanation of an event horizon
<START> 1 the largest amount of money spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach the ones that were supposed to be intestines 2 ken shamrock is in it 3 ken shamrock gets destroyed he doesn't die which is sad 4 it leaves you wanting more aspirin 5 the makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like just give him a 30 mask good enough for me 6 the scarecrow runs a chick over awesome 7 the film makers don't actually make their actors sing or play the guitar 8 the scarecrow uses a volleyball pole as a javelin and impales the dude who doesn't actually play the guitar or sing 9 the scarecrow can choke a dude in like 3 seconds 10 it makes you actually think of all these things and write them down for other people god what am i doing
<START> i saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on hbo and i loved it it was so hilarious i have seen it too many times to count i love the stork brothers and the pitiful ugly dog my favorite quote form the movie is it's so ugly it should be put to sleep i also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick that way i love john cusack and demi moore in this movie too they were great this movie brings back memories of my college days when i first saw it i rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over my college roommate and i just couldn't get enough of it who couldn't love this crazy movie i want to buy a copy on dvd does anyone know where i can get it
<START> i taped this as a teenager in the mid 80s based upon the synopsis in the cable guide the scavenger hunt aspect appealed to me having no knowledge or expectations of the film what a pleasant surprise when i viewed it this was such a fun film and i remember watching it repeatedly i thought that the concept was well executed i enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups and i thought that the scavenger hunt itself was quite clever sometimes it seems that people have far too great expectations for movies not all movies are going to have a weighty message or stellar acting production values or special effects sometimes movies are just meant to entertain and be fun and this one succeeds on both levels it was so nice to read the comments from the actors who played the twins i haven't seen this movie in years but if i did i think i'd have just as warm and enthusiastic a reaction to it as i did as a teenager even as i type this snippets of the cheesey yet appropriate theme song are running through my head when midnight madness starts to get to you it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do
<START> i really enjoyed candid camera with dom deluise and i was surprised to see that after the years suzanne somers have the co star of the show but that was the only positive side of the show the whole studio the intro the hosts all that give the new meaning to the word pompous br br well that would be ok if the materials weren't so cr ppy i mean come on the best you can do is show few men that have problem with getting ketchup out of the bottle suzanne somers walking with halloween basket in july ice cream place that sells only vanilla i've seen few episodes and each time it was horrible they were posing like it's the greatest show ever and then fill the time with scenes so dull that i really felt embarrassed to watch even the people in them looked bored and that just can't be good
