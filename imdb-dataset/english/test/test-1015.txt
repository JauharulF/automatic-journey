<START> some people thought this was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece i however am so tired of the state of the two party system in our country that i can't stomach propaganda from either side i was hoping for a horror show but got cute zombies and partisan bull crap i watch my horror films to be scared this didn't even attempt to be scary also this doesn't have the wit of romero in his political cultural satire laced in his movies this was a blatant no imagination story that was hard for me to stomach for the wrong reasons on the bright side if you hate bush you'll love this i'm not condoning hate or bush with this statement
<START> when i first saw this i thought it was a joke all i could think was you get the 8mm camera i'll get my little brother's monster toys we'll make a movie why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a sci fi movie like this it looks like it was made in the early 80's with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian a script that was written by the director's 4 year old son a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop poverty row special effects and to top it off a director that thought making this crap would make them famous the end result wasn't spectacular complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity from venus must have been fun to make and i'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie br br a 2 out of 10 for a valiant hopeless effort br br
<START> clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of argento but with other 70s low budget drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic the lack of money shows does anyone care too much the acting is adequate rather than professional does that make it more realistic but unlike so many other movies and not just low budget ones this does not drag for a moment crap it may be but non stop crap in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what i'm talking about at times quite delirious this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch
<START> after finishing the zero woman series i was looking forward to the female prisoner scorpion series both based upon comics by unfortunately i was not able to see them in order as this is the third in the series br br it starts great as the scorpion is escaping from the police detective did manage to get a cuff on her but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away if that isn't bad enough later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat br br scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside first a local yakuza v threatens to put her back if she doesn't put out and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of but they don't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance br br soon they are dropping like flies some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder the madam lee turns herself in to avoid getting killed br br the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer she's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend watanabe has been supplying her with food the story o yuki watanabe and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting but only incidental to the movie they try to burn her out but this is the scorpion and she has some unfinished business br br not the usual mix of sex and violence this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout
<START> just before dawn is an excellent horror movie it is atmospheric filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature in which few young people meet their doom in the shape of two crazed fat bastards who slaughter them jeff is very talented and intelligent director who is unfortunately underrated he achieved to built tension not with gore but with showing menacing nature environment succeeds to built a tension in a very linear simplistic way which is also the best way not to show to the viewer the gore but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters br br just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre deliverance and hills have eyes it is as good looking as deliverance better than hills i mean scarier and better crafted and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre br br is one of the best horrors of past few decades who finally lives on dvd
<START> what can be said about such a pathetic movie br br very bad acting the main actress seems to know only one facial expression fear mixed with weakness like a poor beaten dog the other actress the one who plays the evil looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne with an awful red wig the other actors are so pitiful that they don't even worth being described br br there's absolutely no plot the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere we don't know anything about the meaning of 11 11 nor who really is excepted the simple she's evil or she's a child of apocalypse which is not an explanation we don't know why the parents have been killed what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen as the film goes on we just watch pseudo scary scenes with a bad music moreover the end doesn't tell anything we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut there's no plot so no possible interpretation br br 11 11 is just full of clichÃ©s it is so obvious that i couldn't help laughing for example the deserted library or the bathroom scenes ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind there's even the fashionable little scary girl as in dark water or the ring of course the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl dark hair red lips skinny black clothes is it an obligation to make her credible i don't think so the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible nor endearing br br terrible direction as i said nothing original everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose br br there are some funny incoherences for example i don't know if ghost science paranormal course or whatever is taught in american universities in europe it is really not the case teachers talking about negative energies or using creatures sensors ridiculous also how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super 8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen and how can you on this old film isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face i wonder if the director has ever tried to an old analogical film br br eventually 11 11 just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch but it's an expensive way to fall asleep
<START> jennifer montgomery's art for teachers of children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14 year old jennifer's seduction of her married boarding school guidance counselor the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing jennifer caitlin grace mcdonnell and jennifer's mother actually voiced by ruth montgomery on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i've ever seen captured on film the lesson ultimately learned here there's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art well i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of art for anyone interested in thought provoking independent cinema
<START> for those who like their films full of exploding planets and extreme violence this is definitely not one to see in fact there is very little plot at all or at least very little that could not be summarised in a few seconds a meets b mr a falls for mrs b and has an affair with her a and b then fall in love and wonder at great length whether to have an affair themselves br br this is cantonese visconti story there is none but what you do get is a succession of wonderful images and poignantly trivial music which convey the slow passage of the central characters' emotions there is also the chance to see one of the world's most beautiful women in a succession of stunningly elegant outfits for my money it's worth seeing for that alone how could this woman ever have been an action heroine she looks as though she has stepped straight out of the pages of vogue
<START> having just seen this i find it hard to believe that it is not better known this and the slightly better known but almost as shamefully neglected come and see 1986 must be two of the greatest war films they are meaningful powerful incisive the ascent is also gifted with a sparingly used but brilliantly trenchant score by
<START> yawn that is my reaction to this film i was really hoping this would have been a good modern day slasher but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers instead it tries to be something it isn't which is a psychological thriller and it fails so miserably at this even the title freak suggests that this might be interesting match this with the cover art on the dvd and you think ok maybe i will give this one a try not worth the time br br the story actually starts up a bit interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head being chained up by his fat mother she yells at him and probably beats him since in one scene we see her actually slap him for no reason after all this he decides he has had enough and smashes her face in with i believe a rock present day he is now in insane asylum and is being transfered on his way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes introduce also the 2 leads characters a little girl and her older sister they are moving and hit the road so most of the movie is them riding around in the car talking amongst themselves but the bandaged freak is now on the loose and is about go on a rampage of grueling murder this is me being totally sarcastic br br i can't believe how boring this movie turned out to be the budget was on the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialog i could just care less about this is one of those movie where the packaging is better then the flick itself and to compare this to halloween rubbish i am not even a fan of the the halloween series except the 3rd one but halloween is far superior than this at least with halloween we have a great score and some genuinely creepy moments with this there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing creepy about this movie maybe this movie would have fared better if it had a solid score because even the worst of movies are tolerable if the music is good br br well that is just my opinion on the movie i thought it was just a complete waist of time and money but since the movie has over a 4 10 rating on imdb there must be people that like this movie i am not one of those people 2 10
<START> this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 hobos it's done really cheesily and big stupid running off one liners like a cardboard cassanova but jack elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid jesse now jerome my favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves you loved her danny big protege is surprisingly stupider but not as loathsome as our lead star there's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner joyce meadows is the sweet naive nice gal and probably the least annoying and those yellow oh and booze is evil according to mr stupid br br this movie's a hoot watch the mst cover of this and terrific elam homage
<START> please do not go see this i did have several laughs throughout this movie but they were all due to unintentional comedy br br there were only three characters in this movie so it was amazing how bad the character development was pacino played pacino again and was aggravating most of the time the scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor there is no continuity and i found myself wondering why i didn't leave 15 minutes into this br br i would suggest never seeing a movie directed by d j caruso this really was awful
<START> what a waste of time i got about five minutes into it and became very antsy and was soon fast forwarding a bit and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast forward button was nonexistent actors mark redfield and barry murphy did very capable jobs i thought but no one else i saw gave anything like a good performance again take this review with a large grain of salt because the movie was just so unbearable i couldn't make it to the end heck i couldn't make it to the middle br br i find myself unable to submit this review because it isn't long enough maybe this last sentence will put it over the top
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed carmen better than original sin angelina jolie antonio bandaras which share some thematic similarities and which i also enjoyed very much i felt the acting was stronger here paz vega displayed a wider range has more fire and was also great overall their acting was more gritty more believable less dreamy than original sin and both actors here had less 'celebrity and 'pretty face' to depend on to make the movie work vega definitely sizzles as to be expected br br director vincente has also built a detailed world again better than original sin that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings on of archaic spain for example people unloading goods from a cart on the street workers changing the candles of the street lamps all in the background of the action br br whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme like brian de palma's femme fatale carmen is a poignant modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double indemnity and is a delightful pleasure to watch this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over glitzy and safe hollywood fare
