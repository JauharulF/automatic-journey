<START> this is really bad the characters were bland the story was boring and there is no sex scene furthermore it lacks drama the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced nothing happens in this film you would expect a sex scene but they just have a kiss the plot revolves around three characters a man his wife and a stranger that they pick up from the high way the couple invite the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right no they just kiss and thats it also this film contains no action no comedy no drama and not even suspense makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script
<START> curse of michael myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series after a very disappointing letdown in halloween 5 the series reached a near ebb in plot lines with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers curse of michael myers ups the ante in blood and gore but really represents a decay in the series' integrity it's too bad to as this is the last movie for donald pleasance as the character of dr loomis pleasance has some good screen moments precious ones if your a fan of the series as the now very aged and as he says very retired doctor sadly he died before the movie was completed and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized right from the beginning credits halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made for tv movie then that of the block buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978 any loyal halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film dr loomis and donald pleasance deserved more
<START> what can i say not much to this one at all pretty dull and uninteresting br br the actors performances are just ok the only one that shines in any way is simmons but he only has maybe 3 scenes i understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has but i can't help but feel his talent was wasted no one else rose above mediocre br br the story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning but then just doesn't go anywhere there wasn't a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like i had just seen something special the cinematography was fairly bland i mean desert in a washed out sort of sepia not very inspiring br br the story of his childhood pal back outta prison seemed only partially thought out and didn't really add anything to the story other than making an average 'twilight zone' script into a full length feature br br drab
<START> not even hitch but simply a bad movie the cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man ugly in every way unimaginative script static point of view putrid clothing ghastly hair unlikable actors and one truly gratuitous rape and strangulation scene the director's perverse sense of humor is present but it is not applied consistently the movie comes alive only in its cruelty the women fare especially badly could be used as proof the director was a misogynist though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his tv series and 'psycho' which he himself described as an exercise in thrift an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature alfred hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for commerce in the great master seems to be bowing to convention trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want in the form of unappealing nudity nudge nudge winks and general nastiness i don't begrudge an old man his rest but i don't want to remember him tired and lazy and pandering time to watch again

<START> great film no gratuitous gimmicks like in most hollywood films everything supported the suspense of the plot b w gave it a basic no frills feel also in short it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast br br following serves as an interesting contrast to memento characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively in that sense both reminded me somewhat of in the company of men also highly recommendable one difference between nolan's two films is that memento was a little easier for me to follow given that the b w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction and so do those in color i don't think that was true of following where scenes seemed to be shown at random if you have the choice between vcr and dvd i'd highly recommend dvd since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order not just in the scrambled albeit ingenuous order presented by nolan it also makes it easier upon a second viewing to piece the order together for yourself if you want to br br as another viewer noted one of the best things about both this movie and memento is that none of the cast were famous they were characters not big name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies br br given certain similarities in the plots i wonder if memento is sort of a remake of following but intended to reach a bigger audience like edward burns made she's the one in the mold of and with largely the same cast as the brothers
<START> i actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then the deer hunter which was overrated both this movie and year of the dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie at three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half kris kristofferson and christopher walken are fighting over isabelle huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with sam waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed who is says are and thieves there is a great cast that also has jeff bridges brad dourif and a young mickey rourke
<START> i need help identifying an episode of king of queens it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with i love you however it's hard to do and he ends up calling her back only to close with i love you it's a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time br br i think but i'm sure that's it's the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at carrie to perk her spirits up br br i saw this episode recently but it was probably a repeat don't know what network i saw it on can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode
<START> this is one of the many techno phobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid 90s after the internet went mainstream br br hollywood movies have always had their way in the depicted ongoings to make them look better and more appealing the same happens when hollywood tries to show us some hi tech the outcome of such attempts varies from being very far fetched and ridiculous see hackers 1995 johnny 1995 etc to being quite realistic see sneakers 1992 br br the net lies somewhere between those extremes by nitpicking one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies and a lot of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more sexy and graphical than the way things are in real life as usually happens in movies br br however by simply overlooking those the viewer ends up with a quite solid entertaining movie the characters and acting are convincing and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it the plot is okay a fairly standard one really based on the good ol' paranoiac design but with a hi tech edge this time and quite convincing again when disregarding technical issues the development of the plot is a bit sluggish though and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plot br br the bonus here is cutie pie sandra bullock which besides being cute something she does quite easily apparently also portrays a solid act you can really feel her character her despair her emotions br br in the bottom line the movie is entertaining and interesting rates about 7 from 10 in my scale it's worth renting from the video library or even watching in the cinema whether to buy it or not is up to you
<START> very touching film a great surprise to come up from brazil a country that usually exports features about social themes violence sex magical realism is a very hard task and i believe joÃ£o has made it wonderfully it seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film far from that although many people think the film was adapted from the play he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book another mistake is to think that has been influenced by the series dia de maria the tv series produced by was made after the film but aired before unfortunately br br the negative point is the photography by walter carvalho it seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept has created the story is captivating and universal in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in brazil that could take place anywhere in the world a great movie i strongly recommend
<START> the second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm a girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness br br interesting plot very good acting but the result as a whole is poor in many ways the story is too simplistic or rather presented in a simplistic way even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists for example people say they love each other after only two meetings i don't want to reveal anything else but you see what i mean if you watch the movie come on it was the fifties you may think yet i 've seen quite a few films from that era and i know that some don't seem so dated nowadays br br something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark making it almost impossible to watch what was going on ok it's a film noir but this one is too noir at some points o br br overall the second woman is not a masterpiece of that era but no trash either watch it if you have nothing else to do
<START> at first i thought this film was going to annoy me it was as though i had seen this movie somewhere before the disillusioned hero the father figure and the 9 year old sister who is older and wiser than her years see gregory's girl but then not 15 minutes in it became a laugh out loud comic gem of a movie dylan moran who i thought was just going to bug me was excellent as was mr and the mad scottish hitman lena headey was extremely sexy for half of the film i was trying to remember where i'd seen her before the parole officer she has the most amazing smile but clearly the true hero of this film is mr caine this man should do much more comedy this ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles without a clue dirty rotten scoundrels he is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end br br no one can quite say f k the way michael can br br
<START> from 1950 comes a neat thriller about a couple smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the contagious disease smallpox evelyn keyes pulls out all stops as the essential victim of this film noir once back in the united states she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs other than keyes striking performance there is good support from villainous charles william bishop dorothy malone lola albright and whit bissell the finale is a humdinger with miss keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below a good b flick
<START> it gives the ordinary guy girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars br br for the majority of the time they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying br br another twist to it a team of make up people and costumers dress the contestant up like that singer they might not look like them but the likelihood of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim br br it's a load of fun for your saturday night and the contestants aren't raging wannabes like they are on another tv singing show the fact that there are no prizes involved and it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person br br the only gripe i have is with the kids version it looks like they have done the round of stage schools what happened to the normal kids
