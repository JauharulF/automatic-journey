<START> filmed less than a year after the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the subject matter was fresh in the minds of the cast the director and the audience most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war the soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming which is odd br br the afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed this film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil war br br there is no lack of powerful scenes one of the first is footage of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the ussr solders go about their work while an officer calmly ticks off the destinations moscow rostov the baltic br br an earlier comment describes the last scene with as illogical it is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film the only human relationship maintained was with the afghan family which he accidentally kills in the assault having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of the war turns his back on the boy and his gun in resignation to his fate br br i particularly liked the last scene a flock of mi rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells we're leaving boys we're leaving in a tone of sincere relief br br is an excellent film brutally honest and as as they come
<START> snakes on a train is a movie i rented due to the pure amusement of the thoughts i had about the movie snakes on a plane was an enjoyable action film so obviously the film makers wanted to cash in on the success with this low budget effort at 85 minutes snakes on a train is almost unbearable to witness i had to keep pausing the film to do something to entertain myself due to the lack of happenings in the film throughout the duration of the film it's never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she keeps coughing up this green purplish goo constantly not only that there is endless boring dialog of the two main characters brujo and alma discussing how to get rid of the curse i can appreciate low budget film making i'm truly not picky on movies i'm open to any genre or budget but snakes on a train is truly one of the worst horror films i have ever seen were the writers on acid or something at the end of this film why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake and most importantly how on earth was it able to devour the train br br bottom line snakes on a train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs don't be intrigued like i was by the title this is a movie that's seriously bad let's put these snakes to rest br br 0 10
<START> consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem the movie starts of as a fast stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone in an almost oliver stone kind of way it's of course also a very serious subject but i would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in br br for a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time the movie because of this feels like it isn't telling the whole story of course the following up of the events after the soviet occupation of afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesn't go deeper into it and it doesn't explain much about it which feels like a cheap way to just glorify charlie wilson without showing the other side of the medal also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified even though the story still gets told needlessly complex at times br br yes the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere the movie should had been for instance more like wag the dog that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues br br because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling the acting performances are also mixed when tom hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent but this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive shocking moments of the movie philip seymour hoffman is always excellent though as he is in any movie that he plays in he also received an oscar nomination for his role in this movie most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie just to be in the movie this goes mostly for julia roberts whose character i found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie she made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie br br it's not that the movie is a bad watch it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve br br 7 10
<START> this movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that crispin glover has ever played uma thurman and suzy amis are also great in this movie but crispin makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in new york
<START> well in all honesty it's beyond the boundaries of stupid but killer pussy is still one insanely entertaining little flick no plot tons of oiled up cha cheesy effects and a penis eating monster what's not to love pretty much a couple of explorers find this creature that likes to itself within a woman's beef curtains until a is unfortunately ah thrust into its mouth it finds it's host who is later discovered frozen in a deserted house by a group of moronic guys and their equally brainless slut girlfriends whose van breaks down the creature jumps from each girl as they all fornicate like drunken rabbits there's some cheap gore girl on girl blood wrestling ky jelly vomit sock puppet monsters and lots of soft core sex ridiculous but a cool waste of time
<START> love in limbo is my all time movie set in w a it is and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors russell crowe as arthur back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair aden young barry and craig adams as ken riddle br br ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and becomes expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates he starts a new job at his uncles clothing factory and becomes close with another new guy barry who buys a car so that they can go out and pick up chicks they become mates with the goody geek arthur crowe and the three guys drive up to to a brothel and lose their virginity br br watch it its a classic for so long i have been trying to get a hold of a dvd or soundtrack anyone let me know if you've got em
<START> is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending lauren ambrose plays who is trying to avoid college to make her overworked mother not notice she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote all the acting is first rate especially lauren ambrose and amy madigan they both put in great performances the climax is also very powerful there are only two bad parts first is the character of stewart worthy played by christopher lloyd his part is underdeveloped the other weakness is the ending it goes around in circles which i didn't expect with the 84 min run time besides that the movie is definitely worth watching
<START> the operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene this was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the harvard class of 1870 the point of that scene i suppose was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in johnson county wyoming but it just keeps going and going and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind numbing nothingness made even worse by the fact that i found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent in the end i couldn't even watch this in one sitting i got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before i could drag myself back to see how it turned out br br my reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame because there are positives here the performances are generally of a high calibre especially from kris as christopher walken as champion and isabelle huppert as ella the basic story interspersed as it is around that ever present mind numbing nothingness is potentially interesting focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in johnson county and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military there's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots having said that the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time and should have been in the end all those potential positives are washed out by again the mind numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around seriously 2 10
<START> apparently shrunken heads was the last movie that julius harris had a role in i have not seen all of his movies but julius harris was in many good movies and i remember him best from live and let die where he played tee hee and which was full of voodoo references something that is common here in south florida i always thought live and let die was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique unlike most of the 007 movies in shrunken heads julius harris is back in his voodoo persona he has a great style for mystery and the occult and his part in this movie is excellent sadly the rest of the movie is something of a comedy spoilers three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of the little rascals get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of fame or as a dancer on dick clark's american bandstand in other words these kids give low budget another dimension julius harris goes to the mortuary funeral home cuts off the three kids' heads and nobody notices and then takes them to his condominium unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids the three heads get tossed in along with some herbs spices and voodoo items at some point mr harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them and they come to life as talking heads they can fly make jokes roll their eyes and exact vengeance from the evil doers they usually look pretty funny flying around but the effects are not bad for some reason one of the kids always has a switch blade in his mouth and he uses it to slice people's necks and to cut holes into tires this movie is weird and funny but only the first time you see it meg foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than rosie o'donnell and meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters strange movie
<START> over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature and not because it's not without trying actually it is it's a shamble all the more because it's writer director technical everyman nick went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film sometimes a first time filmmaker full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed unsure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story the extremely personal side gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their patients with crazy group scare tactics psychological mind f sessions that could go on for days and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe escaped finally when he was 15 i'm glad he got out though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film making skills if only for a couple of days to learn things like say structure proper lighting fluid camera movement subtlety with actors and other basics that are perpetually lost here br br it's all the more frustrating because is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cult rehab many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas this is an ever nagging sensation throughout over the gw where it almost feels like wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate it properly through his characters the character that one would think is closest to him bronx teen tony serra gallagher who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey would be closest to is actually much more of a one dimensional being where there is very little back story we see a brief freak out in black and white in his old home and little connection to his mother moriarty who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another but there is a story to go with his two year crisis i guess br br right off the bat things get rough a nude cavity search in the first five minutes and soon it's clear that instead of medical care it's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect where the head doctor hiller is a total over controlling loon but soon tony's sister sofia gets thrown in to the program and as opposed to tony's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non compliance she goes head on through the whacked out three step program and once released becoming a runaway at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare where there's one woman a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she's become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them that do contain some raw power very brief glimpses of being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama br br but these are moments few and far between it's not just the unsuccessful characters who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical d a r e rip offs maybe some of them like an angry black youth the passive aggressive counselors or even older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them it's that is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny 30 000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through he over uses tints mostly with a shade that looks urine coated he his hand held dvx camera as if it's supposed to be intense ala city of god occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo indie soft rockers and there's even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra inspiration and that feel about as false as possible br br could just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would be artistically cathartic plan b bottom line no matter how much from the heart true life stories may appeal to you don't bother seeing it in the theater or even on rental unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital hued hudson river sunset with the final words reading dedicated to the kids oy
<START> this is the latest entry in the long series of films with the french agent o s s 117 the french answer to james bond the series was launched in the early 1950's and spawned at least eight films none of which was ever released in the u s 'o s s 117 cairo nest of spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not repeat not be taken too seriously our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in egypt with doing stand in for egypt to find out about a long lost friend what follows is the standard james bond inspector kind of antics although our man is something of an overt xenophobe sexist it's treated as pure farce as i said don't take it too seriously although there is a bit of rough language cartoon violence it's basically okay for older kids ages 12 up as previously stated in the subject line just sit back pass the popcorn just enjoy
<START> i'll give it a two for denis leary he had some good lines but that's it what was the point where was the script who was supposed to act a movie needs more than this one has to offer save the hour and a half to watch your hair grow or fall out whatever the case
<START> i watched this movie on tcm last night all excited expectation having last seen it twice in its memorable 1957 release in toronto i told my wife who hadn't seen it before to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot no cuts where veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her boris in a hand held frame that certainly predates the modern steadicam the shot then pulls back up and cranes pun unintended over the street as she exits the bus and darts among the tanks to cross the road then i remember that no cuts we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through anxiously looking for him but does not find him but we do continue to follow veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women all extras and each one a gem of riveting behavior how one wonders did and his cameraman set up this extraordinary sequence but what did i see in this version after crossing the street dodging the tanks the scene abruptly ended and cut back to scenes at the apartment before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence seems to me that this film was not only restored but also re edited what a downer
<START> all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious norman the viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master the bad guy would always be vowing to kill max with some insane cackling the writing is the best br br i was glued to the set when this would come on when i was younger if they came out with a dvd of all the episodes they made i would be forced to buy it this and a conan the barbarian cartoon are the ones i miss the most from childhood i think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons i used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the los angeles area br br i remember the owl was always afraid warning max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one max didn't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny he would say things like i eat monsters for breakfast when he was battling them and then when he was battling zombies he would say i eat zombies for nevermind classic cartoon comedy and action br br i vote that they re air mighty max
<START> after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine br br to this show's credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and dÃ©cor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended that's like shooting the first episode of gilligan's island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer br br personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 Â 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage
