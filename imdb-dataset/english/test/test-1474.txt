<START> because i would have never ever seen this movie through to the end although there are some but not many funny moments in this movie i couldn't understand more than about 15 the fancy english couple in the 3rd story included of what people were saying three short stories none with a real point with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people i could have imagined and a load of foul language didn't find it funny didn't find it amusing didn't find any sense in it 4 10
<START> a movie this dumb should never see the light of day the acting is lame the violence is just all over the place the sneaking ending is just plain stupid br br it's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the r i c c o squad no one has never seen him not even the hit men themselves so he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this r i c c o squad before they find them br br then the movie goes on to a romance gun shooting and voodoo now how in the hell did voodoo come in this never see this film if your life depends on it trust me
<START> flat spoilers br br five med students nelson kiefer sutherland david kevin bacon rachel julia roberts joe hurley william baldwin randy oliver platt decide to attempt an experiment dying for exactly 5 minutes it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage br br almost everyone does this experiment randy being the lone exception but they begin to have unwelcome visitors david sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him joe sees all the women he has had sex with and which he videotaped asking him why from the tv screen rachel relives her father's suicide and nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions br br why are they here and how will they get rid of them this tense and interesting movie set in an city and into a gothic med school is quite the experience both for the story and the characters played by then budding stars such as kiefer sutherland julia roberts oliver platt kevin bacon and william baldwin br br the director is joel schumacher who had already worked with sutherland in 'lost boys' and this second cooperation is even better than the first br br a must for psychological thriller horror buds and metaphor lovers this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs this is one of the minor classics from the '80s that get respect even today like the mention by rebecca in 'scream 2' or the calling episode which used the movie's premise br br 9 10
<START> i went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter good cast a director who had previously done the highly rated once were warriors and my liking for noir ish films set in l a in the forties and fifties i would argue that i am reasonably easy to please in this film category i appreciate the classics of the genre but i will sit through and enjoy a half decent if derivative effort as well however i found this film completely unbearable br br despite a good situation in which to place the story nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two hours plus of this sorry mess good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing the narrative is slack and drags unbearably and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death there is no drama no atmosphere no tension absolutely no entertainment value and by the end i simply didn't care what happened because i did not believe in anything in the film br br l a confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true to life the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department mulholland falls by contrast fails in every department a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved if they ever show this on a plane i will still walk out
<START> first of all i hate those moronic rappers who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like version of gangsters br br the movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie except for the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brain br br bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and character is just as much a villain as the gangsters i did'nt like him right from the start br br the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no one everybody dies except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve br br the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they're actors by profession not annoying ugly brain dead rappers br br stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead at lest they have characters you care about a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast
<START> robert deniro and eddie murphy what a team while rene russo william and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride this is a funny and a great movie not only is it that but it's a good buddy flick br br tom dey shanghai noon directs this hell of a movie from start to finish it was a masterpiece no slapstick humor here but good old time laughs making fun of all other cop flicks to name a few lethal weapon beverly hills cop fifteen minutes and etc br br if you want to see a movie see this one you'll love it it has a wonderful cast and crew so get off your a from watching cops and watch showtime for a cop film and remember they'll be your neighbor at um um oh at friday nights at 8 00 man everyone says i'm a bad writer
<START> blake edwards tried very hard to change julie andrews image in this film he tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was i think they were both still a bit irked that julie had not been chosen to film her broadway success of camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough unfortunately they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief it gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing rock hudson who we all know now was gay kissing julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie it seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that julie was a femme fatale but that rock was straight sadly they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out the other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making it is almost three separate movies there is the drama of julie as the german spy trying to get military secrets from rock there is an air war movie with lots of footage of wwi vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that blake edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not in this case it was not the only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely dame julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell like soprano of course if you love her you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her you can always tell yourself afterward that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through star
<START> i thought it was weird and just gory not scary i have seen a couple of the japanese horror films ringu and and loved them but this movie was a disappointment it never even explained anything about the curse i just didn't see any horror it wasn't scary to me at all the whole time i was watching i was waiting for to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now if this was some ancient curse why didn't it happen before father and it never told us what happened to her father i kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended i was very disappointed
<START> my wife and i never got into the movie we thought it was way to and to many subtitles i understood they needed them for vietnam but took to long to get out of asia she wanted it off i said it's going to get better it never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to america but i wanted to see him looking and finding his dad not at the end but forming a relationship did i mention it was i love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end i know they don't make many good movies now days i think action movies are the only ones to watch i have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster maybe 20 are worth seeing i don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good gary
<START> homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks but deserves better when i first saw it i had a luke warm reaction but over time it's really grown on me no pun intended the more i see it the more i appreciate it the writing is top notch as is the acting throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction and you end up with a great little film br br it's also good to finally see hank azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role and thornton delivers his usual quality performance even relative newcomer ryan phillippe delivers playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety br br on a side note homegrown is simply a must see if you're a billy bob thornton fan it appears stephen gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier thornton projects like one false move and sling blade though homegrown is certainly a lot more tongue in cheek than either and thornton's role as a character who is both sophisticated and down to earth is a perfect match for the actor
<START> i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim shot the movie three br br i did some swell pictures for him one of which i was told became the poster for the movie i didn't see the film until years later i thought it was bad a pity because the elements that went into it were compelling porter's girlfriend was as beautiful as rampling herself asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice i said sure but i had to return to ny promising i'd be back alas i never did get back one of life's unsung melodies br br i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere br br rowland
<START> from start to finish this 1926 classic two reeler from the hal roach studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's it stars the now forgotten comic genius charley chase and was directed by the legendary leo mccarey who was unknown then but would earn his keep with roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's recently released onto video and disc this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages although today his star has virtually diminished charley chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents he helped the careers of stan laurel and oliver hardy before they were brought together as a team leo mccarey and a host of other talents it is a shame that he is all but remembered today check out this little gem of a film once you do you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic he had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star
<START> where to begin this film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby however if you live outside the us and do follow the game it is laughable various rugby traditions such as the which is preformed by the new zealand all blacks and only by the all blacks the leader of the is usually the member of the team with the best pedigree this is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer the film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over all execution that lets it down heavily taking into account is is based on a real story it does posses a great deal of clichÃ©s in the storyline i would strongly suggest that any american interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is
<START> made the same year as the first lumiere films this is a much more dramatic short than the brothers attempted until the following year's the surviving print is very rough but this only adds to the visual violence as huge of water dash against a stolid pier and seem ready to engulf the camera the viewer br br if you watch a number of these early shorts in chronological order and try to get into the mindset of the times there is a further shock in that unlike the single frame set ups of the lumieres this film features an edit which for me at any rate was as slashing as the razor blade in 'un chien br br unlike the mono vision of the films paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives freeing the viewer from the power of nature eluding its grasp in a way the lumieres never could the second shot features a similar gush to that of niagara but is less frightening because by way of the edit we have sidestepped the danger in a film like or du nature stands indifferent and powerful by the camera basic film grammar puts an end to its supremacy
<START> now i watched this when i was hungover one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins one was 11 the other 9 we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just started my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked since i was in no fit state to get up i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film i have to say as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films i actually enjoyed it it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between 6 and 13 but it was a movie to pass the time there's always a movie or a show that you don't think you'll like but for a laugh you enjoyed it
