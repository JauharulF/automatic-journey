<START> i rarely watch short films as they only seem to be on late night television and are not publicised enough for me to know which short films are worth while as the room is an extra feature on the hitcher dvd it gave me a wonderful opportunity to witness a high quality short with rutger hauer in excellent form br br artistically shot in black and white the room explores a man's obsession with a room he passed by in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in a documentary interview style the dialogue is very poetic typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman but is also juxtaposed with ramblings and occasional deficiencies in this adds great realism and depth to performance who is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him br br the piano music that harry hauer hears from the room is constantly in the background and enhances the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by hauer br br hauer proves he is more than just a psychotic hollywood bad guy with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side is also effective in the flashback scenes as young harry with a silent role he shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it goes away br br the ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature length films a very good effort
<START> writer director jay andrews a k a jim wynorski serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade z computer generated reptiles in komodo vs cobra as generic a rip off of mysterious island meets jurassic park as you can imagine the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful however the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims not that any of this is in the least believable clearly komodo vs cobra had a budget that so low that virtually everything non human in its looks as fake as all get out this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u s military conducts top secret dna testing on animals the result is that gigantic and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise as the action opens the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim after we are introduced to a group of like environmental protesters and a journalist planet one organizer jerry ryan ryan of hellbent pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard michael pare of cbs tv's houston knights five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island meanwhile the u s military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the predators our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island dr susan richardson michelle of wonderland the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island there's no tension suspense or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck orchestral soundtrack it gives komodo vs cobra an epic feel usually jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel but this ranks far below his low standards the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys in one scene our heroic group fords a river and we don't get to see any wet t shirts drat there's nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire let's hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought it's not so bad it's good it's just bad
<START> the merchant of venice 8 10 br br this review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and so may be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plot br br as a film version of the famous shakespeare play merchant of venice does what few adaptations have done since polanski's rather gritty macbeth it takes the spirit of the play and brings it out not just as well as but better than the play alone could readily achieve br br lord of the rings director peter jackson has argued that in adapting a book or play there are three options attempt to replicate the original as perfectly as possible use the original idea as an inspiration but take full license for cinematic change or the one he avowedly preferred stick to the original as much as is cinematic ally viable but make such changes as are necessary for the film and while remaining faithful to the intention or spirit of the original br br in macbeth polanski used the rain sodden beaches and realistic rapes and murder to convey what a bloody and horrific period the play was set in thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill advised decisions it differs from say branagh's hamlet which achieved new heights of faithful rendition but otherwise offered little new macbeth on the other hand maybe enabled audiences fresh to shakespeare to appreciate some of the drama's fullness without extensive study similarly more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the stage performance could accomplish such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage not only intellectually but also emotionally with the points shakespeare wanted to make br br adaptation of merchant of venice does just this it takes crucial moral dilemmas involving religious bigotry or the keeping promises and with minimal messing of the bard's holy tome conveys them faithfully within the spirit of the original story br br the first of these religious bigotry gives meaning to otherwise outlandish behaviour we see the jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap not being allowed to own property one of the few ways they can earn a living is by money lending this makes them both useful to their christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their vilification the idea behind both old and new testament biblical prohibitions against usury probably stems from not making a profit by helping one's friends this is extended by the bigoted christians to curse those they spit on we see shylock not only spit on but fellow jews thrown into the for sport in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening br br the of the film is curious since the bigotry of right wing christianity as personified by bush following americans has turned full circle as they are now the main supporters of zionism and the jewish political leaders bite at their palestinian neighbors much as shylock tries to bite at antonio once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so the psychology is self evident kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious the circle easily continues as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values and become oppressors br br the stringent of hand that the disguised uses to save antonio has some merit both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the of the play so rue and also as a moral pointer shylock may 'have his pound of flesh' according to his contract but may not have any blood an easy analogy could be made as far as warfare and terrorism goes it is much easier to justify fighting among combatants or attacking ill doers if soldiers or evil doers are the only victims when there is massive collateral damage as when innocent citizens including women and children are killed in their hundreds the arguments whether those be israeli palestinian or us american carry far less popular support br br there has long been much argument whether shakespeare was being anti semitic in this story one wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a largely christian audience who had little dealing with jewish people far from teaching him a greater good the ending enforces christianity and humiliation upon shylock a course likely simply to perpetuate pent up resentment both camps look just as bad one simply holds more power than the other the slight of the judgment simply gives the christian judges a better public image or as so acutely observes when choosing the caskets and solving the riddles to win hand br br in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts br br of course the bigotry applies to organised religion rather than spirituality especially when organised for political purposes but one that easily ordinary god fearing people who are not in the habit of splitting hairs the kindness mercy in judaism which is so fundamental to true christianity is something also practiced to a wonderful degree in judaism as in most creeds the jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity ways of practicing both effectively and ways of making it part of one's being rather than just an outward show both shylock and antonio are bigoted and use their respective faiths to abuse those of another faith while shakespeare maybe pointed up the chasm between the goodness prescribed by different faiths and its absence in practice the film version reduces much of the window for interpretations of anti semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes br br the keeping of promises the men to their wives is dealt with less well as are the comic elements inherent in the cross dressing sub plots however strong his love for antonio are there homosexual elements there cannot make sound moral judgements when showing his gratitude to the and so breaks his promise for which forgives him displaying a character for women not only as supremely intelligent and witty but also as more truly merciful and considerate of others than her bigoted male counterparts including her husband br br some of the acting is a bit stilted and there are too many regional english accents but on the whole merchant of venice delivers a fresh and rewarding reworking of shakespeare i enjoyed the acting and also the very beautiful soundtrack by hayley and others singing ballads penned both by shakespeare and edgar allen poe all in all merchant of venice is a not achievement of british as far as any film can be said to be of a particular nationality these days cinematic tradition
<START> i don't mind sequels sometimes they're better than the original however many times the originals are best left alone especially when you can't duplicate the cast one of the big reasons the magnificent seven was such a hit was the very popular cast br br this is hardly the magnificent seven when only yul brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group in the magnificent seven with six of the seven guys absent and replaced by much lesser known actors this loses its appeal in a hurry in other words except for brynner these guys have no charisma this is a like a championship sports team fielding all substitutes except one br br brynner is good once again fun to watch fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice of his but the story not just the rest of the crew is lame this movie should never have been made in the original we cared about the seven in here we couldn't care less
<START> pixote a lei do mais deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes poverty and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings prostitution violence crime rape and murder br br brazil is the country of paradoxes and its social problems are present everywhere the difference between the rich and the poor the beautiful and the ugly happiness and the most profound human decay br br pixote is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope in an honest portrayal of a country that like pixote himself is already lost
<START> if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school try to convince your teacher to see something else believe me anything is better than this movie it is slow paced confusing boring poorly constructed gory do i need to go on it's message is good but i have seen them been handled better in several other films the acting isn't even any good this movie is just even more awkward as it start off as being funny not intensional though because of it's surreal story than at the end just becomes uncomfortable to watch br br i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear witness a sort of rape than see the female lead role eat her husband br br honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1 10 and if your not happy with my preview seriously i'm an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism but this movie was just awful make any excuse you can to avoid this film
<START> if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn't it if you're looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn't it if you're looking for something hardcore this isn't it br br that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early mid 1970's this is it br br i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974 yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllables br br if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80's and recently 90's adult stars the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive ins in the late 1970s br br i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax many people become upset when later in life it doesn't live up to their previous memories it's understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays erotica br br if you compare to a modern soft core erotic comedy you may be disappointed the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very little br br it is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european erotic comedic cinema of the 1970's
<START> i don't know where to begin perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping i don't know what was more offensive the subject matter or david arquette's performance it was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off although i think the bull felt better afterwards the filmmakers should find something about sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show like i don't know his talent as a singer his family shouldn't have to relive that horror thank god it was just shown on hbo and not released in theaters please don't watch this if you have any self respect
<START> first of all i'm not one to go all sappy over movies i saw friends in the 70's when it was first released i was about 17 years old at the time even now at age 50 i still can remember some of the scenes the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it the story is about innocence the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home at the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own i'm not surprised the movie and elton john's soundtrack are almost unknown today the music is beautiful it was unforgettable
<START> ramsay Â the kings of comedy or was it horror whatever wake after years of hibernation and yes i did get scared no not because of the horror element of course i am not that squeamish but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the theatre where else do such movies run br br so check the plot a man is repeatedly stabbed choked to death stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool but he still returns to take revenge now was the film a thriller or a horror that itself is the suspense for you to discover and the end turns out to be another mask mystery remember those trademark ramsay undercover agents Â men wearing some stupid horror masks only here the mask is of a human i suppose no more detailing is required to skip this flick br br tends to get over dramatic and theatrical forgetting the difference between cinema and tv soaps a cheaply and dressed in her typical pink lipstick looks like Â uh you know what br br the background score is a straight lift from alfred hitchcock's psycho not a single department of the film whether technical or creative is worth commenting novelty lacks both in story and execution br br certainly your senses
<START> man this movie is awesome especially the part they show the italian chick damn shes incredibly hot shes not your average italian i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick i really enjoyed the movie really hot girl shes steamy sexy also the actor are really good but the girl is better i think the actor played a better part in pride and prejudice so i don't think he acted in his highest level but yeah back to the girl i mean shes gorgeous perfect and i could only wish her luck in her future movies yeah also her acting skills in such young age was awesome i was just amazed wit her performance what a great actress so yeah i recommend everybody this great movie
<START> being the sci fi fan that i am i was always curious about this film so i was excited to see journey to the far side of the sun finally get released on an affordable dvd the previous print had been fetching 100 on ebay i'm sure those people wish they had their money back but more about that in a second br br anyway the premise of this film just like twilight the parallel is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling earth on the other side of the sun this planet is of course exactly like ours except that it's inverted this basically means their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road br br sound intriguing well that's basically all there is to this film the first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet it's just tedious scenes of switches being pressed banal dialog etc there's no point to it whatsoever gerry anderson managed to find the most boring british actors in the history of cinema to play most of the roles i mean they are so dull i'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film br br anyway once the crew finally lands on the planet after an interminable sequence of the astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit roy thinnes notices the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and hops back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered oops he never gets to do it as he crash lands and dies the end oh wait there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives hurling himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end i guess he wanted out of this film too br br i'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s rent if you must do not buy
<START> first of all before i start my review i just read every review for 'the muppet movie' here and i can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this fortunately there was only one i mean i can understand how someone may not like 'star wars' due to the whole sci fi genre but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad br br okay i will step off my soapbox now and review this movie br br 'the muppet movie' came out when i was seven all of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie so i think i saw it about four times in the first month in theaters br br as a child many things attracted me to this and all the other muppet movies tv shows the singing was probably the main one most of the songs in 'the muppet movie' are classics from rainbow connection to i'm going to go back there someday they're entertaining and thought provoking br br as an adult i see 'the muppet movie' in almost a whole different light yes the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there but it's the little jokes and such that are just plain hilarious br br i mean when you think about it jim henson is a sick man br br kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces fozzie is a stand up comedian bear gonzo is a that is infatuated with chickens then you have two old guys that heckle a piano playing dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a swedish chef that you can't understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric br br yet for these reasons and more henson has entertained millions of children and adults giving us all something special to watch and remember him by br br 'the muppet movie' will always remain in my heart for many reasons but i think the biggest one is because it's a movie unlike a lot of recent children's movies that i feel comfortable to have my kids watch plus i don't get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids' level br br it's a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever
<START> now i remember what the filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction it was david lynch right br br i hunted this thing down to see kyle secor what a waste of a perfectly good bayliss it was so painful to watch him sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do br br nearly every cliche in the book the desert the psycho the quirky mob boss the biker tracy walker who fortunately was only in one scene but i kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like if a man wants to know where he's going he's got to look at where he's been or some contrived garbage like that i have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert i think it's because they can save money on lighting br br if you like to be in pain find this movie and give it a viewing if you're a fan of kyle secor watch reruns of homicide on court tv if you want a good quirky road thriller check out wild at heart br br there is a reason that no one has heard of delusion my god what a waste of a good title
<START> this was the first chan film made by monogram what a come down from fox values and standards i was shocked when i saw my first monogram after seeing the great fox films this is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as chan calmly walks across the street chan is now working for the us secret service rather than the honolulu police department he is assisted by benson fong who plays no 3 son tommy for the first time he also has a daughter along iris chan played by marianne mantan moreland also makes his debut as birmingham brown he is a cab driver in washington dc here rather than the later chauffeur to chan in the later films
