<START> it's not just that the movie is lame it's more than that this movie is just unnecessary do we need another western how about a western with afro americans in the titles roles sound stupid implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre it is incredibly lame and simple minded it's like that lame baz film romeo and juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his of a classic tale well baz failed miserably and so does this mess the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro american cast is racist in itself it's also puerile and simple minded like baz man he's a bad director hey i hear you say this was directed by mario van peebles he's also in the film how can it be racist it's not i said the idea of casting all afro americans instead of caucasians was the film isn't racist it's just pointless stupid and very very boring
<START> musical bios are all cut of the same cloth hopeful struggles succeeds and finally wins the girl but this one a life of irish tenor chauncey jack chancellor has more going for it than the usual trappings it has great charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned dennis morgan is fine in the lead as is arlene dahl as his love interest andrea king's supporting performance as lillian russell is far better than alice faye's leading bio performance in the film dedicated to her career william frawley is touching as the aging tenor champion william scanlon and sara is lovely as mother george tobias ben blue and alan hale lend good support there are over 25 songs a true treasure chest come down my evening star my blue eyes you tell me your dream wait till the sun shines nellie will you love me in december by the light of the moon minstrel days polly doodle the and the robert e lee miss lindy lou if i'm dreaming wee rose of shake hands one little girl a little bit of heaven mary sweet um when irish eyes are smiling mother the fair room in my heart my wild irish rose br br although the film only earned one oscar nom for scoring and deservedly it also deserved nods for art direction and costume design sumptuous and lovely in technicolor br br reasons why this is not on video may be due to the large chunk of time spent within the minstrel show atmosphere at least a quarter of the film with a great deal of material quite politically incorrect for today's audiences it's historically accurate however br br this is a true gem and very worth seeking out it leaves one with a warm glow
<START> the death collector is truly a wonderful film labeled as a mean streets ripoff it has some really great stuff in it a lot of the stuff in this movie would later be used by scorsese himself including the actors joe pesci frank vincent etc
<START> depressing black black comedy about a woman mia farrow who flees her house on christmas eve when she discovers her husband tony goldwyn has hired a hit man to kill her she ends up with a husband and wife scott glenn and mary louise parker and then things go wrong basically farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting very strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations br br this was advertised as a feel good movie when i saw it around christmas time at its very short run in an art cinema i found it sick unfunny and just depressing i like black humor but this was way too dark for me what happens to parker's character especially was horrifying to make matters worse eileen brennan is thrown in as a nun later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto br br the only saving grace was acting it's much better than this picture deserves also it was a relief to see the very talented stephen dorff pop up at the end the ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn't erase what had gone on before br br sick morbid pitch black comedy a 1
<START> by the standards of hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big time production studio within hollywood thats where anything remotely close to having hollywood standards ends this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not joking the story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that i could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film i know what you're saying its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it's supposed to scare you well let me tell you something the movie is not even scary in the least bit its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been the acting was awful as well along with the scariness of the murderer who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off throughout the movie i kept getting a sense i was watching something that was thought up written produced and directed by a high schooler who watches too much pornography please don't see this movie spend your 8 50 on other things like a snow cone which would be much more worth your while
<START> i absolutely fell in love with living in a big way when i first saw it reason 1 is because i love adore and am a huge fan of gene kelly he was such a wonderful dancer actor and choreographer not to mention his extremely handsome looks and his sensual personality i love his role in this movie he was such a gentleman this movie showcased his wonderful talent for acting i enjoyed marie macdonald as well it was my first time of ever seeing or knowing anything about her and this excellent movie made me a fan of her's as well actually the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great the humor between the butler and the father mr morgan mrs morgan's courtroom humor and especially grandmother morgan's immediate attachment to and concern for leo and gene's number fido and me is adorable the opening dance number with gene and marie is very nice too i would recommend that anyone see this movie it will truly remain dear to your heart forever or at least it has to mine and you'll fall in love with gene all over again i rate it my 2 favorite gene kelly movie and i've seen and own a quite many of his movies they're a part of my daily routine so trust me when i tell you you'll love this movie watch it and enjoy
<START> the most accurate description of how billy crystal fairs in my giant is to say that this movie is to his career as ishtar was to warren it didn't ruin it but it slowed it down a lot crystal should know the three golden rules of hollywood 1 never play opposite a kid 2 never play opposite an animal 3 never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you is as innocent as a kid and acts like an animal br br what is this story a comedy i guess but i didn't laugh except at the scenes where crystal is on his own and not burdened with his what is her role in this movie ex wife or the afore mentioned giant did i mention there's also a kid in this film well forget about him the son is brought in to make us feel sorry for crystal and we do but for the actor not the character billy crystal is a funny man if you don't believe me watch him in old episodes of soap or saturday night live go rent city slicker or running scared or when harry met sally br br giant is more ho hum than fee fi fo br br
<START> i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great this series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation the all night wicker place club flamingo i don't think i've ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes overall the series is a must see for those who like puns bad jokes and slapstick sight gags
<START> let's get this out of the way so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word breasts and you know who you are can move along this is not in any way pornographic on the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker didn't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on indeed i would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on dvd or if it ever plays again late night on hbo or cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh well you get the idea br br no this is semi serious film making meant for premium late night viewing but it shouldn't have to be just for the late night types this is intimate in setting but not in tone all of the women in all their variety of shapes and sizes and races and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts have something of value to say from life experience in the most straightforward way if i say semi serious it's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in with the archival footage of old how to videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super rare cartoons with the knockers flying about this isn't a problem but an asset we need a few little visual ways to go between these interviews br br nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form they don't need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort discomfort curiosity motherhood and sadly cancer in that last part there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast you know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi normal life with one breast the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it and you don't snicker or go eww gross that's the test folks br br it's not shot under the best of circumstances but then again for tv it's edited with a tight pace it's never dull for a moment and we never feel like anyone is holding back especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men breasts a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare if that's worthy of a i was alone session then well more power to you i guess though it's not the intention
<START> i would probably want to give this movie a zero if not for the climax which involves not really snakes on a train but rather train in a snake the premise was cooked up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about snakes on a plane in production this in fact was released to coincide with that film's release the joke is probably not lost on those who will seek this out i don't think there would be a soul out there who would consider this anything as a serious action thriller effort unless on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought it's about a mayan curse placed on a woman who's damned by her family for leaving with another man and is soon seen sickened and coughing up green slime laced with of course snakes she and her beau go on a train headed for los angeles and very soon after the more than clichÃ© characters are privy to snakes overtaking the train with the originator woman becoming a snake herself br br if it would be worth listing more about the movie i would but there isn't enough time during the day all that can be said for the quality factor is that it's almost on existent there are student short films with larger budgets maybe that was a wise calculation on the filmmakers' end that there would be so many copies sold just for the joke factor alone that they would re coup their budget in the first weekend because by looking at the sets the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene the actors if you can call them that with only one other actor the one with the very thin hair who hits on the one woman throughout the movie who benefited from the flick being produced the fx also next to non existent making the effects in snakes on a plane seem like star wars and the actual cgi snakes themselves with the final huge behemoth snake something to behold in sci fi movie channel terms br br this all means basically that it is a laugh riot every step of the way especially as cruel as it sounds when a little girl becomes involved in a snake's attention with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor this being said it is also 100 disposable like a b movie sour flavor lollipop
<START> when i rented this movie i half expected it to be a low budget plot less indy film but thought i'd give it a try i started watching part 1 and couldn't pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later it was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time from the writing to the directing to the performances i was laughing crying and singing all the way through nan rite of passage from innocence to adulthood rachael stirling is phenomenal in this film i had never heard of her before but now i will forever remember the vulnerability and strength i felt in her performance she hawes and may are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoils that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality the fact that the film is set in the 1890's not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that time period but makes a statement about our society today you must see this film and probably like myself you'll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection
<START> shia labeouf has impressed me before with his acting ability but i can honestly say that i very much look forward to his next efforts his portrayal of francis a 20 year old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enters the 1913 us open tournament in his hometown the beginning of the movie does drag a bit but it's necessary to set up the underdog subplot that shia works so well the entire cast is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that based on the actual event has an ending everyone can discover before seeing the movie but even knowing that information doesn't spoil the fun josh flitter is delightful as eddie lowery francis' caddy who keeps him grounded and loose while at the same time proving to be an invaluable part of francis' effort stephen delane is outstanding as harry the legendary british golfer who francis idolizes yet does not fear and who knows the background francis comes from as he too had humble beginnings bill paxton takes a formulaic movie and makes it worthwhile bravo mr paxton and bravo to the cast from the imagery to the story to the people who bring it alive this is a movie to get enjoy and revel in it's nice to have movies like this that we can feel good watching
<START> this starts off in pennsylvania in 1913 a bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion purposely set off by the mine's owner cut to 2006 recently widowed karen lori her teenage daughter sarah scout taylor compton and little girl emma chloe move to a remote house located near that mine what they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark br br slow and boring horror movie the premise is obvious and has been done to death already also there are huge gaps in logic in the story it's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody or why they eat the bodies afterwards yes it's shown they're dead already why do they need food and why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before he was around the area why pick this time to attack him also the characters aren't the least bit likable sarah comes across the worst it has a few saving graces the location is beautiful and eerie at the same time some of the killings were very bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked spooky silently walking through the woods at night but all in all i was bored and fighting to stay awake you can skip this one
<START> wow what a cheesy movie this is it starts off looking like it's gonna be a backwoods slasher with the camera following dogs running through the woods it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath it suddenly gets really cheesy when the zombie indians arise from the earth and start terrorising the girls we even get a samurai indian br br this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting once the indian zombies or whatever you want to call them for they aren't technically zombies start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins this is not a special flick and can't be taken seriously it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends i can't help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring
<START> i am the sort of person who never ever watches animated movies but i make an exception for and the swan princess being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it i finished the movie and all i can think is the horror i wanted to like it i really did i tried very very hard to like it but i couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film br br i am going to try repress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third br br do yourself and favor and don't waste your time
