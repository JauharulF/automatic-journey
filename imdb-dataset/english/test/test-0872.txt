<START> i like many folks believe the 1989 epic lonesome dove was one of the best westerns ever produced maybe the best and realizing that most sequels in this case a prequel are certain to disappoint my expectations were low comanche moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting poor casting and frankly a lousy script br br lonesome dove created western heroes of captains and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones prior to living in lonesome dove we believed they bravely fought to rid texas of bandits and savage indians during their years br br if i had only seen comanche moon i would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent cowardly idiots in lonesome dove call and supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him in comanche moon a shot to call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle there wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries the best punch was mccrea sucker punching inez scull a funny scene but out of character for br br where was wit and charm clara's love for a drunken unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible and maggie's love for call a dispassionate and sullen loner defies logic br br the cinematography was excellent superior to the original credit goes not only to hd technology but the cinematographer the comanche moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights but sadly that's not saying much
<START> went to the premiere at the tribeca film festival in nyc and i absolutely loved the film i am diane's 1 biggest fan and of course as always she gave a magnificent performance i have seen every single one of her movies and i must say that this is one of my new favorites diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away donald sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious anton yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance all in all i recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie 10 thumbs up i would definitely go see it again and again and again this is the best film of the year so far
<START> although it may not be cassavetes' best work minnie and moskowitz is almost perfect in all its endeavours the plot is whimsical and charming and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotion much more drama than comedy contrary to imdb's profile yes the story is whimsical but not arbitrary it succeeds as believable albeit a tad forced which i will come back to all of the artistic aspects are of true cassavetes form the cinematography and camera work are delights and the soundtrack albeit barely there is complimentary plus i believe i noticed some nods to godard and such in the editing as i have in a few of cassavetes' other films namely the abrupt cutting of a song in one scene which are interesting br br i feel the plot is built up nicely with the first half being particularly enjoyable seymour's conversation with morgan morgan timothy carey in the diner for example is wonderfully funny and fascinating and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film this philosophising a tradition in cassavetes' films is what made the film for me seymour's amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one may have of him as a hippie though his character is curiously similar to that of his in faces 1968 this tipped me however on second viewing into the opinion that it stands up against cassavetes' best work i gained an affection for this film that i lacked on first viewing br br there are sadly several aspects that make this film imperfect i find the plot to be unbalanced as i said before it builds up nicely but it wanes a bit here and there particularly towards the end because of the spontaneous style in which cassavetes worked and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise the quality of his product can easily go either way in this case it's inconsistent i assess that most of this film was improvised and most of it beautifully but one or two scenes unfortunately just don't work in particular the scene after seymour fights with work associate outside her house during what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue presuming some was planned beforehand this i believe was a mistake one gets the impression cassel doesn't quite know what to do as he repeatedly fumbles in his speech often not making sense and overacts all of this damaging the scene and the character development i understand seymour is intended to be a bit of a brash fool but cassel's attempts here are why does he cut his moustache off these flaws are resulting from a lack of direction on cassavetes part a lack of understanding and forethought on cassel's part a lack of rehearsal and preparation etc evidently cassavetes didn't learn from his mistakes as he allowed this same thing to happen in his next film a woman under the influence 1974 the committing scene and ending br br the flaws i mention are not minor but they do not ruin the film they simply make some scenes cringe worthy and unrealistic spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential however i am very very fond of cassavetes and all of his actors particularly cassel in spite of the faults i mentioned this is a very enjoyable film although it proves the of cassavetes' style
<START> i've read the book and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like br br one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate br br there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two a fine movie but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was had it more true to alexandra book
<START> i saw this last night at a screening for a marketing company it is and was a lot of fun to watch it held my attention all the way through and did not seem to lag at all i'd recommend watching it when it airs
<START> a very hyped up slick edgy reinterpretation br br they've fallen into the because it's modern it has to be hyped up slick etc trap br br romeo and juliet carried this idea off much more successfully but i really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here period piece vs edgy film br br just because this is a modern retelling doesn't mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad or have anything to do with drugs or guns br br if the trappings were as subtle as the words macbeth would be a far more powerful film as it is read your shakespeare read it out loud ask your oxford dictionary some questions skip the film or don't but you've been warned br br sorry for the super long review imdb made me do it
<START> i saw this the week it opened four years ago and i really did not know what to expect being unfamiliar with work at the time he has created a very intriguing and ultimately moving account of an odd character one for whom the phrase 'life is for living' no longer applies it outwitted me at every turn and i was constantly surprised by the story i enjoyed the pacing very much and the way i was gradually given the pieces to work out what was happening tony is superb as is magnani it opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and concludes with a very moving image that takes the movie into sublime territory i thought long afterwards about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and i didn't shake it for weeks i recently bought the film and that final scene where he thinks about his friend gets me every time i still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this it's a shame that it did not reach a wider audience as if this is the direction of italian cinema it can only be a good thing
<START> i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done where is tate anyway it has been awhile since i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie
<START> this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly each of the three teenage girls offer their own believable distinct assertive and entertaining personalities i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa if one looked beyond the superficial action that was taking place keith's character treated lisa's deflowering with tenderness and consideration the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle dialogue was sharp quick and flowed nicely the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled although the movie appears light on the surface it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult human emotions and desire
<START> the year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon two rival bond films octopussy starring roger moore was part of the official cubby broccoli bond franchise never say never again made by a rival producer is apart from the awful casino royale the only bond movie which does not form part of that franchise its big attraction was that it brought back the original bond sean connery its title reputedly derived from connery's remark after diamonds are forever that he would never again play the role some have complained that connery was at 53 too old for the role but he was in fact three years younger than his successor moore who not only made octopussy in the same year but went on to make one further bond film a view to a kill two years later br br the film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to ian fleming's work it is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of thunderball as that was perhaps not the greatest of the connery bonds a remake of dr no or goldfinger might have worked better the plot is much the same as that of the earlier film the terrorist organisation spectre acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named largo have stolen two american nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money it falls to bond of course to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles br br the film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful bond girls of all barbara carrera as the seductive but lethal blush and kim basinger as largo's girlfriend domino who defects to bond's side after learning of her lover's evil plans a number of the bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or female accomplice there are similar developments for example in goldfinger live and let die and the living daylights in the official series bond's ally is normally regarded as the female lead but here carrera playing the villainess is billed above basinger who was a relatively unknown actress at the time basinger of course has gone on to become one of hollywood's biggest stars whereas carrera is one of a number of bond girls who have somewhat faded from view br br of the villains max von sydow makes an effective the head of spectre but klaus maria brandauer seemed too bland and nonthreatening as largo except perhaps during the domination game a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as space invaders that were so popular in the early eighties brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native german in films such as mephisto and but he does not comes across so expressively in english br br one of the film's features is that it both follows the normal bond formula and at times departs from it there is the standard world in peril plot chase sequences a series of exotic locations glamorous women sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title there is however no extended pre credits sequence and we see some familiar characters in a new light for example bond's boss m becomes a languid supercilious aristocrat his american colleague felix is shown as black for the only time and the scientist q is portrayed by alec as a disillusioned cynic with despite his characteristically upper class christian name of algernon a distinctly working class accent there is also an amusing cameo from rowan atkinson as a bumbling british diplomat although connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable bonds 7 10 br br a goof rowan atkinson's character states that he is from the british embassy in as however the bahamas is a commonwealth country britain would have a high commission in its capital not an embassy
<START> i love love love this show whether you say it's because i'm insane in the brain or not i think this show is very funny and entertaining although sometimes uncle vito scares me so all in all i give this show a perfect review and so i really think if you're into the omg what an idiot kind of humor this show is for you it's really funny to see the look on the prank peoples faces and there are many musical guests who come to house buy this cause it rocks you should buy it yes and brother is in the band and they are really good and sometimes come on the show br br bottom line is please watch the show
<START> folks is a comedy about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're going senile and want to be put out of their misery several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind saving them from his death traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process the movie seems to hate its main character which makes it all the more painful to watch there's also the usual tacked on love interest and predictable ending br br this movie was also the first time i'd seen tom selleck without a mustache and i remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie
<START> i guess those who have been in a one sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character yuko tanaka a 50 year old woman who is still in the pink of good health as demonstrated by her daily grinding routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work where she has to lug bottles of in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork to exchange empty bottles for full ones and to collect payment and issue receipt and there's always be that one delivery stop that's right at the top needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction br br and peculiar enough that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life and not having the product appreciated but poured down the sink having gone to the same school we see that they're not talking to each other and in their daily life always seem so close physically but yet so far away there's no eye contact save for cursory glances by chance and little acknowledgement of each other's existence we learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together where clear attraction between the two was hampered from developing further by the earlier generation br br while i thought was an interesting woman in herself one who has kept her feelings suppressed for so long one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do if i read that the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books and it's accurate i felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well stocked bookcase likely alluding to the fact that she's not alone after all and had probably fallen back on her crutch of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone and back to a lifestyle which she had already been accustomed to for 50 years besides immersing herself in two jobs she has those books which serve as a form of escapism and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio br br yuko tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love none other her object of affection was a more interesting character who has more facets staying true to marriage vows he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his sickly bedridden wife played by while juggling with his job of social welfare in the children's affairs department in city hall i felt that as a childless couple the job provided him a means to care not for his own but for other people's children the troubled ones who are neglected and left to fend for themselves in a rare moment of rage we see how he angrily chides such wayward parents who don't appreciate and wastes their children's lives away br br the story by kenji aoki provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well such as how is a hopeless haiku poet despite being a member of the haiku club and supporting characters such as the aged couple where koichi lent some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned senile while wife watanabe narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at 50 even performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of arresting with her character's enlightened state of knowing her husband's past and making unselfish and painful decisions in her sickly state br br it's what you can expect from a typical japanese romantic movie sans young nubile leads as star crossed lovers but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups love songs and those quintessential restrained but affectionate behaviour i thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love gets consummated but director akira managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict especially if you're already way past your romance movie 101 br br not being your average lovey dovey story i thought the told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme and frankly a recommended romance movie though told at a measured pace if you're in the mood for some bittersweet loving reminiscence and seeking to live without regrets
<START> true there are some goofs for the one who wants to find them they're not important though br br the primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft kristin scott thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman but one who has been hurt same for harrison ford who for the ladies is just as beau as kristin is belle for us guys br br their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner but one in which they find support in each other how they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers the viewer cannot help but feel what they feel nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together br br yes there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops but they only spice it up a little and are not a significant part of the movie br br for the lover of music dave provides a superb jazz based background featuring trumpeter terrence blanchard like the actors shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene br br not a movie for the lovers of guts blood and gore but for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside watch a beautiful english actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act like harrison ford to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of dave and terrence blanchard this is a move to watch with someone you love preferably in bed br br i thought it deserved at least an 8
<START> this wonderfully witty comedy drama wowed the crowd at the philadelphia film festival whipping them into wild applause at its conclusion by adept performances by a nuanced cast sturdy execution by director jeff hare a brisk pace and one of peter falk's best performances in years the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and woes of family life br br falk excels as jewish morris a wildly eccentric shakespearean thespian who decides to end his life but not before rounding up his three grown children and throwing a big fat jewish suicide party the film brims with indelible delights there's morris's room laura san passionate rendering of morris's cynical daughter rapid fire comedic dialogue that recalls the work of neil simon and woody allen the wry timing of david paymer who plays morris's tightly wound psychotherapist son and morris's patented egg creams but be careful drinking them too fast will cause a nasty brain freeze it's all enveloped in a feel good intimate atmosphere set in new york city br br director jeff hare proves to be a master craftsman drawing out memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a humanity i was fortunate to see an earlier film by hare the dark and powerful perfect little man starring neal mcdonough minority report as a los angeles man spiraling into madness the visceral grit of perfect and the nostalgic breeze of checking out are a testament to hare's eclecticism and wide ranging talent i'm looking forward to checking out his future work br br i heard checking out lacks a distributor at this point some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd pleasing gem for it's a potential box office titan in the vein of my big fat greek wedding most nobly it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie
