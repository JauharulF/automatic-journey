<START> laughable br br clichÃ©d br br overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing br br remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows aeon flux 2005 is based upon one such show Â a cartoon from the mid 90s Â featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing aeon played by the lovely charlize theron in this adaptation is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line dancer and as deadly as a viper snake she needs to be if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government br br i love science fiction but hate the sudden influx of half assed futuristic dystopian technology overdosed films like the island 2005 and equilibrium 2002 bottom of the pile aeon flux has all the problems that are present in these films but amplified that is there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that matrix 1999 catalyzed the special effects are therefore sensational in aeon flux which earns it a few points but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there br br to make matters worse all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch charlize theron's character aeon flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough chick schtick and it seems as though the director karyn kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next Â should she make her more detached or more emotional she doesn't know let's go both ways imagine you take a shotgun load it chock full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess this is the character of aeon flux br br the film aeon flux puts forward all the ideas in a dystopian society individual vs society nature vs science emotion vs cold reason etc you've seen all of this before and better done at that go read orwell bradbury or or even watch logan's run 1976 or blade runner 1982 anything avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese fest for as long as you can br br 3 10
<START> anyone who has ever doubted ingrid bergman's ability to play comedy need only look to the bells of st mary's ok so she's a nun with tb who's probably in love with fr think what luis bunuel could have done with that but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often in cactus flower she's a starched dentist's nurse walter matthau is the dentist in love with her boss but keeping it up when she's forced to act as his 'wife' in order to hoodwink his mistress don't ask she lets loose and the buttons pop and she's a joy to behold br br the movie itself is a than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit you can see it's three acts it's a french farce it was originally it's taken from the play de by pierre and jean pierre and it hits all the right spots matthau uses his great hang expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer as she was then called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for 'the wife' even though 'the wife' is having a ball hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress
<START> if this movie is coming to a theater near you consider it a threat i was unfortunate enough to see this movie here in tokyo since i'm dutch i was surprised to find a dutch movie playing in a metropole like tokyo is i figured it had to be of special if a dutch movie makes it all the way to japan so i went there with some friends and we were happily telling the theater's staff that we were dutch and that we were so curious about the movie as it turned out this was one of the most infantile silly dumb worst acted with worst spoken english movie i've seen in maybe 10 years and i left the theater trying to avoid the staff because feeling almost responsible for this disaster movie sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was aiming for lola rennt trainspotting kind of like movie instead it was more like macgyver on drugs with outdated music as a score but if i wasn't feeling too annoyed the movie was unintentionally quite hilarious once in a while as it showed holland at its smallest
<START> there is so much not to like about this show it's hard to know where to start unlikeable characters horrible plot lines terrible writing and terrible acting don't even get me started on the obnoxious theme music br br on top of all that the show is out of touch with u s audiences due to the heavy canadian references all throughout it oh say derek will you be going to queens college in the fall how have you bean we should go br br granted other shows are filmed in canada for financial reasons like stargate atlantis but while those shows may have suffered from some annoyances like rodney calling a z p m a zed p m the show didn't focus on life in canada br br mtv is running degrassi another show based on the experiences of the canadian teenager during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time most teens are at school when it airs i'd wager it's for the same reason shows that focus on teenage life in canada don't translate well to a u s audience br br this show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a furnace
<START> personally i didn't really gain a whole lot from the act of seeing with one's own eyes i've noticed a lot of really highly rated reviews on here for the film and i'm kinda surprised maybe i missed something that other reviewers felt moved by but i found the film pretty tedious and basically pointless br br the action of the film is a bunch of autopsy footage that is filmed in an art house style lots of extreme close ups weird editing etc and with no sound or dialogue br br i guess the act of seeing with one's own eyes could be considered a study of human anatomy or maybe if you really wanna dig a little some sort of comment on the fragility of humanity or whatever but i personally found it to be a bunch of semi interesting but ultimately dull autopsy footage if that's your thing then this will be a winner for you as for me i've seen more interesting er footage not a bad film as it isn't really a film in any traditional sense i just found nothing really notable about it 4 10
<START> note i saw i sell the dead at the glasgow international film festival on 20th january 2009 i sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy set in late medieval times and stars dominic monaghan lost lord of the rings ron pearlman hellboy larry fessenden session 9 and angus scrimm phantasm br br the movie opens with grave robber willie fessenden still indignant and being dragged to the guillotine and executed his apprentice and partner in crime arthur blake monaghan is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when father duffy perlman a whiskey swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult pays him a visit with the apparent intention of recording blake's final confession it soon becomes apparent however that duffy main interest lies in the more otherworldly side of blake's exploits most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as monaghan duffy with tales of his macabre career br br initially and blake start out as simple wise cracking body snatchers working in the employ of the ghoulish dr quint scrimm a callous corrupt who uses blackmail as leverage over our two anti heroes and takes a rather unhealthy relish in his work the pair have their first run in with the undead when one evening quint sends them on a mission to a bleak moonlit moor to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously interred at a crossroads apparently according to some ancient custom but there's something different about this corpse this one has been wrapped in of garlic and buried with a stake through it's heart br br following a terrifying encounter not only do they devise a plan to rid themselves of the scheming doctor's machinations but they also uncover a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses and even better money for living specimens of the undead this leads our intrepid duo into the hidden underworld of the ghoul hunting trade where they find themselves going head to head not only with vampires monsters and zombies and one other paranormal entity for which i will not spoil the surprise but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inbred and murderous murphy clan br br i went into i sell the dead expecting a low key mildly distracting low budget chiller i was not prepared for the incredible imagination giddy humour quality acting great dialogue thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes i sell the dead a strong early contender for my horror film of the year br br with the exception of a couple of rough edges the production values are truly fantastic for such a low budget flick it looks like it was made for about 20 million and i was surprised when the director told the audience it was made for significantly less than half of that although he was unwilling to give exact figures as the film was still being sold to distributors the look and tone of the film is a visual comic book somewhere between tim burton and hammer horror with smart little creepshow esquire artwork inserts the plot is wonderfully surreal but the idea of a hidden underworld running parallel to everyday life but which the general populace is either unable or unwilling to believe in is one that actually makes quite good sense within the context of the film br br the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin playing doctor quinn br br conclusion i loved it it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie i struggle to find anything bad to say about it mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line
<START> i'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this this movie is a debauchery of his work i agree with the other commenter this movie was a terrible disappointment i'd give it a zero but am forced to give it a 1 br br the story was weak and it reminded me of the days when i was a young teenager trying to write a movie then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was bad actors family and friends and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made it's really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done if this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn who're struggling this movie made me laugh but for all the wrong reasons by all accounts this was seriously not meant to be a comedy scary movie is a better play on a horror genre this movie just sucks
<START> i went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the second coming boy was i ever wrong bbc are dullards at pacing a movie total idiots at creating suspense fools at building intensity and this movie is no exception to the rule of how much bbc sucks br br ugh the pacing and time wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through the first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours i kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless monotonous drivel would end they wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role because the material is so lazy and sloppily written everything that happens is just to kill time br br out of 155 minutes only 15 minutes are interesting the controversial ending what a shame reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie the preaching the am i god endless blah blah blah ing the dumb as boring miracles ugh br br do not watch this crap
<START> this movie was really interesting it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premiered br br it was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are you aren't if this was made for an american audience it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the bbc did it still is propaganda in some extend no film today with these themes can not be but it dealt with the issue successfully br br a film that should be shown in all terrorism counter terrorism courses but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged a great film in which the bbc took a few risks and unfortunately london does not need a fictional tale any more due to the reality of july 7 2005
<START> i love dogs and the most interesting character in this movie is a golden retriever he is smarter better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters like many other contributors i have not read the book but i doubt that having done so would change my opinion of the movie it is predictable from the first five minutes on no surprises mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teen age boy and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it all in all the movie is a dog but as i said i love dogs and will therefore give this movie a 7 10 rating watch it if it comes on tv rent it if you are bored and nothing else catches your eye but don't buy it unless it is on special
<START> when i first watched this show on cartoon network i found it uninteresting then i read a lot of good messages about this show and i decided to watch it the show was so boring each episode was predictable more this show has no logic girls who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things 99 of episodes start with a monster attacking then mayor he is a real fool he is not funny he is so stupid that i can't imagine how he became a mayor professor yes supposed to be the smartest person in this show but actually he even found no difference between monster and his brother narrator's comments also make this show boring because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending also the animation is very strange everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way also in every this show is giving you some life lessons and it means that it is oriented on little children but if you look closer you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood during their battles
<START> is the kind of formulaic hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall br br i remember murray promoting on larry king's crappy cnn show where he said something like if this movie doesn't become a hit i'll stop making movies or comedies he wasn't being nearly as jovial as one might think he must have felt that was a sure fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen hence a sort of ultimatum live on air to his fans to spend their hard earned money on a dumb elephant comedy the comedy being dumb not the elephant or maybe he simply realized during the shooting or when he saw the final cut what a turkey this was so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding quality go see it it really is good actors are prostitutes inter bred with car salesmen br br is the sort of lousy project that comes from the friends school of comedy their motto if you ever run out of ideas or if you never had any in the first place then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness cuteness a sad substitute for lack of funny gags the other motto friends had was always include pointless dull sentimentality which this movie so predictably ends with when murray rather pathetically says what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant maybe not an elephant but i certainly managed to easily forget this turkey which i saw many years ago i was suddenly reminded of it when i saw a scene from it on tv today hence this equally pointless review br br murray wastes his talent on this turkey disguised as an elephant but he isn't nearly as uninteresting bad as mcconaughey or however that man's name is spelt one would think that m m would have an easy time playing himself i e a hick but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that i could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself it was cringe worthy to round off this nonsense we have that generation x buffoon garofalo in a rather useless role then again everything about is useless br br after which bombed as far as i know murray went on to become more of a serious actor what is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex is it all just about getting awards i e recognition from their peers read votes from their moron colleagues this piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies murray made in the early and mid 90s such as groundhog day quick change mad dog glory kingpin what about bob and ed wood recently we've had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage mediocrities such as hamlet lost in translation you just can't get away from these ultra talented and broken flowers compare those two br br one guy described funny as heck now that's the kind of audience this movie was hoping for shopping malls and trailer parks
<START> may 2nd someone clicked 11 nos and then proceeded to do 15 more on my previous 15 comments almost as funny as this turkey br br may 1st br br as i write this i'm still very much under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller i've ever seen i've got a major case of the giggles but i'll try and calm down it's kind of hard to write when your nose spills snot and the mouth sporadic drool onto the keyboard br br a pair of young women who just returned from a vacation take a ride on a shuttle bus a couple of young guys join them but the bus isn't really a taxi service it's a kidnapping vehicle don't snicker its driver has been part of an organized white slavery gang who snatch young women from airports and they've been doing it for five years don't laugh five years on the same airport without the police or even the fbi ever getting any wind of it no giggling please apparently dozens of women go missing on in the same exact place for years and years and yet no one notices a trend is the fbi that incompetent the world of shuttle seems to consist of three types of people easily blonds dumb comatose invisible fbi agents and omnipotent psychotic gangsters who hate sexy blonds with tattooed br br the driver has barely stayed alive on this one mission and yet he's done this for i repeat five years without being killed or losing one of his limbs stop laughing did i mention that the driver is immortal need i mention it we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna you can stab them bounce them against the walls of a bus repeatedly caress them softly with a hammer prick nine inch nails into their ears hell you could stick a hand grenade into the average hollywood psycho's mouth and he'd still escape with only minor scratches no the driver is not satan or even a minor demon but just a regular hollywood psycho with better survival abilities than the biggest meanest sewer cockroach br br the basic plot outline a guy loses all the fingers on one hand in a silly scene a magical bus that reads and obeys minds the passengers try to escape they fail they get hurt they sulk they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they try to escape they fail they try to escape the manage to snatch the gun from the driver alas they do not kill him because the golden hollywood rule of gandhi like pacifism prohibits them from doing it no giggling one of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang stop laughing he is played by an actor who studied in the rob zombie john travolta school of over acting silly mugging he threatens rape later on one of the gals hits him with a crowbar over the head about a dozen times very hard only seconds later does he regain consciousness yep he survives immortal remember he gets killed a little later no idea how though he is not supposed to be the argue they try to escape one of them escapes alas the psychos are just far too god like in their powers not to re capture their prey the game starts all over again the passengers try to escape they fail they sulk they stare into the void they get hurt they try to escape they fail they get hurt br br you get the picture br br frankly i believe that a drugged heavily disorientated inebriated snail would have escaped these captors with ease there were so many opportunities at one point these bumbling psychos remember five years even send one of the into a grocery store she leaves a message to the police however yeah you guessed it this fictional fairy tale u s city has no police br br and just as you thought the movie couldn't get any dumber not even if luc and brian de palma joined forces to lend a hand with the script it does the girls are kidnapped in order to be sent to some remote island and this is achieved by transporting them as cargo apparently this fictional america has no fbi no police and no border customs either it does however have immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners one blond had her chance to kill the driver and yet she failed how is it that victims in these dumb thrillers never try to finish off their immortal adversaries once they have them down on the floor and injured i guess i answered that one myself they're immortal so why bother trying she must have thought br br so why was one blond gassed to death and the other one boxed and shipped alive complete with a kitty litter box and the funniest photograph since demi moore's primary school pictures could it be the tattoo i think they killed the prettier one but that's just me was her tattoo that ugly br br could it be that i don't care why should i search for logic in a movie made by imbeciles for imbeciles besides how can i even think straight when i'm laughing so hard half the time br br naturally this being a 21st century horror thriller the mobile phone doesn't work perhaps this invincible gang control not only the fbi the police and the customs but satellites in space too br br do i have to spell it out there are far easier ways to kidnap people and far more intelligent people who should be making movies give an idiot a camera and he'll lay an egg every single time that sort of answers the eternal riddle of which came first the egg or the bird brained director
<START> the first film i saw from these people was children of the grave and when i heard that this one was coming on i thought it would be good to watch mostly because waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted this documentary film was awful there was too much fake commentary from the producers directors camera men they needed to keep their faces out of this film waverly has been rumored to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary the paranormal proof was horrible and almost non existent i have heard better from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom they tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary not the stories not the blurry too dark to see anything videos not the pictures not the tape recordings children of the grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor the only reason i am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative learning about how the hospital came about the daily life there and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this 2hr piece of crap
<START> this movie is pathetic in every way possible bad acting horrible script was there one terrible editing lousy cinematography cheap humor just plain horrible br br i had seen 'the a couple weeks before this movie and i thought it was a dead ringer for worst movie of the year then i saw 'the and suddenly 'the didn't seem so bad at all br br bad bad bad excruciatingly bad
