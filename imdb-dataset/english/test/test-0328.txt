<START> i don't pretend to be a huge asterix fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad garret as and sean astin as especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the contradicting name endings all the viking names end in af while all the names of course end in ix with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichÃ©s br br the plot is this the viking chief is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied so he consults his wise man whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and tells him that fear lends the villagers wings taking this literally believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the champion of fear an expedition that of course leads him to the village where asterix and live br br the pair are currently very frustrated chief cowardly pacifist nephew has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when unwittingly confesses to being afraid of everything in the presence of the brainless viking olaf he is believed to be the champion of fear and is kidnapped asterix and are sent by to go rescue before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home br br ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichÃ©s and at times defective dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it wasn't true to the comic
<START> arthur miller certainly knows his stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the united states in the 20th century than any other writer i can think of br br focus based on one of his novels is no exception br br william h macy and laura dern give fantastic performances here emotionally bruising but ultimately rewarding this movie is excellent
<START> after watching john preform this one of a kind show i had to share it was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child i like the fact that with every character he became you could picture what they looked like it is more entertaining when you can understand the individual freak is what real stand up should be john is real talent
<START> dear movie director br br in the future when trying to create a sense of urgency it might be best to have your hero run instead of jog shuffle especially if you're trying to reinforce a time line for example if you're trying to convince the audience that the bad guy really will kill the hostage if the hero doesn't find her it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it may actually happen let's face it though making a good movie obviously wasn't your goal your goal was to pump out some garbage that will make more money than it cost otherwise you might have hired some actors br br sincerely bored viewer br br this is the worst movie i've seen in a long time i can't say that it's the worst ever because i was able to finish it it was bad bad bad though dude where's my refund
<START> 10 10 br br plot discussion br br this is one of the best movies ever made and i am not saying that because i am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation those who dislike the film because they don't understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don't understand it i don't view this movie as very allegorical to me it is a story with a beginning middle and end people become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes i feel they fail to realize that the comes from a chopped up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory because of the limitation of length i will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts br br the general plot diane moves to l a after jitterbug contest to get into acting at an audition she meets camilla with whom she falls in love diane becomes enraged with jealousy since camilla sleeps with other men and women diane discovers the other man the director at a film shoot and discovers the other woman a random blond at the engagement party for camilla and the director motivated by her rage and possessiveness diane hires a hit man to kill camilla after that is done she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to diane is then awakened in her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done br br the significance of the fantasy the film starts out after the credits with a 1st person p o v shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness this is where diane's fantasy starts the accident is there as an excuse for her to bring back her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life she depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was in the meantime she acts like everything is like in the movies because she has an escapist personality she also in a sense kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named betty at a diner the story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and convinces herself that he was forced to choose camilla it was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party camilla in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party she hated her so much that she turned her into camilla and made the ultimate antagonist she then took the real camilla and turned her into a perfect submissive out of the movies girlfriend and used rita hayworth as an inspiration she also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of camilla her fantasy world unfortunately for her was a search for diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality the first reminder was club which that there is no band and the instruments you hear are not really there this is a metaphor for the fantasy she begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings the other reminder is the blue box actually the blue box is not the reminder itself more of a pandora's box really but the blue key that opens the box the blue key reminds her of the actual death of camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done along with having love this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived br br this is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream it is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message it is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully br br however ultimately this is all my opinion i may be way off or it may not be intended to mean any one thing there are many who disagree with me great afterall why does it have to mean anything why can't it just be a statement in itself what if coherent sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression peter greenaway for example has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as i would argue that if you want to write narratives be an author be a novelist don't be a film maker because i believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative and where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation there is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it i didn't understand it so mulholland dr story or not affects the viewers harasses them drags them awes them lulls them the way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing it never gets old it never loses its luster its visuals are always effective and beautiful it is cinematic perfection no matter what enjoy
<START> this movie pops up now and again on the abc in australia at about 3 am in the morning br br it starts off with the scene of a bus crash in london br br the films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses plus the lapsed photography of big ben winding back to symbolise what events occurred thirteen hours ago up until the bus crash br br it took me a while to understand it but it was enjoyable nonetheless br br if sean cunningham and quentin tarrantino got together and made a film this may be the result due to the flashbacks and small stories tying in and deaths br br i am unsure of the main characters as it has been a while since i have seen it but a rare gem indeed
<START> roy du is not totally original as it is counter piece to previous movie andra still the movie has aura of total originality some conventions of movie making are still thrown away most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it the shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions w g comes to mind in literature with same technique because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes there is a story and isn't it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind this movie is positive it is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all great movie
<START> atoll k aka utopia is one of hollywood's saddest swan songs filmed in france the land that loves lewis jerry in 1950 and released the following year after a five year the boys are in truly terrible shape physically however they aren't in nearly as bad a shape as the script br br this movie is one of the un funniest comedies ever filmed br br it's painful to see this legendary team the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures the twosome that made the devil's brother 1933 the music box 1932 pack up your troubles also 1932 babes in toyland 1934 bonnie scotland 1935 flying deuces 1939 and so many more gut wrenching laugh til you choke classic comedies in a film such as this br br but fighters and ballplayers do it all the time they stay in the game one season or one fight too many in this case while is morbidly fascinating to see laurel hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers they too stuck around for one too many
<START> this film should have been much better than it was christopher eccleston is an excellent actor but even he couldn't rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister's death spoiler warning in effect the truth is that the older sister played by diaz is just a spoilt selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs not much of a twist and not that interesting either the film is also with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing all in all this is definitely worth missing not to be recommended
<START> a movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun romantic and easy going entertainment instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable br br spoiler br br when the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen danner and mcewan you know you're in trouble but those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people br br end of spoiler br br capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful like i said above the theme seems to be repression and i understand that is an element of life and love but i don't want to see a movie about it either at least not this one br br i can't recommend this at all despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves
<START> would be an extremely above average comic book vampire hunter action horror if it weren't for two minor flaws 1 i loved seeing the all but invincible blade snipes do his slicing and dicing but the whole yes fist punch was literally a letdown 2 bad no make that horrible cgi Â even for 1998 standards this is mainly in the last third but some sprinkled throughout okay despite those minor i really enjoyed this movie all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'matrix' rip off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior so maybe 'the matrix' copied 'blade ' at any rate it's a very movie for multiple genre loving audiences comic book geeks action fanatics and horror vampire lovers so we have blade half man half vampire or day walker and his accomplish a la batman and alfred battling the undead who apparently almost out number humans who knew in a rare act of humanity blade's more of an antihero our sword ninja vamp rescues a newly infected coincidentally blood specialist doctor meanwhile trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants you guessed it supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it it's not the most original concept if you read what i just wrote but still highly enjoyable you will want to see blade succeed you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms and you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1 2 3 of a comic book introduction movie still watch this without trying to go too deep such as vampire 1000 suntan lotion really what about the scalp wouldn't that still burn just like the money they burn for weapons uh okay i am going too deep once again sit back and enjoy the techno charged fun ride
<START> a better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of bosnia some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary woody harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of bosnia if one expects a great and gripping movie welcome will be a disappointment
<START> this home movie is basically scandalously rubbish but you have to give them 3 10 for trying the blood is rubbish but the granny that kills them is quite funny and i think the concept is good and make up is ok for a home movie however thank god it was only 55 minutes long and the twist at the end is quite literally fight club as in almost as trash as the film just read this comment don't watch the film
<START> the clever marketeer is he is jess franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like mario bava's ultimately sensational danger franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film as he could freely insert as much sleaze kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to and he partially understood this very well as the girl from rio revolves on a man hating organization led by a funky dressed lesbo that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves unfortunately for them at least the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss played by george sanders all the right ingredients are well presented yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie the plot is rich on imagination but seemingly only on paper as the action is quite tame the film is also very colorful but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex there's a bit of nudity sure but too few according to normal franco standards all the characters are sick in the head so the least i expected or hoped for were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members particularly the veteran actor george sanders village of the damned psychomania is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production too bad even he can't save the girl from rio from being a huge letdown a legendary euro smut filmmaker like jess franco could and should have done more with this concept shame shame shame
<START> aimless teens on summer break in a small ohio town can't find any meaningful ways to fill their time some consider driving to chicago others are content to drink and bully their peers in a random act of alcohol fueled arrogance the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book the handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces a night or two later one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed he turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peers br br demon summer is an amateur production with a microscopic budget the production values are low but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed the acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay on the positive side the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards despite this the gore is minimal makeup effects aside there is little going for this film even for die hard gore hounds not recommended
