<START> generally political messages are done on television so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness watch to your hearts content most people go to the movies to be entertained not sold some poppycock political nonsense the hook here is the big name cast unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere the two best performances chris cooper and richard dreyfus have minimal screen time in short silver city is to be avoided as entertainment it is nothing more than a non documentary rambling political expose on illegal immigration pollution and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen merk
<START> perhaps it's about time we declare 2007 to be the international year of the cinematic crocodile the ridiculous primeval came first about a croc named gustave ruling the swamps in burundi then there was lake placid 2 a low profiled and made for tv sequel to a forgettable original thirdly there's this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of aussie horror and finally i have yet to see the promising rogue the last one is likely to be the best considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg mclean wolf creek black water certainly isn't a complete waste of time and film but it's another pretty pointless survival flick that confuses real life agony with horror pardon my bluntness especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas it doesn't take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile their little boat and devours the guide grace lee and adam barely manage to escape the reptile's hungry teeth by climbing up a tree even though he remains unseen most of the time the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive yes it does sound an awful lot like the plot of open water indeed replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable aussie swamp and there you have it oh well black water at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster it has to be said the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water the three headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time the based on true events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions like limited images of the fantastic filming locations dialogs and amiable character drawings
<START> the figure of empress elizabeth of austria 1837 1898 is indeed mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka 1950s where beauty gentleness sweetness but also history are ever present this was the sissi perhaps myth for some however a powerful portrayal the spirit of the grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and influenced much those films simply they did have a soul however jean daniel film though made 50 years later appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life it seems to be an attempt to show something different to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness yet it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much let me analyze that in more details br br september 1898 sissi embarks at the port of geneva accompanied by her court maid she goes to visit dr mayer whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in life yet these moments are presented and therefore someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused much attention is drawn on bad marriage with the emperor franz josef the scene of her wedding night is a failure no one treated an empress like that i mean undressing and payment the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically however the points that her views differ from the rest of the are not the true ones where is her desire for peace where is her love to her nation where is her charity sissi appears to be rather very elegant modern liberal from the 21st century's point of view she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film once women will wear trousers is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie sissi detests monarchy which is the film's noticeable criticism towards austrian empire moreover she partly accepts anarchist movements and to my very surprise she blames her husband emperor franz josef for the death of rudolph their son where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling relation with sophie the mother in law is better shown however the scene of sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of clichÃ© br br sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi she generally does not suit to the role she looks more like a femme fa tale than a tragic empress her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress malik is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances in general yet stephane does no special job as sophie you simply don't get the impression of why she detests sissi she did despise her for the sake of young age while crowned for the sake of her behavior lifestyle and her believes partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough but the greatest mistake is i think julien hans as was a count with pride honor patriotism here he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale the accurate choice is ivanova as catherine she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures but unfortunately her role does not require much time on screen br br a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie it does not appear to be how it really was however the moment is good from the perspective the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment that is how she must have felt about it that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on but these moments are rare br br in sum it's not a good film it distorts a very eminent historical figure a significant historical time it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative charm is gone grandeur is gone and history is ignored not very worth seeking out 3 10
<START> the title is a misnomer the movie depicts barely one year of the so called marquis twas a hard time for him 'cause he was threatened by the guillotine the quiet joys of the reign of terror br br historically speaking the background is rather sketchy the fÃªte de re supreme failed attempt to create a secular religion his downfall a heaven sent opportunity for showing doctor sinister machine at work full speed br br as far as sade is concerned it's a downright mediocre affair he's waiting in a former nunnery with other nobles a golden cage if you compare it to say marie or scientist fates and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death love and other trivia there's the obligatory daring scene but you've got to be patient because it's a long time before it comes on the screen and anyway by today's standards can we call that risquÃ© de sade which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of the imdb is at least entertaining and keir dullea was a more credible marquis than the aging auteuil and it featured john huston
<START> though it's better than most made for tv movies buried alive is nothing more than a run of the mill revenge tale there are so many plot holes in this one it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re writes the ending has a nice twist to it but it's hardly believable br br the acting by jennifer jason leigh is terrific as always but tim matheson hams it up with cheesy one liners that reminds one of jack nicholson in the shining don't bother with this one
<START> my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment this was one such movie kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more in depth review the story has some old horror actor legend dying i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price without being likable and classy he commits murders and dies but what is this is the movie over already no as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing seemed to have a good premise but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire
<START> thank god for dvr and the high speed of it's fast forward even with that i couldn't sit through any more of that travesty when they came across the old indian asking for beans i gave up and erased it is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights how about some old classics instead the idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods what more can i say it was so awful that i don't think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it but it looks like one more line will do it save your time let alone your money on this dog of a film
<START> postwar england the dawn of the atomic age yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the br br 1940's free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and br br hormones of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots br br maintain character interest ala gregory's girl and plenty br br of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has br br ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see
<START> how pointless hideous characters and boring film saved by brief sex scenes mad witch gorgeous desert island and brooks body the plot is tenuous the characters are shallow and unlikeable having said that i did manage to watch it all mainly because i was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end the film was well shot well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways disappointing really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum it would be better to spend the time watching another film
<START> tumbling doll of flesh aka and psycho the snuff reels this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back it's never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd r which i'm quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch
<START> minor spoilers follow but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the dvd br br held together by a wonderful central performance from renÃ©e zellweger nurse betty is a dark yet deceptively good natured comedy br br suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder already troubled and desperately unhappy waitress betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long lost fiancÃ© and sets off from kansas to hollywood to find him br br instead of making jokes at the expense of betty's mental state writer john c richards is very sympathetic with zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless crucially she's never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable even greg kinnear as the object of her deluded affections may be an egotistical blinkered arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that she's merely a quirky wannabe actress with bags of talent rather than an insane stalker br br the farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend on the same place in this instance betty's house at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here even if the shift in tone is unfortunate br br zellweger is ably supported by kinnear and morgan freeman both doing solid work and it's especially pleasing to see chris rock show restraint in his earlier scenes br br not nearly as cruel as you might expect and not at all mean spirited nurse betty while far from being a laugh riot is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more by the lead actress
<START> bad a lot a crap it copied simone also a bad movie them flips when loretta modern sang was lame that internet scenes made it worse and roscoe loves a hologram thats plain stupid i give 0 stars because they copied the plot was stupid the whole movie was thumbs down all the way
<START> br br horror movie time japanese style spiral was a total from start to finish a fun at that but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror the story is difficult to summarize succinctly a carefree normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals the spirals are everywhere in the air clouds dirt and everyday objects the spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them oh another thing people are randomly turning into snails why who knows or cares people are turning into snails that's enough for me this wasn't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do prefers to creep and crawl like a snail might rather than to jolt a favorite scene a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post across the sheets over the pillow and into her sleeping ear i cringed and curled my toes has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well for example a man is obsessed w spirals he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins he commits spiral suicide inside the washer the last shot we see of him is w his body all rubber like a human flesh spiral w a single eye blinking in the middle of the washer a bizarre image has a blatant slant to it which adds to its charm and fun i love horror movies like this it's not about killing a la slasher films it's about a force of evil the spirals taking over you and trying to kill you force you to kill others films like prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that
