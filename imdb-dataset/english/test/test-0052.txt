<START> this is the worst italian movie ever quite possibly the worst movie of all time joe d'amato is of course no cinematic genius but many of his movies are interesting and watchable unfortunatly this is not one of them its cheesy and boring waaaaay boring if you want a movie to mst3k get troll 2 if you want a movie to put someone into a coma get deep blood
<START> a dull stroll through the banalities of mormon utterly un funny a testament to the widely held theory that in order for bathroom humor to be funny it must necessarily be vulgar it also bolsters the claim that a close relationship with jesus makes you not funny more propaganda than film don't worry about any touchy social issues coming up at the dinner table after this one the saving grace of this movie is its accurate portrayal of young mormon females as particularly attractive oh well its your 7 50
<START> i have heard that was compared to memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short term memory loss well that's like comparing the silence of the lambs and friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people they couldn't be further apart in ideas br br deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss he is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office in comes a temp who also gets involved with him and may may not use him for sex needless to say he has a lot of on screen sex br br wait there's more there's a boy who runs into the troubled amnesia male and it's obvious there's more to this boy just bumping into him and there's a notebook the man keeps to try and remember important clues br br i admit i am not one for foreign made films i don't mind reading the subtitles but i do mind that sometimes that takes away from one of my favorite aspects of a film great dialogue since they have to translate or i wouldn't be able to understand for the most part i truly believe they simplify what the characters have to say this movie was no exception the dialogue was just well blah br br as for the story it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes weird yes but then again i don't live in france so i am not as familiar with their likes dislike or lifestyles such as i guess it's acceptable for a father to lie with and frolic in the buff with his son on the beach Â that must be a cultural thing thankfully it wasn't two hours of time invested in watching this man regain his past and progressively move forward to his cure for when the secret is learned i was like really well okay then br br i can only recommend for somewhat decent acting good looking folks and soft porn sexual situations like every 2 4 minutes however if you're not into that sort of scene i would wholeheartedly skip this slow moving and memory regaining film
<START> when you watch low budget horror movies as much as i do you get to where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie as each film maker adds his own flavor to the cheese such is the case with jack o when i watched this truly awful movie i was left with the undeniable feeling that fred olen ray was involved maybe not as director but in some fashion and as i researched i found that i was correct only fred and a of others could write something this pathetic and this movie just reeked of fred olen ray unless you like fred olen ray and god only knows why anyone would avoid this movie if you're going to rent an olen ray pic rent hollywood chainsaw hookers it's the only bright shining star in olen ray's dark cheesey universe of terrible movies
<START> i won't bore you with story and plot lines as they have been presented many times already on this page soÂ it's been along time coming since i have seen such a film beautiful elegant and restrained with a narrative pace to match a film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichÃ©d plots the beautifully subdued photography saturated in rich luxurious colors and for lack of better words each frame is filled with an air of tension the settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured there always seems to be a key prop light fixture or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world br br the acting reminds me of the the bicycle thief not the style but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft there is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters the relationship the feelings and situation of the two lovers the dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie is imbued with meaning speaking of meaning the soundtrack is infectious used here it becomes a story telling device and although the film is of chinese origins even a song sung in spanish by nat king cole imparts the film with subtle meaning the orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive but the repetition is what makes it comfortable it is used in conjunction with the story and not just a means to put music to action or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point br br i would not recommend this film to anybody i fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story but i would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world i must say that i was completely taken by this film and continued to watch it night after night the story takes time to present itself and bears repeated viewings as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation a very beautiful movie
<START> set in the lethal panther 2 is a dreary early 90s martial arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife a rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action but whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs gun fights and explosions the quality is just not there the endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through br br the usually impressive is totally wasted with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire work the ballistic action scenes are an unimpressive mixture of 'slow motion flying through the air whilst heroics crazy vehicle stunts and endless bad guys lining up to be shot br br with so many better examples of the 'girls and genre now available on dvd i suggest that you leave this one well alone unless like me you'll endure pretty much any old rubbish in order to be a completist
<START> downhill racer is essentially a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences although there is a story here robert redford's character a skier trying to make the u s olympic team is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all gene hackman in an early performance adds nicely but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off and it wouldn't make much of a difference
<START> i remember seeing this movie back when it was released and i still remember the 'buzz' i felt when i left the cinema everything about this movie is magnificent the music is top notch and i still play the soundtrack after all these years br br i have seen this movie so many times and yet i still get yearnings to watch it again and again nicholas cage was great and whenever i see cameron dye in anything nowadays i always associate him with this movie it is too bad the rest of the cast didn't go on to greater things but maybe that is part of this film's charm br br i won't do a film school critique as i am sure all the analysts out there can find fault if they wanted to but what i will say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life over 20 years later the movie 'feels' great and stirs up emotions when you watch it well it did for me and i cannot recommend it highly enough for anybody who has not yet seen it br br you either 'get' the movie or you don't those of you who 'get it' will be rewarded with a unique movie experience
<START> i watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in beach qld australia i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most don't bother to browse br br to my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection i still do not have it but will one day br br i like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy the semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effect br br i have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre with nothing but praise it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come br br i fully recommend this film but only to those that are into this type br br this comment and the one from la ca can assist you when choosing to watch this film the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation
<START> shohei black rain was released in 1989 just at the onset of the aids epidemic a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of hiroshima radiation victims an added poignancy the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one based on a novel by who gathered information from interviews and the diaries of real life bomb victims the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion it is a horrifying vision but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity br br the film begins in hiroshima on august 6 1945 as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history survivors must somehow restart their lives unaware of the devastating after effects filmed in high contrast black and white the story centers around tanaka a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives in hiroshima imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us a young boy with skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of debris a mother is in torment as she rocks the blackened body of her child br br when the family returns to their rural home life is forever changed she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle kazuo kitamura and aunt pretending that there is only business as usual the family denies that the bomb has affected she forgot how hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed everyone forgot it they forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival i'm sick of it says a friend kobayashi internalizes the tragedy feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being contaminated br br when her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her health even though has copied her diary to prove that she wasn't directly exposed to the bomb the only suitor she feels comfortable with is another damaged man who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine at the end the beauty of life shows itself ever so fleetingly when goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life the king jumping in the water playfully as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war human beings learn nothing says they strangle themselves unjust peace is better than a war of justice why can't they see black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly
<START> okay so it was never going to change the world and it bombed at the box office but honky tonk freeway is one of those films i fell in love with as a child the bbc showed it a few times during the 1980s and i happened to have a high quality vhs tape in the machine lucky that and watched endlessly i watched the dvd last night and sadly time has not been kind to this would be blockbuster either that or i've just grown out of this kind of broad dopey humour come on when schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close ups of novelty underpants with slogans what can you say about the cast or screenplay br br certainly it's ambitious interesting unusual and sprawling but it's never once laugh out loud funny i'd describe it as a children's film with some 'adult' overtones you can safely let your youngsters watch this despite the 15 certificate they won't get the drug references so don't worry about it i had a pleasant surprise when i realized i'd forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song writing truck driver's 'everybody's going faster song were not to mention the town of patriotic anthem the whole cast give commendable performances the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly and there's a real time capsule feeling about the fashions the cars the gadgets especially the dashboard mounted drum machine the interiors and the pop culture references i was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone i'm oj simpson particularly now simpson's legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements the snag is there's almost no plot to speak of it's way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs i wish i'd left this one as a pleasant memory
<START> this is one of the best movies i have seen in years i took me to a new time and place it was as though i was right there with ray through his many trials and triumphs jamie foxx transformed himself into ray during the movie he was ray also kerry washington sharon robinson and regina king were superb the movie was well cast and directed the music was fantastic br br i've seen the movie four 4 times with different people and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time i will buy the dvd as soon as it is released this is a movie that will viewed over and over for years to come br br thank you for a great experience
<START> it was poorly shot looks like a rush job last minute casting is obvious writing is very weak good for stage not film i feel bad for andrew mccarthy he's a very good actor who has not been getting good roles lately this role was not for him maybe glad it has been picked up yet on the festival circuit this film shall stay

<START> may contain spoilers sadly lou last film has the distinction of being slightly better than abbott last movie together dance with me henry this movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire dorothy is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable you can't blame lou costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light in my opinion lou costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the irs if you look at the last 3 4 abbott costello movies you can notice the magic was gone check out dance with me henry now that's a painful movie to watch
