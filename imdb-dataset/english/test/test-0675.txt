<START> adapted from sam shepard's play this movie retains many play like elements such as a relatively fixed setting a roadside 50's motel in the southwest and extensive intriguing dialogues a woman may is hounded by a man eddie played by sam shepard she tries to hide from him in the out of the way motel but he finds her the film explores the history of their relationship mainly from their childhoods that has led them to this point it's very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events out of their control we mainly watch them fight make up fight make up and so on one image that stands out in my mind is of eddie hauling may over his shoulder kicking and screaming taking her somewhere she doesn't want to go br br the soundtrack is also perfect soulful country with vocals by a lesser known artist sandy rogers she has this country doll voice that almost at some points in the album this is the kind of movie that will stay lodged in some part of your brain soul in other words go see it
<START> arguably the most disgusting thing to come out of australia since predictably distasteful comedy with barry humphries in a dual role as boozy australian diplomat les patterson and undercover agent dame edna so many bodily function gags that even the farrelly brothers would have been sick and several gross out moments especially the effects of the horrible h e l p virus only for fans of extreme toilet humor oh and thatÂ´s the neverending story ii not the mad max george miller who directed Â½ br br
<START> there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors back in the late 80's and early 90's when his name was attached to several great films like the lost boys and falling down he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood then came the stupid batman sequels unfortunately and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumacher's hands both 8mm and phone booth could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of the number 23 should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie literally from start to finish the number 23 desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichÃ©s from the big book of cinema history including heavy voiced narration flashbacks disorderly structure characters with multiple personalities numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings nothing helps however simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast crew as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open minded regarding the insane theories this still remains a movie about a two digit number and two digit numbers aren't scary walter sparrow jim carrey in a rare non comical role is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23 walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book's protagonist a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life i did some research on google and wikipedia and apparently this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number well that's just Â crazy but hey i'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears regardless of how demented they are and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out and out berserk enigma the number 23 is not suspenseful in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make up effects and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life all cast members perform below their normal capacities but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs virginia madsen in a relatively big production again definitely not recommended in case you're looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun but endurable and not entirely without merit
<START> when the new outer limits first started the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging as the series began to wind down most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value the six episodes here reflect the very best and worst of the series br br since the outer limits always preaches a moral i would like to offer my own starting with the most entertaining to the flops br br 1 afterlife as an institution the u s a military industrial complex is both evil and paranoid not to mention plain stupid however individuals with great integrity do serve our country and they will obey their conscience even at a mind boggling cost in the end the aliens don't need to say a word those without a conscience are fools who are to be held in utter contempt br br a truly subversive episode one that should be shown on prime time television for all to see this might be a revelation for some but folks without a conscience should not be allowed to serve in our military nor do the ends justify the means br br 2 relativity theory a good person may be forced to make a split second decision between good or evil in order to save the lives of defenseless intelligent beings and at great cost to one's self what makes this decision all the more difficult is the stark choice being marooned with exotic alien strangers who you can't even communicate with except through gestures or going along with a group of people you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers even if they are ruthless and devoid of compassion br br this episode is brilliant what fuels this depravity is good old fashioned greed this episode is one of the most scathing of capitalism corporations and raping the environment i have ever seen in my lifetime unlike real life justice here is served and swiftly br br one of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate thug said something to the effect we did the same thing in the amazon rainforest war alluding to the killing of amazonian indians who were attempting to protect their rain forests from being strip mined as justification for killing again literally in the name of the survival of the fittest something darwin never meant to be taken literally br br 3 alien shop tremendous power can be used for good even from an exotic alien this power can be used to heal instead of destroy mere mortals can learn from their mistakes even a criminal can see the light if given enough opportunity to do so br br sometimes it takes strong medicine but we all can wake up and change our self destructive ways br br 4 the an alien can be a christ like figure in the distant future slavery can be justified once again in the name of expediency basically good people can be corrupted sometimes a person needs to be experience great shame in order to see the evil he she is committing children are closer to the truth than adults those with political power have tremendous responsibility another work of genius as a species do human beings learn from history br br flop number 1 quality of mercy loose lips sinks ships when in war kindly keep your mouth shut about important military plans gee did i really need to watch an hour long soap opera in order to figure this out i wonder did the makers of the outer limits run out of ideas or did corporate pull the plug dark and ugly serving no purpose but despair br br flop number 2 beyond the veil so bad there is no moral but this when locked up in a mental hospital use some common sense please this episode is so bad it disgusts what an x files rip off don't waste your time on this one you'll thank me later br br it's a sad commentary that the outer limits went down the tubes toward the end of its run subversive episodes like the first four could not last forever it was a miracle they were made at all hopefully someday other brave souls will follow the subversive outer limits tradition into new territory br br if you happen to be such a daring person a good place to start is with one unique book anatomy of wonder a critical guide to science fiction edited by neil barron as far as i'm concerned the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject
<START> means take up and read which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film br br von stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of tobias wolff's 1995 new yorker article of the same name the incredible performance by tom noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing sound design cinematography and directing are truly inspired the nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle clever and make the film cinematically more dynamic it's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again br br watch out for this young director he's going places
<START> the scriptwriters directors and actors have lost sight of the cornerstone of a good story the concept of suspension of disbelief in volcano the concept goes up in smoke almost as quickly as the city contrary to earlier commentators i much preferred dantes peak amongst the 97 vintage of volcano movies
<START> film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living only living staying alive in a cruel world a nightmare world we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else they the children of the movie are desensitized they are more than desensitized by what is around them they see sex as an act like they are watching a tv program when the one boy is with the hooker pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare no feeling he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away a human film with human relations and moral judgement in a ugly scared cruel world reminds us that life is not fair but you can still have a human connection
<START> this is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant that really is if you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point you could describe as manipulative but what if it is really serious that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered but what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly wouldn't you fight for it at least i think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness and it reminds me of the fact how i as a man react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of and don't look further at the person she is or might be this movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect trust feeling manipulated and so on how do i now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact what i think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that ettore scola made it absolutely believable that giorgio falls in love with
<START> if a joke doesn't offend anybody it isn't funny br br the cartoons are offensive no doubt about it so is rap music get over it i suspect that any sane black person will find the cartoons hilarious and that the people who are offended by them white people who still think black's need their patronizing protection against racist humor br br seriously the cartoons are funny it saddens me that not because anybody is really offended but because somebody might just might be offended i can't buy cartoons or the african queen or song of the south on dvd
<START> che is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film it takes a serious subject and presents it like the cliff notes version or classic comics because there isn't much emotion or a proper narrative just episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid true stories relayed by a variety of br br this is a deservedly derided film as it is poorly written and acted however what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext instead of che guevarra and fidel castro working towards a communist cuba they seem to be more of a gay couple with che behaving coy and aloof and fidel as the ardent suitor again and again the film abounds with great lines such as when fidel implores che cuba needs you i need you i am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it i am very surprised that the other reviewers didn't point this out however if you remember this when you watch the film it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier br br a final note in recent years che has been very chic even a fashion statement with hoards of brain dead teens who have no idea who he was wearing shirts emblazoned with his face considering he was a cold blooded killer and nihilist an odd combination for a doctor this new reverence for the man is gross what will they do next put hitler or dr on t shirts and posters even communists with should be appalled by the bloodshed guevara was responsible for and i find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance br br considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was it does nothing to further the message that guevara was no hero i would love to see a realistic film done of his life with the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren't apparently created by chimps
<START> so i was completely in love with this movie gaga for it even with all its plot twists but the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in tim and kyle while the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two and their sexual experimentation confusion he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers although the subject isn't brought up in the film and left unexplained and unaccounted for i just thought that it was in bad taste and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse oops we've created a taboo now let's not address the situation because that wouldn't really be p c otherwise a spectacular film
<START> this is what movies should aspire to funny without being totally stupid a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs biting without resorting to 'f every line i've been seeing justin long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years i figured with the right role he could break out mac commercials not withstanding this film just might put him on a fast track to the a list the rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly this is an excellent little film with a nice message but you don't need to buy the message to have a good time lewis black is as usual hilarious and blake lively is a fresh faced beauty br br take a couple hours and see this film they will not have been wasted
<START> upon writing this review i have difficulty trying to think of what to write about nothing much happens in this film the storyline is a south asian woman who falls for an english londoner the problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak at the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother and it just escalates from there the problem is that this movie is very predictable as soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard it drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long this is more of a chick flick than anything else so if you're male i do not recommend this film to you
<START> after a while i realized it was just my iq slowly dropping frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one and i mean no one is even trying i rooted for the dorky hero to die inside that trashcan how did he even manage to fit in there anyway traci lords the queen of b movies was horribly unfunny and ripped me and my friends off by not showing her boobs a single time br br the characters though i use that term loosely are people so exaggerated and one dimensional they might as well have used cardboard cutouts the jokes i use this term loosely as well are simply hilarious a guy's fart causes an earthquake our hero gets a butt by traci lords oh god i can't breathe the blind guy uses the f word repeatedly this is too much br br say what you want about the acting but i thought adam did a pretty good job at playing a mentally challenged apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs i think i counted three maybe four pairs throughout the entire film scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time that's five minutes worth watching out of 83 minutes of unfunny trash don't watch this watch barb wire with pamela anderson at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that trashy flick r 26
<START> book of revelations starts very well daniel an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped abused and sexually raped by three masked women br br after that nothing else really happens there is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic he quits dancing has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman br br i have seen a good share of art house movies but this has something missing in it br br the main leads are fine but some characters does not seems to be completely defined
