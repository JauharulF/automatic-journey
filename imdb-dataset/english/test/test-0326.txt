<START> after the mysterious death of an old friend a group of teenagers find themselves in the possession of stay alive a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of known as the blood countess the group begins to play the grisly game and soon they are murdered one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game as the line between the game world and the reality disappears our heroes must find a way to defeat vicious blood countess stay alive is an incredibly poor teen slasher flick without any iota of suspense writer director william brent bell doesn't have the damn clue how to make a watchable horror movie the jump scares are irritating the blood gore level is almost non existent and the story doesn't make sense the dialogue is utterly bad and the acting of all involved is embarrassing stay alive is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006 stay away from this stinking turd
<START> with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made de oro seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider this can be pretty annoying br br symbols and references to art and popular culture abound the movie alludes to the work of salvador luis buÃ±uel and the in general a certain infatuation with baths seems to point to ready what's more the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of julio iglesias but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital impetuous boorish vulgarity of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time how all the really pretty women run after him the main character i mean is slightly disconcerting br br the movie has three parts it starts in the spanish enclave of in africa where benito the main character does his military service apparently in the corps of engineers then it moves on to the resort town of in where benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper of the place and become a howard for the last part a defeated benito moves to miami florida presumably in order to start a life but the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic it must be said that javier bardem acquits himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and deflated br br i purchased this movie because i am interested in and is a kind of a special place in this aspect de oro satisfied me only partially in jess franco's she killed in ecstasy 1970 this specific location was used in a more rewarding way
<START> the short film which got gaspar noe on the movie map introducing us to his horrific but thoroughly interesting character the butcher played brilliantly by phillipe noe's direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films showing he was carving his own voice and style from the beginning his sudden cutting along with harsh loud noise skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to disconcert the viewer and it certainly works also he is not afraid of showing violence as viewers of irreversible will know here the violence is equally powerful and in the sequel seul contre tous it is almost unbearable br br the film opens with a horse being killed it is shot in the head and we watch it writhe on the floor its pool of blood flowing out we then see a human birth in all its bloody glory the daughter of the butcher he was orphaned in wwii and has grown up hating the world and everyone and everything in it he serves his customers but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts he wants them all dead his daughter lenoir who would also reprise her role six years later is the only thing he cares about and we watch them grow older together she is however mute and the subject of bullying and toying the butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etc but this is explored more in the next film when she is attacked by a man the butcher explodes with rage stabbing an innocent man in the mouth he goes to prison taken from the only things he wants his shop and daughter in the short 40 minutes we see all this and more his time in prison and release back to his world because of his daughter's state autistic as well i think she is bland does little except stare and is under the full control of her father the film continues in the exceptionally bleak seul contre tous if you can watch these two films this one first it has some truly excellent acting but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tone br br 7 out of 10
<START> spoilers a jewish frodo yep that'll be elijah wood again br br ever since the concluding part of lord of the rings elijah wood as frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role playing a football hooligan a psychopath and now a young jewish american wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting now with everything is illuminated he might finally have achieved this playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts he truly gets to the soul of his character still it isn't like wood does this alone aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer liev schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings everything is illuminated is a magnificent moving piece of cinema br br jonathan safran foer wood a young american jew sets out to the ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america arriving in the country jonathan meets the all talking all dancing alex and his racist grandfather boris travelling across the country the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existed br br it's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter it is actually divided into four overall the first part whilst occasionally a bit funny is mostly serious and intense so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step it doesn't quite work but as the film progresses it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes br br to the ultimate credit of everyone involved as the story does continue so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more elijah wood is magnificent boris is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him most notable of all however is newcomer eugene playing an intensely troubled character is absolutely brilliant he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill and when his character is communicating with wood you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level without the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent but with him it hits the next level br br as a debut work for actor turned director liev schreiber the story is also a brilliant piece to start a work of passion grandfather himself an immigrant to america he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots he manages to really hit home the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye it is a moving story and with help it becomes even more powerful br br constructed with love from a passionate director everything is illuminated is a beautiful piece a road story with a difference it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written it's a film that everyone should see and it is the perfect way for elijah wood to finally lay frodo to rest
<START> one true thing rises above its potentially schlocky material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed real people it opens with rene discussing her mother's death with the district attorney sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a shocking illness and death from there it proceeds into a look at a family system in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change br br william hurt as the self important father and meryl streep as the suzy homemaker mother are both superb nuanced and not what they appear to be is seething angry and surprised with herself tom everett scott doesn't have much to do but he does it well br br the story is predictable and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn't have taken but the performances and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed make it worthwhile
<START> i can tell by the other comments that nobody could ever actually enjoy this trifling piece of crap that's the same way i felt br br the whole time i was watching it i was horrified that anyone could make a movie this stupid what is the world coming to i guess it is my fault for sitting through the entire movie ugh but it was like a bad car wreck i couldn't look away br br if you are a kid under 8 years of age you might like this movie otherwise stay away from it at all costs it's the stupidest movie i've ever seen br br everything's stupid the story script and especially the acting everything while watching the movie you'll either turn the tv off and think how can a movie be so sadly stupid or keep on watching from curiosity to see if things can get more stupid than this they can't br br these movie makers if you can call them that need to seriously go back to their day jobs not one of them has an ounce of talent and i highly doubt you can make a living churning out such horrible useless garbage that no one in their right minds would ever want to see br br just drawn out b s don't waste your time
<START> good accompanying medieval swordplay also the movie looks sleeker than most b movies but let's face it quake or doom has more atmosphere br br bad unintelligent plot no acting and totally unbelievable universe i am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies heck i love a good b movie like split second and the likes but this one has has nothing but boredom and clichÃ© to offer totally predictable from start to end oh and i forgot the lousy special effects they look more like an old playstation game than anything out of myth the use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me br br conclusion quite simply boring if you want to see lara croft buy the game it's way sexier
<START> nearly everything that stephen king has ever written seems to have been turned into a film or tv series in fact i'm surprised that no one has tried to make a mini series from the guy's grocery list let's face it if they did it couldn't be any less interesting than children of the corn br br based on one of king's many short stories this 1984 horror flick sees linda hamilton and peter horton playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy nebraska town of where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the corn fields br br although director fritz does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning after hamilton's silly song and dance but before we get to meet the freakish isaac leader of the killer kids he completely blows it with endless unexciting scenes in which hamilton and horton are hunted down by the town's homicidal half pints courtney gains as violent redhead manages to appear genuinely menacing but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening as a result many of the film's 'scary' moments fail to work br br towards the end of the film when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding the film descends into a glut of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years ago but look positively laughable nowadays br br children of the corn might be of interest to king fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen but your average horror film fan will be most unimpressed
<START> treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie and really squandered it don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since this movie really stands out hair is a musical that really deals with the attitude and probably more so with the persona of the famed peace movement of the 60's there is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion unlike the music videos of the late 70's 80's and 90's the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music in other words the video makes sense when matched with the songs so you know it never could've made it on mtv the subject matter dwells on drugs and being hippies but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless tragedies of viet nam one of the protagonists is an oklahoma boy intent on making a difference believing all the patriotic dribble he is spoon fed and he happens upon a gang in new york who are more or less glorified hoodlums their characters are very unique and probably wouldn't make sense today but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards what ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads but the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entrance is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of all time in cinema partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation despite their faults you come to love these people a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale
<START> if i'd only seen the poster for nurse betty i probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten foot pole but after i heard some positive buzz and knowing it made some noise at cannes i decided to give it a try what i got is a truly enjoyable movie based on a very entertaining plot rene is impressive in her role as betty a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience i also liked morgan freeman no surprise and was pleasantly surprised by foul mouthed comedian chris rock br br the film bounces continuously between comedy drama romance and thriller yet despite this apparent identity crisis it holds up quite well i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story the entire cast is strong if not spectacular br br my only real complaint is that director neil labute who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark the company of men' relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions the mood creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable and he did the standard old let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance trick just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots br br but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations in a very subpar year for movies 'nurse betty' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000 8 out of 10
<START> i loved this movie you can't buy it rent it or find it but it's a keeper br br wonderful chemistry between and walken and br br terrific non stop action and reactions loved it br br i've watched my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade each time showing it to someone who never heard of it br br find this movie and watch it br br so many films are on tv over and over again without any of the wit and style of this little film br br i didn't know it was made for tv my copy is an 8 track i pirated years ago i hope it lasts
<START> i first saw robin hood men in tights back in 1994 in the cinema i went to see it because i always liked robin hood and i saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious after i saw the movie i must say it was even better than i thought not only is it very funny it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by mann the acting in the movie is also good cary elwes is funny as robin hood and also tracey ullman richard lewis mark blankfield david chapelle amy yasbeck megan cavanagh eric allan kramer matthew porretta and mel brooks himself are funny but the best part in the movie is played by roger rees as the evil sheriff of he has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue king illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is which stands for it is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest he somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands robin hood men in tights is in my book one of the best mel brooks films to date and i can't say that i have laughed as much about a film as this one it's just non stop laughing
<START> the retelling of a classic story is set to the music of burt bacharach and lyrics of hal david the actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical la it is a joy to watch bobby van whose acting puts me in mind of red buttons and as always george kennedy cool hand luke who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles br br the surprise here is charles boyer as the elder high lama who would have known br br all star cast including michael york and olivia hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people
<START> sometimes you get exactly what you expect a film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit and in this case it certainly doesn't in fact as expected the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray is characterized by excess drugs and over the top antics but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun utilizing a script by carl dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe and wasting the talents of edward furlong the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 kiss concert
<START> being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club this also includes apes chimps and orangutans i am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best cause mischief shenanigans solve human problems and teach us about ourselves br br the story is simple enough in short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants luckily there's a few monkeys chimpanzees that have a bounty on their head that would get boba fett or dog's duane chapman blood flowing as the boy tries to catch the monkeys he learns about himself his family his grandpa the local weirdo flirts with a girl twice his age and learns the beast way to deal with bullies is to have someone point a shotgun at them br br there within lies the problem so much focus is put on the boy that the chimps just don't get the screen time they deserve the chimps are not as talented as the chimp s that play jack from the m p trilogy or the legendary orangutans that play or clyde 1 or 2 so don't watch this movie expecting to find the next big thing in the chimp genre the chimps hit some sweet flips which is what the film needed more of there is an epic scene of the chimps breaking into the poor families house and destroys all the things they worked so hard for serious monkey movie enthusiasts will want to rent the film for this scene alone br br so in closing this movie is not for the serious monkey movie enthusiast i wouldn't recommend this movie to families as it encourages a childs rebellion against their parents i can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well supervised children
