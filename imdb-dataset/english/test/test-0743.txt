<START> the regard of flight and the clown as performed by bill irwin are some of the funniest both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags performances i've ever seen my father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since we quote it back and forth fairly constantly it's a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase i have a bad vhs copy that i acquired from a specialty distributer a few years ago but mr irwin's performance deserves a proper dvd treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performers producers as well as more examples of modern clowning br br bill irwin's talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances i share the regard of flight with friends quite often and though i am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when i mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville i have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it in case the powers that be ever happen upon this imdb listing please consider releasing this and other bill irwin work
<START> i haven't seen any other films by antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works maybe if i had seen other stuff by him i would have enjoyed this one knowing what to expect br br i saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons first of all the film introduces interesting deep issues about social relationships feelings the nature of reality versus fiction but this is very often done in the of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches rambling on and on juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues the scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing br br secondly the movie has no rhythm especially in its first half it is not only that it is slow some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm el sur by victor or scorsese's the age of innocence are examples i like but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it this does not happen in beyond the clouds where the first episode seems to drag endlessly and the relationship between john reality and the love stories fiction is at times fluid others abrupt others confusing
<START> this appalling piece of tripe was conveniently loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine played by jack thompson and jacqueline mackenzie br br this film is offensive besides the fact that it wasn't a particular good film anyway it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the true life tragedy br br as for the director he managed to cash in on a family's misfortune for the price of a porsche br br if i could have given this a zero i would have br br avoid this film at all costs
<START> what can i say i got up this morning and turned on sci fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out strange unusual and brilliant it gives all potential and to think at first i said this looks stupid this has got to be the next best thing since x files but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion i am telling you it's scary and then suspenseful and then mellow towards the end you have miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species you have two people on the run from authorities and a killer tsunami about to strike wow and did i mention miles pet is a potential killer well the rest of his species is surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that delivers it all
<START> well well even if you're a fervent admirer of lang's silent films this early one the first part of a two part unfinished four part serial will leave you in doubt about fritz's narrative skills his directorial skills aren't that evident either but here and there one senses his talent for building up atmosphere br br the just pure juvenile nonsense which wouldn't be half as bad were it not for the long ponderous stretches in between the childish action scenes br br but the whole affair almost gets by on its amiable innocence br br 4 out of 10 inca treasures
<START> predator island starts as six friends eric tom dahl chris dan gordon along with heather iris grace kim baker denise melissa roby get invited to spend sometime on kevin's michael father's boat partying in the open sea what could go wrong with such a super sounding idea well for starters a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat an alien life force could emerge from it try to kill all of you then again that's just a ridiculously stupid idea isn't it br br co edited written directed by steven castle i thought predator island was crap it's a simple straight forward as that really the script is of the worst kind you know the sort of abomination that's full of highly annoying teenage character's who do say the most stupid things it's full of clichÃ©s is utterly predictable it makes next to no sense things just suddenly happen without any build up or explanation it's boring even at only 70 odd minutes it has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever not even unintentional laugh value the film doesn't really have much of what i would call a plot there's no explanation given as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's minds or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment the person will be 'normal' the next when the story calls for it with no apparent cause they suddenly get green glowing eyes a sudden urge to turn cannibal there's not enough horror in it the so called action scenes are pitiful i really don't want to waste another second thinking about predator island let alone wasting my precious energy typing these words br br director castle doesn't do anything to make this thing watchable the 'special effects' are absolutely terrible this alien creature dude wouldn't even get into a 50's sci fi film the filmmakers even play some blooper footage over the end credits but this has to be the least funny collection of mistakes ever i mean they can't even get it wrong right if you know what i mean forget about any decent gore as there isn't any there's a bit of cannibalism some intestines placed on the unfortunate actors stomach so another unfortunate actor can pick them up pretend to eat them br br with a supposed budget of about 150 000 i have to concede that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget that's still no excuse for making such a poor film the whole thing looks very cheap the acting is pretty bad br br predator island is crap i'm sorry but that's the way it is i just fail to see what anyone would get out of it in my humble opinion this probably one to avoid
<START> i classify this as the worst movie of all time br br if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies this would be it the plot is ridiculous there are only 2 characters and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief br br these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie br br my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in i figured that a movie this boring and slow must have some cool interesting plot twist and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized br br i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life
<START> i've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more i think jordana brewster should have received an emmy nomination for her real and natural performance many of us who were age at this time the story takes place will understand how real it is life for most of us is neither softly glowing romantic or harshly cynical pessimism it is a blurred balance and this film captures this balance it is well constructed too with so many fine details in its composition like the film or not judging from the extraordinarily high ratings it gets from the demographic of females under 18 we can know that this movie reveals some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world
<START> night hunter is a sold b style action movie get a life and grow up people don the dragon wilson is a kick boxer hall of fame and not an actor if your looking for an oscar it's not here brother looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget this is it the plot line may have been a little thin but what b movie isn't i understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure get real people judging every movie like it is an oscar contender just silly awesome fight scenes mixed with a new twist on vampire moves see it if your a fan rent something else if your a hater
<START> first time i saw this great movie and alyssa my star playing frances ella fitz was so great in this movie it was just so real and her little dog so cute i saw it the first time when i was like 11 years old and it was the best movie i had ever seen and you know what i still think so 10 10 greatest ever
<START> not every line in a comedy is funny this movie takes a serious subject the of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it it's the movie the daily show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie i found robin williams to be much funnier in this movie than he was in rv and while my wife and i share a few opposing political views we were both doubled over in laughter for several parts of this movie the script writers here could give fox news some lessons in fair and balanced lewis black was okay for his part but never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role christopher walken was also good playing his fairly common subdued supporting role pushing a story along
<START> i just don't know how this stupid crap junk garbage good for nothing film is a blockbuster it was so boring with a very very weak or no story line and wasn't even a jot funny the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem salman khan is a love guru and is helping hapless romantic govinda to get the girl he wants i'm not saying that i didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story the only two reasons why i can say it's a super hit are br br 1 salman khan govinda are on screen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it can't be but it was a really good movie br br 2 salman khan's name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya so it's just luck br br i heard that it's a remake of hitch i've not seen it i'm glad i didn't music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner you're my love soni de but what is the use of it in a really bad film that too if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet she is completely crap neither she knows acting language her voice is always dubbed for her dance and always fails to impress i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again
<START> if this film is examined closely it's a bit sad it is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children who grow up in poor dysfunctional environments yet it retains it's comedic value with spirited performances by diahann carroll and james earl jones the sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother carroll who cannot truly help her children not because she doesn't want to or try but because it's obvious she doesn't know how remember this is a comedy but if you've never seen this or if you have watch this film and see the humanity in the characters good film
<START> this movie just screened on channel seven australian tv today br br in my opinion it was a very interesting take on how the nazi's treated the russian jews as mercilessly as everywhere else br br kellie martin did a really great job and her tears and frustration as were quite convincing br br the holocaust is a part of our history that we must not forget schindlers list wasn't the first and it wont be the last account of survival and courage in that five year nightmare my family is dutch and i will always applaud any movie makers who want to keep the candlelight alive by telling of someone's courage to stand up and help those who were being abused violated and murdered for being a jew
<START> compared to battle of britain this is a real film with real characters and a real plot battle of britain is basically a documentary with the occasional lawrence olivier and michael caine but the real protagonists are the spits the hurricanes etc here on the other hand you have two well wrought characters actually three and a real plot i strongly recommend it to anybody even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies it's well filmed and i wonder what the director might do if he had the big capitals behind him and i do not think that it's over sentimental it's only that in the fighters you have real people with real feelings and a real life as real as any fictional life in any great film
