<START> i wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace i felt like many of the other things were not for example br br how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her br br the very strong and well acted love scenes br br the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more br br their strong differences of what it means to be created by their prior life experiences br br the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie br br i've heard and read several things about used in other films' of course however i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well i don't need a director to use new tricks i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film br br i recommend it
<START> it pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame repetitive and lazy series it is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing in a bad way whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research instead of filling it with one liners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes from the first movie over and over and over and over again sure they get a little creative but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist pretty much like listening to creed or has to prevent himself from failing has a complicated plan but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion someone questions the monkey and the bug appears in the background flirts with she disses him without sounding like a bitch disguises herself as principal and she calls and he forgets that she is i admit this show does have it's moments another problem is the fact that looks younger and looks weird also no one can replace david spade and john goodman their the ones who made and and sorry but i give this show two thumbs down
<START> this movie has a lot to recommend it the paintings the music and david naked butt are all gorgeous the plot a story of redemption forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching and it's not predictable which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age but the acting is mediocre the direction is confusing and the script is just odd it often felt like it was trying to be a parody but i never figured out what it was trying to be parody of and if it's not a parody well it remains a movie with great potential that it didn't live up to
<START> the beat is too strong we're deaf mutants now like them rex br br i am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of the beat and why you must see this film now br br make no mistake this movie is cheesy and bad in the conventional sense the story is preposterous the poetry is silly and the acting is inconsistent br br but these are the film's charms all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most underappreciated cheezy films of the 80's br br if the reference to deaf mutants didn't pique your interest then perhaps this will what kind of name is rex anyway it is such an unusual name for north american audiences that i said to myself even the names of the characters in this friggin' movie are silly br br well the beat is so fabulously cheezy that the meaning and symbolism behind rex is revealed not too subtly by bart waxman the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate i won't spoil the revelation behind rex's name but please don't get too excited o k br br overall the acting is inconsistent john savage who plays the concerned teacher mr ellsworth is pretty good as is the fellow playing bart waxman but the rest of the cast are unconvincing that said the acting does not detract from the film why there is a sincerity in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing so although the performances may suck you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best as a result the actors' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails which is quite often br br the homage to beat poetry in this film is bad bad bad but this is a good good good thing when it comes to entertainment would you actually enjoy better quality or more respectable poetry especially in a film like this br br folks that would be boring think about the droll they made us read in high school sanitized to avoid corrupting the youth politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis etc even if you don't like poetry or arty movies with all of the intellectual posturing that implies you most certainly can and should appreciate ludicrous poetry in a wannabe art film how could you not enjoy the following br br do you remember the roar of the dinosaur a woman's scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad oh the woman's so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today yeah today br br yes that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout the beat but what about the story you ask br br well the story is preposterous but then again that is the beauty of this film apart from some cliches stereotypes and predictable plot points there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot story to keep things interesting who is rex where did he come from what the heck is he talking about deaf mutants illiterate angels do billy and kate really understand what rex is saying is the audience supposed to understand rex and his poetry posse i've seen the movie several times and i still haven't figured everything out br br will bad poetry and high school talent shows really end gang violence br br i guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like the beat a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry mediocre yet sincere acting and a conquers gang violence storyline that has yet to be rivalled by any film ever made br br bonus for fans of classic nyc hardcore the cro mags make a rare film appearance as the iron skulls and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs i wish they included more concert footage but maybe that will be an extra included on the collector's edition dvd i fantasize about br br
<START> this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale br br the movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end you'll always be wondering what's in those documents everyone's after it also has some biting commentary on american politics br br this movie shows why in my opinion is in a three way tie with and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
<START> i thought it was terrific very realistic and funny dialogue and realistic action in a i didn't like how the jennifer storyline is not really concluded or how the ending doesn't give us closure holly hunter fit the part perfectly she's one crazy actress this movie is well worth seeing
<START> i saw this again today for the first time in about 6 years i had forgotten how well acted this movie is paul newman gets the billing but dwight schultz holds his own and shows how good an actor he really is
<START> natalie wood portrays courtney patterson a disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair with her partner being attorney marcus simon played tepidly by wood's real life husband robert wagner the film is cut heavily but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood who also proffers a fine soprano the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner's dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood which must be discouraging to an actress the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this coupled with choppy editing leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing although largely undistinguished the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and following the sound of a closing door remains at the center while the camera's eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty more controlled direction would have allowed the performers even the limp wagner to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship as it was released there is for the most part an immense lack of commitment
<START> amitabh and khan raised great expectations by their press conferences though it was quite easy for the critics and the fans too that after all this much hyped ram gopal verma factory product is going to fall flat on it's face in all the probabilities why because was so immature and childish and bacchan mixed up guilty and unsure they themselves didn't know what the hell they were talking about to the press keeping up with the tag line that some love stories are not to be understood or some such rubbish why the title is nishabd ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of sanskrit as vidhu vinod needs to study tagging in line another glorious flop of the year comparison with the sweet hearts and is inevitable as the so called plot line is supposed to have inspired by them but sadly ramu has hardly made any serious effort to delve deeply into the psyche of the aging and the young ones is lolly pop sucking the ultimate indicator of the innocence and contrary to that streak of childishness the leg show at the dining table with a vijay that is bacchan in that role bursting into squeals of shameless laughter incessantly after wards this girl is in fact at her seductive game luring poor vijay to think she is in love with him the legs too are skinny enough and that act of putting the water hose through the legs is down right obscene it's beyond any one's understanding how can a girl coming as a guest to some body's house can be so brazen brash and over powering and why the hell that stupid wife played by remarkably well though scripted poorly and characterized unrealistically encourages her own husband to dance with a sexily saying young girl that part of vijay trying to gain some to his humdrum life is absolute bullshit because apparently it seems that he is happy as he is with a well settled life and a hobby to recreate this reminds of blame it on rio the older daddy and his young love superbly played by michael caine bacchan looks terrible in close ups and over all where as kevin spacey and jeremy irons looked debonair and handsome which is why the young chicks some times get attracted to older men for their charming persona compared to the vulnerability of young boys of their age only good thing about this movie is those green sprawling land scapes winding roads and pleasant cinematography no substance or even any sparkling show of emotions drama or even intriguing stormy sex like in lolita this shallow movie has no wonder fallen flat on it's face and had to be wound up from the screens during first weeks next time round before mindlessly copying any such theme from hollywood ramu should do his home work and bacchan should think twice you can not fool all the people at all the times mr bacchan
<START> david cronenberg's is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism it addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical the movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic one in this context the technology is able to be part of human body after playing the virtual reality game of the real world feels like a game and as a result human behavior change in order to apply violent game urges even when the game is over in technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system an idea that reflects marshall belief who is a well known media theorist that computers are extensions of human consciousness like telephone is an of the ear television is an of the eye telegram is an of the central nervous system high tech virtual reality is an of human consciousness in technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world but as technology becomes organic humans become more mechanical and therefore less free unable to resist their game urges is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence jean describes a society in his book of simulacra and simulation which all power to act has been transformed to appear the world has passed into a pure simulation of itself in it is obvious to see society with the themes of the invasion of the body the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other br br while you are in the consciousness slowly replaces with another identity your role in the game which is a reflection each individual's real life subconscious while you gain the control of your life step by step the aura of your real life for simulations or simulacra have become more than real ' our like cronenberg's world of computer simulation now feels and for all intents and purposes is more real than what we call the real world ' the purpose of the game which can basically be called is quite metaphorical because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it as say that life without an exact explanation is absurd the game of is absurd too cronenberg ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives for instance in the game the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre programmed question and when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes the exposed absurdity really shocks br br the theme of the game is to understand what it is for this hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play they have no doubt about their existence however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence the essence br br have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature or essence as other animals and plants do each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature in the formulation of the 20th century french philosopher jean paul sartre existence precedes essence choice is therefore central to human existence and it is inescapable even the refusal to choose is a choice freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility because individuals are free to choose their own path have argued they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads ' perhaps i should mention deals with the concept of freedom of choice too you achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions if you don't than the game becomes and boring so you begin to interrogate the game your existence rather than your essence you suddenly become from the game and realize your position outside the game well as a last word is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism br br
<START> i would label this show as horrendous if it weren't for the fact that it's on the same network as arrested development because it is on fox and getting renewed while ad got cancelled br br it is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is but let me try and describe it take an extremely low rate archie bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on married with children then take great plot lines from ad son has an ugly boring girlfriend and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them br br if you watch this i will have completely lost respect for you as should your family however if you are a fan you should love fox's new comedy 'til death looks like real funny cutting edge stuff i mean married couples not getting along brilliant
<START> this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering the acting wasn't the greatest i'll admit that but it was passionate about it's message sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual they even had a damn trial for saddam so why doesn't every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place i'm getting off the movie but i think it's worthy to note about this sick twisted idea the government has the movie's way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery the whole movie i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it's made very obvious in the end there's no doubt that the directing was incredible but the one thing i didn't care for was that there wasn't as much emphasis on reese witherspoon's character's interest and fight in the ideal she held a lot of skipping otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played
<START> in landscape after the battle in the second era of his filmmaking career depicts emotional and psychological confusion in a former nazi prison in poland freed immediately after the wwii br br a hand held camera explores a lot of extreme close ups and vivid colors the end credit as graffiti on of freight train cars symbolically concludes the film the soundtrack is great except vivaldi which sounds tacky in pop art fashion in the opening sequence
<START> i just watched this today on tv it was on abc's sunday afternoon movie br br this wasn't a very good movie but for a low budget independent film like this it was okay there is some suspense in it but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down the script is pretty lame and the plot elements aren't very realistic such as the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder i don't know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea but it isn't very realistic br br i thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good but unfortunately they never did there were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this and in the end didn't prove to be very creative br br if there is something good about this movie it is the cast every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with the terribly underrated actress elizabeth pena was great in this movie she is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice however if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good watch the excellent animated movie the incredibles in that movie she put her sexy voice to good use br br what can i say this movie isn't really worth your time but the actors were good unfortunately they were all wasted on this movie which is a real shame this movie tried to be a good suspense thriller but in the end it fell flat if you want to see a good movie that is similar to this but much better see the hitcher if you want to see something with the cast members of this movie watch any of their other movies you can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it
<START> the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters don't br br this might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance short sightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to me br br the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we don't see any character depth the all down yet we're left with no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode once some character sub plots had been established br br the highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action espionage br br the flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to digest all the goings on so i couldn't recommend this for owning but it's certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think it's worth your time to watch this but it's not something to rush out and buy br br in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity
