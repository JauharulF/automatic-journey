<START> i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie these girls at the philadelphia film festival going into the movie i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down br br these girls is the story about three best friends from a small town keira caroline is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do lisa holly lewis will be going away to a christian school after the summer and finally glory amanda walsh who plans on spending her summer babysitting but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark david boreanaz the sexy older hunk who they baby sit for fun times and a lot of laughs br br i normally don't like movies like these girls but there is something about this movie that i really liked i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later it's a pretty funny tale about growing up friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy i can see majority of this film happening in real life br br the subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the united states all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16 now in the usa even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies won't finance a film like this because of the sexual content this information was actually confirmed by the director himself john at the q a after the film the thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life go figure br br what the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters i liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a now then characteristic to them the jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama the script was very strong br br the acting was very good for the most part i thought all the three girls were great caroline who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time wonderfalls was just terrific as well as holly lewis and amanda walsh who both did a fine job as well david boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes the guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role br br i had the pleasure of meeting john tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film i am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere i think with a little marketing behind it it could have taken off sadly it's going to be one of these direct to dvd films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see i think with what little budget mr had to work with the film turned out well and i think he did a fine job directing this little gem br br for someone who typically hates teen sex comedies i can honestly say i really enjoyed this film the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused this is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it i know i will be sure to buy this film when it comes on dvd on may 16 2006 if you're a fan of coming of age stories teen sex comedies or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years br br moviemanmenzel's final rating for these girls is an 8 10
<START> i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was i was looking forward to it after reading the plot even though i find nirvana overrated it sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that jansen puts in little touches like the books kubrick book among others movie posters etc i like when i see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film and you can really feel that in this there are tons of scenes and moments that i love i am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and i would say the only thing i can think of are cameron crowe films takes little moments and makes them stand out and special the soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film this film is amazingly shot and the editing is outstanding i could really go on and on about the film i cannot recommend this enough really if you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out
<START> i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie that was humorous however my expectations were let down this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg 13 movie this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie i wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this br br even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie beware of a truly stupid movie there's no humor in the movie just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia something that shouldn't even be joked about br br i would like to know what happened to pg 13 movies that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re rated
<START> i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club you know those hip cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night well there's not one ounce of cool in this ridiculous movie the score is goofy the original songs are awful both lead actors' singing is continually off key to be kind and unprofessional at best the plot is no more complex than boy meets girl the acting is laughable and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly busy organ music this joey de francesco should keep his day job unless his day job is helping with movie scores is it possible to not only get my four dollars back but have my therapy sessions paid for as well this movie interestingly enough is so bad you might want to watch it sort of like driving by a bad accident you just have to look at least once just get the ear plugs ready
<START> poor jane austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation so many great jane austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies i despise the man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of david copperfield my main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book jane austen was poking fun at the gothic mania in her society and much of the novel is tongue in cheek the movie however is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically the lighthearted fun poking flavor of austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray horror meets period drama the scenes of catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting also henry is dreadfully unappealing why i ask would anyone fall for him if you are looking for a fun filled jane austen evening watch emma instead
<START> i will admit my ignorance of this film's existence until i saw it advertised on a cable outlet i was very impressed with the novelistic structure of the film the film which is in a language i do not understand shone with intelligence and nuance for me i think this speaks to the film's quality it was visually stunning the acting was visually entrancing the chinese theater traditions of movement used to enhance the delivery of dialogue is so compelling after watching western film where actors traditionally focus more heavily on the dialogue the action in this film comes right at you without a lot of explosions to get your attention it is human action that is so affective here the added advantage that the film taught me history about one of the world's greatest tourist attractions the funereal clay army of china's first emporer was very impressive it seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes this is a film i can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances
<START> anthony writer director cold mountain is a carefully constructed sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and portrays changes among the non slave owning common people wrought by the war and almost uniquely cold mountain does not over generalize southerners northerners or anybody else br br the film surfs through genres as needed never presenting a dull moment it is a romance a war story an action adventure and historical fiction all nicely woven into one br br the story centers on jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons as this young romance begins to bud enlists in the confederate army taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn in other words as she admits to ruby renee zellweger she is a master of everything useless br br ada's father passes on and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself with no experience of this sort she struggles and survives by holding the memory of close to her heart ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks and as they become inseparable business partners they grow to love one another as best friends experience is radically different but something of a mirror image during his participation in the war he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in and decides to desert nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada and most of those he meets die br br the bulk of the film takes place during long walk following both of the protagonists as they live learn grow and change an on going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love for it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation for ada it is very much the same thing but also a symbol and remnant of the old south a world which is rapidly passing br br the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history the script and editing are also extremely strong emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes with the cast of this film nothing short of perfection should be expected and the cast mostly rises to the occasion my one criticism however relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips i admit my to this and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people performance is outstanding and she creates a character i will remember into my br br very highly recommended
<START> okay first the good thing if you saw the trailer then you know about 100 of the scary jumpy moment of the movie and yes it's a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the movie br br i now understand why sarah michelle gellar did not stay alive in that movie for very long she did not want to associate her name with this production i wish her the best for the return br br you have to follow 3 different story in this movie and they are all disconnected in time and meaning until the very end and even then it's a very bad climax and god forbid even open the door to another sequel br br yes in this movie the rage and fury is on the move no need to visit the house anymore just be close to someone who when inside and you're done it's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus go inside the house get scared return back to usa and spread the joy in your apartment building br br it's not that difficult to follow but you just don't really care about anyone the plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head milk anyone i saw ju on 2 at the fantasia movie festival last summer different story completely but much better than this dud it's not a remake but this time maybe they should have simply done a remake br br if you must see it wait for the dvd
<START> i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that i saw in theaters when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do needless to say ten minutes in the movie and i loved it amanda was a great actor in the movie her comedic timing was perfect the guy who played duke was hot plain and simple my favorite scene was definitely when amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses as she is pretending to be a guy i re watched this part over and over to make a long story short the movie i thought was going to be lame i now own it
<START> great story and great lead actors quaid and ryan but the movie suffers from bad directing bad screenplay and bad script the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all too bad because this could have been a good 80's style hitchcock suspense mystery thriller ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though an ok look for big ryan fans
<START> if anyone has any doubts about the talent of liev schrieber just a look at his new film everything is illuminated which clearly shows a man that is not only one of america's finest actors but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow mr schreiber has adapted the novel by jonathan safran foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material the film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas br br for those who haven't watched the film perhaps you should stop reading here br br jonathan is a collector his love for his grandparents is boundless he watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed on a clear moment this dying woman gives jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection watching the photograph taken a long time ago a young couple are seen together watching makes jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend taken on happier times watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors' past in the ukraine br br jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency heritage tours of odessa for his trip to the mythical place where his grandfather came from the agency is handled by an older man who claims to be blind and his grandson alex a man who loves the pop american culture that has captured his imagination as well as his contemporaries in the country alex speaks a kind of english no one speaks and his conversation and translation for jonathan's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard english terms the old man insists in taking his dog sammy davis jr against the wishes of jonathan who doesn't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip br br as they embark in search of it's clearly that his companions especially the old man has no clue where he is going at this point the film becomes a road movie as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another as the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end it indicates they have indeed come to the right place some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past br br the older woman living in the isolated place is the missing link of the story she is able to put things into the right perspective but here is where the story changes its emphasis from jonathan who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors to the old man we watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself this in turn changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected jonathan and his guides have been all the time br br some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story which after all it's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken it would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book the great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what's about to be seen br br elijah wood a magnificent film actor does an excellent work by underplaying jonathan mr wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character the casting of eugene as alex the ukranian tour assistant and translator seems to be an idea made in heaven mr is about the best thing in the film his arcane usage of english gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer boris as alex's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film as well as who is seen in the last part of the movie br br the excellent cinematography of matthew brings the splendor of the czech republic's countryside in all its magnificence the musical score by paul is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie br br above all this is a triumph for liev schreiber the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next
<START> while most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra end up being cheap imitations of the 'aliens' series pitch black stands as a fine piece of sci fi and an excellent movie all around perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting this movie beautifully employs many different colors shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to vin diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal after all the film is about diesel's character personal journey so thankfully vin doesn't drop the ball the remainder of the cast with the exception of the talented and gorgeous claudia black were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms pitch black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget the special effects are more than adequate but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus as in many high budget 'blockbusters' it's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to tell an engaging provoking story rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of science fiction
<START> hellboy revolves around classic comic book action superhero genre story lines essentially hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth he is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural rather then be a menace the normal career route for a demon br br the set up of the story involves creative uses of history combining nazi experiments with the occult it's preposterous but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets i find the explanations of the characters who they are and how they came to be very well handled the sequences are to the point and very entertaining in fact the opening is the best part of the film therein lays the br br essentially del toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it the film is absent of all tension or any major conflict hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably hellboy will be ok and the bad guy will die i hear you cry that this is the case for any action hero film well yes it is but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die die hard works because john looks likely to die at all parts he escapes death by the of margins the stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etcÂ terminator and terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero the threat and tension is constant br br some of the other major weaknesses are del toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story the villain is featured in maybe three scenes he has no motives turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably in the one scene hellboy looks to be up against a real threat groups of monsters a character unleashes her abilities the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives a minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film her character is so thin the relationship so undeveloped it is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense i don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to br br the film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny after a while it all starts to grate br br what's more del toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals and whoever made the creative decision to make primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out br br the few positives include the cinematography is very good at all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette as well as the use of interesting locations yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well br br the use of cgi and fx is well done never do we get an over load when effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept rather similar to how nolan used fx in batman i much prefer this method to the effects we often see br br all in all this is a pretty poor film the real shame is that despite not reading the comics i found the film wasted a lot of potential hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored the film has watch ability in the sense that if it comes on tv and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing but in any other situation i wouldn't bother with it
<START> the horrific production doesn't qualify as a film it was obviously shot on video tape and very poorly at that there is a constant sound for the audio sounds like a bad microphone which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying badly dubbed in music will suddenly appear in a scene and the entire editing of this thing rates about a zero br br the plot is contrived and ridiculous a late 20's gay man trying to hide his live in lover from parents visiting please and the reaction the mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing his is beyond melodramatic and rolls right into stupid talk about a stereotypical view of gay life the acting is worse than a porno movie and the direction is very poor br br as far as production goes there isn't any br br this title is simply a lame videotaped attempt to call itself a film there is no heart and soul to give it even the smallest bit of praise br br it's just a stupid waste of time so avoid it at all costs bad acting bad writing bad directing and the title of producer is vanity as this trash probably them the price of the videotape they shot it on br br this ametuer garbage has no business getting released onto a dvd as it's deceptive to the i cannot stress how horrible this crap is br br
<START> based on the best selling novel the dismissal the missing star the latest film by acclaimed italian director gianni is the story of the growing friendship between an older italian maintenance man and a young interpreter he hires in shanghai to be his guide through china vincenzo is the maintenance manager at a steel mill in italy that has been shut down and the blast furnace sold to china when vincenzo sergio castellitto discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous he travels to china to find the steel mill where the part has been sold in hopes of preventing a fatal accident br br the film of course is about the journey not the destination to use a familiar clichÃ© and on that journey we are privy to an engaging look at china with all its immense beauty and complexity via the outstanding cinematography by luca the film takes us to shanghai and a trip along the river showing us coastal areas that are scheduled to be flooded when the three gorges dam is fully operative a chinese mega project that has resulted in the displacement of 1 2 million people the trip brings the travelers face to face with poverty overcrowded housing and children left to fend for themselves br br the film revolves around the relationship between vincenzo and translator liu tai ling who first meet in italy where his impatience with her translations at a dinner meeting causes her to lose her job when he tracks her down in shanghai she is working at a library and resistant to vincenzo's approach looking at his offer to help him in his travels in china as little more than a well paying job she reluctantly agrees to accompany him their relationship however grows as they move from city to city her interpretive skills much in evidence to help the bewildered vincenzo who does not own a cell phone br br as they slowly open up to each other they expose each other's vulnerability and the film delves into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation we meet liu's son lin wang at the home of her grandmother in china's one child policy he is one of the unwanted children who have been hidden since the father of the boy abandoned the family although the meeting between vincenzo and the boy is casual their relationship becomes central to how the story plays out br br castellitto is an excellent actor though one longs for a younger enrico lo in this role however he is emotionally distant throughout the film his expression rarely changing from a far away hangdog expression though tai ling brings a great deal of presence to the role her relationship with the much older vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as the movies though is one of my favorite directors coming on the heels of the brilliant keys to the house missing star is a disappointment
