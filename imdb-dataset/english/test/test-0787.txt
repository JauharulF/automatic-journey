<START> this is certainly a good film beautifully photographed and evocatively acted yet one should certainly criticize it and for it is not without flaws and weaknesses really cared for women and wanted to make statements on man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means this is certainly a case in 'the crucified lovers' 'princess yang and he sets the scenario in feudal japan which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right exclamation boy does suck i'm glad that it is over and true some of the scenarios such weaker films of present would be literary impossible today also his women characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self sacrifice which also simplifies the scenario less appealing saying that crucified lovers is a good film with such few relative weaknesses though the sometimes chilly cynical prose by the screenwriter helps this film allot i still highly prefer and recommend films of 1936 and of the as well as his late masterpieces in which he showed more restraint and subtlety and 'the life of
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released in pittsburgh pa i had traveled from youngstown ohio a distance of approx 85 miles i knew nothing of the plot nor the players i had read no reviews nor had i talked to anyone who had seen it believe me i will never make that mistake again it was being touted i believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3d process that was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip br br there was a waiting line two abreast that stretched i kid you not 2 or blocks long and moving very slowly i could hardy wait to be seated if i had only known at that moment what i soon would know i could have been Â¾ of the way back to youngstown by the time the feature started br br by the time the first 3d scene was shown i was already nodding off the novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony br br without going into excruciating detail i can only offer the following advice if you have ever seen the famous film plan nine from outer space supposedly the worst movie ever filmed it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage br br i don't know if this has ever been shown on tv if it has i don't know why if you ever get a chance to see it do something else take a walk cut the grass wash the dog have someone flog you with a rubber hose anything your time will have been better spent br br this has been my first movie review it might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and i wouldn't make book that will happen br br bill br br
<START> any movie should have an idea simple or more complex it needs one the problem with fragata it's once more that when he decides to make a movie he so anxious to do whatsoever that he forgets this main detail and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification behaving without justified reasons they are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind it's boring and sad to see them appearing and vanishing like cards being discarded in a game fragata always seem to have talent in advertising is own work and that leads you to see what he did but in the end there's always a big disappointment it's not enough having a movie full of the hot pink magazine stars especially when half of them can't act they only pretend to be funny here my only good point goes to the actor mendes one of the few non stars' he makes the effort to establish some credibility and in such a messy movie without any direction of any kind i give him the credit for trying hard but this movie its worth to check out as a manual of how to not do a movie and if previous works where bad this one it's a masterpiece in achieving the title of awful in few words just check it out it will make you good and if you homemade your family movies and always feel bad with your work so just spend 30 minutes looking to this so called professional work your home made stuff will look like powerful hollywood flicks compare to sorte nula
<START> i felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 9 10 rating i say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement perhaps the filmmaker himself or one of his mates has written that review naughty naughty br br i watched this movie on the propeller channel on sky tv expecting it to be truly awful the special effects used were to be honest very very good for a low budget film and some of the acting wasn't that bad either but most of the acting was really awful but well done for trying as i expect most were pals of the filmmaker br br i think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight i did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't br br if you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended this film is no way a 9 10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production
<START> i recently bought this movie for three bucks at a garage sale and while i'm glad i didn't have to pay the usual 19 99 for this dvd i was pleasantly surprised by how good the film was br br it's set up like a horror anthology broken up into 5 tales including the story which involves four teenagers who's car breaks down a dark lonely road in the middle of the night apparently these kiddos like horror stories because that's what they decide to do until morning tell spooky stories around a campfire each character takes their turn telling a story after which their own story is wrapped up with a nice little twist br br the first story the hook is kinda a waste of time a bit bland and dull luckily this is not one of the main stories and only lasts maybe 5 minutes it's intended merely to introduce the film and it's easy to overlook the unoriginality of this piece br br the second story the honeymooners is eh okay it's about you guessed it two people on their honeymoon they're traveling around in an rv headed to las vegas they decide to stop somewhere for the night but they're quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the location or risk being attacked by some dangerous unknown creatures this story has a pretty good setup but just merely an 'ok' delivery basically it's fairly entertaining and mysterious till the monsters show up then it's just kinda iffy br br the third story people can lick too is my personal favorite it involves a young girl who's parents are going out for the night and who's older sis is ditching her for a party so she's going to be all alone a fact she makes known to an internet buddy of hers trouble is that internet buddy is not exactly a thirteen year old girl this story's conclusion is slightly less climatic than i might have liked to have seen but still pretty dang good br br the final story the is definitely the one packed with the most atmosphere set in a creepy mansion on a dark rainy night it's the tale of a young man played by glenn quinn traveling around on a motorcycle who stumbles across this house just at the time that he conveniently has a problem with his bike he meets the mute girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight unfortunately not everything is all fine and dandy and it might have something to do with that hanging around her pretty neck br br after the stories are wrapped up we're presented with a twist involving the four teens in the car a twist which in retrospect should have been obvious but which it didn't really see coming and it's a quite pleasing conclusion to film br br so all in all a good movie rent it if you can because unfortunately i don't really think it has a lot re watching value but next time you're in the mood for a vaguely scary flick in the same vein as tales of the darkside or something grab this movie and some popcorn turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this surprisingly nifty little flick
<START> i have seen this film 3 times mostly because i kept thinking while watching it have i missed something here is there some reason this film was made was it trying to say something and i just missed it well after 3 viewings i failed to come up with an answer br br i guess the worst thing i can say about any film is that it bored me and i did not finish it i will admit there is plenty of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through but is that all a movie should be br br i am not against extreme violence it is almost non stop but it seems there should be some sort of inspiration something that is highlighted by it the word gratuitous comes to mind but it is worse then that somehow in the first part of the film we are all given insights into the motivations of the characters and yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles but the roles are completely unbelievable so in the first part we get to know the characters and in the second part most of em die and use sadistic glee in killing others that seems to be the whole movie and the first part has nothing to do with the second br br for example how could a nice smart guy like zed agree to join a bunch of junkies and amateurs to do a job like this it makes no sense he is portrayed as smart yet he goes ahead with this suicide mission the fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyper real violence and mayhem so what are we watching here a hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real super violent blood bath i recall having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved with true romance and dogs br br needless dreck
<START> i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake was it's so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top 10 worst films of 1998 about the only thing it had going for it was bruce willis who should stick to action films as a completely emotionless killer who'd kill his own mother for the right price but i'd rather listen to robbie talk american for a week than listen to richard gere's nauseating irish accent again but this film is also implausible unconvincing uneven unexciting unimpressive and lands sidney in a rubbish role to make a possible career comeback one for purposes entirely
<START> mattei andrÃ© is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty that is what the film is all about and a jewel robbery at the place br br corey delon brings the plan from prison vogel joins him and helps him against two tough guys who are after him because he took mafioso andre money while rico already took coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail corey and vogel find a third man jansen montand a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole a perfect plan and cooperation but they have to sell the booty and there is mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise the circle closes running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving mattei and his little pistol br br it took melville 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of france and in paris of yesteryear the great henri is as usual the lighting cameraman it is the one before last picture of who died after another film with delon in 1972 br br melville actually wanted belmondo instead of he didn't like that italian at all but vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives next to the most convincing performance but mind you melville notes that is an instinctive actor a strange character very wearying and absolutely impossible on a french set melville didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again br br melville is wrong give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters you can see what he is feeling being chased by mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of france in winter 70 a wild actor br br also andrÃ© who passed away close to the time of the filming he also was not first choice but definitely a great substitute he carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more br br jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually a successful shot when he meets delon the first time we already know that the elegant jansen has a severe drinking problem after the robbery montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to delon who looks up to him that he only got into the red circle because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe delon doesn't catch what he means the audience recalls having seen montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him at that time a very rare scene one recalls a long time after i bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making great artwork when art was made by hand br br we sure will remember a crew like the actors still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of melville what is wrong with it i am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors showing three criminals and their police hunter we learn too little about corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl anna montand is still a great sniper but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai is the man in the trunk of american car and superbly moving and mattei is swell to look at a great actor at the edge of his life but how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty br br in an interview melville states that there is no woman in the film not in the very red circle but i remember well that jolly good looking female anna with no future career we are in the 70s there in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover delon bardot did something like that 10 years earlier this time melville was directing well done br br the red has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history the robbery at place and wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and escaping in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie but the 110 minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level and there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again none of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late francois perier is also featured br br michael
<START> ok so i really like kris kristofferson and his usual easy going delivery of lines in his movies age has helped him with his soft spoken low energy style and he will steal a scene effortlessly but disappearance is his misstep holy moly this was a bad movie br br i must give kudos to the cinematography and and the actors including kris for trying their darndest to make sense from this goofy confusing story none of it made sense and kris probably didn't understand it either and he was just going through the motions hoping someone would come up to him and tell him what it was all about br br i don't care that everyone on this movie was doing out of love for the project or some such nonsense i've seen low budget movies that had a plot for goodness sake this had none zilcho nada zippo empty of reason a complete waste of good talent scenery and celluloid br br i rented this piece of garbage for a buck and i want my money back i want my 2 hours back i invested on this grade f waste of my time don't watch this movie or waste 1 minute of your valuable time while passing through a room where it's playing or even open up the case that is holding the dvd believe me you'll thank me for the advice
<START> the only reason i watched this movie a second time was to learn the name of the second banana girl playing opposite katie her name is marisa never heard of her before she is lovely captivating with an animated face and cute bod she is highly watchable she's got real more than a passing vibe of grace kelly with youthful exuberance i think she is irish in gene pool my favorite female dna so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american the movie is unremarkable katie is classic beauty in the flesh but marisa is the one you follow with your eyes in 1999 when this movie was made she was around 25 years old in her prime this reminds me of another silly worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it it was career opportunites with the first time i saw jennifer or grease ii the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer
<START> hello i normally love movies i'm 19 i have seen many and dislike only one or two this one though the second it finished i had to pull my sister who had wanted to see it out by the arm and i burst into tears of laughter as soon as i got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie br br why it was awful all the cows had especially bothersome were the male ones with none of the characters were unique or engaging except perhaps the main coyote the idea of cows keeping watch against coyotes is just ridiculous the 'funny' moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to out do the last one the themes of working together which should have been present at the end were nonexistent instead people get the impression well i'll take this all upon myself and in this case i was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge all the moments similar to the lion king as mentioned below were beyond corniness even for a kid's movie br br and the worst of all it parallels the lion king in every single way responsible father figure who is killed by coyotes the coyotes are essentially the hyenas with the lead coyote being the equivalent of scar the farm falls into chaos the cow though basically simba wants to play around and is shocked that his dad died believes it was his fault even though in this movie it was his fault confronts the coyotes and gets an ass whooping after which tells him to leave and on the verge of leaving somehow decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up by complete surprise of course he leaves without knowing they will come help him br br other things taken from lion king stars moving around as signs father figures referring to stars signs in a mystical loving way the obviously of how the father ben found and took care of him and how at the end love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience birth at the end good god what the hell and even similar type music which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music br br honestly this is the first movie i have ever seen where i really was rooting for the bad guys i never understood what other people were saying until now br br bottom line don't waste your time to go see this convince the kids not to see it and re watch the lion king either that or take them to see the ant bully which was creative and artistic
<START> the new twenty is one of the worst films i have ever seen yes some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse but i would argue that a pseudo intellectual anti formulaic indie film that pretends to be more is worse br br the new twenty was written and directed by chris mason johnson and i will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that i wasted on his film br br the screenplay characters br br from beginning to end the screenplay failed to provide an anti hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail br br in story telling the three dramatic conflicts are man vs man man vs the world and man vs himself br br the screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in new york and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs himself where each of the film's characters are so self absorbed in a stupor of depression and self destructive behavior that the movie before the audiences very eyes br br each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict a fiancÃ©e who has sex with her fiancÃ©e's boss investor even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character a man who begins as a decent guy but is attracted to a foul mouthed investor and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul mouthed business jackass a closeted chubby gay cyber geek who does nothing but find dates online and a gay asian man who dates an hiv positive older man but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops br br crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction the suffering and self loathing of the fiancÃ©e that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a gordon gecko type character and become a jackass a story line for the chubby cyber geek and more scenes of interaction between the asian man and hiv positive boyfriend are all missing br br without proper establishing details all of the characters' actions seem forced and contrived br br direction cinematography score br br i found mr johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view leaving the actors emotionally incoherent br br the cinematography can be described as mundane at best mr johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of new york city this failure created a claustrophobic film that viewed like the filming of a stage play and not a film br br the score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film i assume that mr johnson is to blame since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot br br conclusion br br the new twenty is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film making
<START> this film is far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe br br it really is that bad br br personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film and rented this one thinking it would be one of those to my immense disappointment it was not br br the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off placards the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera i couldn't even finish watching it it is even worse than witch academy and that's quite a feat in itself br br i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release br br painful awful horrendous
<START> i absolutely love stand up comedy i love to hear the raw thoughts of the stand up on stage as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ing stupid that they had to share it with someone br br there used to be stand ups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to rodney dangerfield comes to mind or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others richard pryor and then there were the thought provoking comics like george carlin who despite pretending to be a loon was the smartest guy in the room who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around and realize just how screwed up things were and how easily they could change things br br now this might seem to not have anything to do with mind of mencia which as i agree with most commentators here is comedy central's horrid solution to the loss of chappelle's show but it does carlos mencia spends half of the show doing stand up bits for his audience sometimes on popular topics most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes he tries to be all three of the above types of stand ups he makes a stage character an every day mexican named carlos who despite stereotypes is just your run of the mill normal guy he then proceeds to try to laugh at others people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion and then finally he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer telling them that it will help them see his point of view br br carlos mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around laugh br br promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest yet easiest way to get laughs in stand up the best comedians which i fear carlos mencia feels he is in good company with don't have to resort to them they talk universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity rather than with it like mencia encourages as he creates more skits or real life situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it he tells us rather than asks us to laugh and actually presents these absurdities as truth rather than just extremes of it br br his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want something that as much as i hate to compare the two was chappelle's show's finest quality he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it which according to him is to make a stupid face and say dee dee dee this show is appropriately named it is indeed a show about the mind of mencia it's mencia's mind through and through and as such is nothing more than dumb entertainment the show is tailor made to give life lessons to its core audience 14 24 year olds about how stereotypes are bad but that racial bashing is alright to carlos mencia and therefore should be alright to you
<START> quai des takes too long getting going with clouzot so enamored of his back stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story however once it does it's clouzot at his best bertrand blier father of bertrand blier and co star of his buffet froid is the pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it not only that but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces not least when a thief steals his car at the murder sceneÂ br br the film really kicks into life with the arrival of luis jouvet's police inspector a rather wonderful creation half alistair sim in green for danger and half world weary with better dialog in a neat running gag his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal the police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes steve once revolutionary 80's us cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison br br if suzy is a rather unconvincing femme fatale the supporting cast more than compensate with the beautiful simone a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly mistaken for blier's lover by and other interested parties only jouvet similarly unlucky with women understands and genuinely sympathises with great black and white photography by armand this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly identifying in a police station trivia note pierre who played the playfully philosophical dr in le turns up in smaller roles as a cab driver in both quai and les br br the criterion dvd is quite superb great picture quality plus an illuminating extract from a french tv show featuring interviews with clouzot blier and
