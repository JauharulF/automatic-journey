<START> this is far the most worst film i've seen this year from bollywood so far i may not lie my wife liked this film very much it was not bobby deol or arjun what made this film become unbelievable but it was amisha patel she performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where luckily for her the hero arjun comes to rescue her in the middle of nowhere it amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain because she cannot see her environment from this scene i started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of amisha patel the way she plays a blind girl is very bad the only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with when i saw this film i respected rani mukherjee more with her performance in the movie black amisha will never reach this level in performing as an actress br br anyway she falls in love with arjun it is the clichÃ© story sudden arjun gets killed by a man who is madly in love with amisha amisha is in despair but then bobby enters the movie he also falls in love with the blind girl bobby deol is a great actor in my point of view but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where amisha patel buries it deep into the ground i must say bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far bobby grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him he was so bad in acting in barsaat but when you see him acting now you get the shivers and believe every word he says only a movie with high potential like a yash film has to meet his way br br okay when amisha also falls in love with bobby someones enters her life arjun is not dead who believes this crap i don't why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family singh or aryeman ramsay and give bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with amitabh bachchan i'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like bobby to give him a great role but he deserves so much better than a movie with amisha bigscreen t v face patel this movie was so awful that i regret buying it

<START> countless tv displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of today's mega stars plus hope davis's screen debut keep still in prudence the plot is about a non academic research of five medicine pursuing one's crazy idea on discovering the secret of death and learn what's after death then come back to life again yet the storyline hasn't been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot br br there are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen slasher script in there is nelson who creates the idea of decoding death pretty but introverted rachel david who cuts the knot on luckily not to be dismissed from the school ladies' man joe and finally the smart guy randy i did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be they join hands altogether in an experiment where nelson's heart will be stopped and then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus not long after nelson's experience everyone starts a race over having the wildest and the longest death experience risking their lives one by one yet soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had the visits to the afterlife brings back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories their deep subconscious they begin having delusions and visual hallucinations br br when the point comes where the explanation of subconscious director joel schumacher skips that every humankind has a subconscious personality which they are not aware of this inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss if you lose or if you this subconscious personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories i wanted to add this as a movie mistake which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier 90s' obviously here in this movie schumacher made the actors have it least affected then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson as if death is designed by god david had been introduced as an atheist now he turned out to believe in god when he recalled a flashback from his childhood after witnessing this 180 change in david it's clear to see that schumacher's film was so conservative and lily livered that's ultimately why it's never classified as a work of science fiction alas it had a good potential it even tried to tell the unconscious maturation from having a death experience beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it's only a part of a human's life br br more than what's in the movie it was also memorable to recall what's with the movie jan de bont as the cinematographer who had worked almost every time with schumacher creates an dreamy atmosphere like it's being an gothic horror movie the blue color schemes all over the walls reflecting into the actors' faces deliver first class of lighting that suits perfectly with the film the close up shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings catholic frescoes in the walls stop motion cameras and the dynamic camera speeds were all belong to bont's skills br br became a cult movie in time with its sociological pen portrait of the x generation juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically those were the times where fast paced and multi sequenced video music clips were on rise this style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer tony scott's the hunger 1983
<START> algiers is not a classic it is a perversion of the wonderful original pepe le moko directed by duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming pepe jean gabin if you want to fully experience the and the characters in algiers i recommend you don't even watch this movie and see pepe le moko instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clichÃ©d and the characters adhere much more to reality furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to pepe's character that you'll find the algiers version intolerable although algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters plus the wardrobe is truly breath taking in all scenes particularly pepe's in the last scene and at all times but also when she's on the boat frankly algiers is cheap as far as imitations go
<START> this review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box so if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it except that i like it a lot stop here br br the production values are not first rate but the acting between the leads is and they give the romance between them more life than does in his novel although i generally prefer the novel my very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs down some of the relationships with secondary characters and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device all this is handled much better in the book with the result that i find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie
<START> to even say that this film is work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man sebastien is a pathetic foolish not amusing at best yet highly popular host on french television if watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being his first ans lets hope only film proved to be even worst apology of rape the victim fall in love with her aggressor is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable i highly suggest you not to bother taking a look at this picture or any of future features you would just loose your time there is something about french television that don't smell right and this is patrick sebastien
<START> hallelujah a true colombian film crosses the border s to shows how and colombia really are i am an american of colombian and french heritage sick and tired of seeing colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by hollywood and others br br how many of you are aware that colombia is the second oldest uninterrupted democracy in the world after the usa or that it has a vibrant film and television industry to say nothing of ugly betty that it's capital bogota pop 9 million is the world capital of the book or that this beautiful city is host to the world's largest international theatre festival i hope that doug liman simon mr mrs smith robert zemeckis diane thomas romancing the stone one day visit to see how wonderful it really is and focus on cultural vitality and diversity instead of producing films such as maria full of grace from which joshua profited greatly for this terrific film without ever thinking through about the damage his film would help to perpetuate upon the unfairly tarnished image of colombia br br anyway you will at least enjoy bluff very much oh and thanks imdb for your invaluable great work
<START> look don't get me wrong i love independent films but come on i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f ing nightmare i am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked the acting was crap br br i am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one this one didn't even try please don't waste your precious time and money i am sorry to be so harsh but come on it dragged on and and on and on remember when the kids got into that party with the weird and the watermelon martinis how did they just blend in it made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a meaningful conversation with whoever they wanted i know im but my mind is just buzzing with everything i hated about this film
<START> it only took one viewing of this dog for me to say never again it's so profoundly unmemorable that i had to read other people's reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond 1 it was awful 2 connery should have quit while he was ahead and 3 the film included a total gross out bit involving faking a scan through the most gruesome not to mention horribly inefficient means possible br br actually i've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of connery's bond films over even the worst moore or dalton outings or brosnan or even david niven for that matter i personally found octopussy and moonraker among other canonical bond films to be far more entertaining than this and probably for the very same reasons why others the moore bond films namely their wry humor and their willingness to surrender to the of the whole basic bond milieu
<START> i'm a fan of the old sctv show from the late 70's and early 80's and john candy was a major reason why he was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies time after time i was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the straight role instead of the funny guy armed and dangerous rarely tries to use john's comedic abilities or that of harold ramis for that matter it is simply a very predictable cops and robbers type of movie if you are a john candy or harold ramis fan the movie is watchable just don't expect to laugh much
<START> i loved this show such talent and i am so disappointed that it is canceled after only just beginning i looked forward to this show all week long and so sorry for the people who were hoping to be the one i would have loved to see who would have won it just began and in my opinion it should not have been canceled i hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts and have the opportunity to reach their goals i voted and sat waiting for it to come on never knowing that it was canceled and i could not believe that it was i am amazed that it had low ratings because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on tv
<START> another hand held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about br br imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie it's another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared br br i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends but the creepy moments the genuinely creepy moments were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent revelations appeared throughout so i certainly can't recommend this as highly as rec br br having said that it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about worms contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down br br check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand held genre releases of late and the finale is a hair raising doozy br br see this if you like the last broadcast pulse angel heart
<START> duncan roy's writing and direction is really and regularly below par actually it sort of stinks aka is almost as bad as his recent horrible self serving remake of dorian gray absurd contorted dialogue among the 'upper characters at once idiotic and pretentious amateurish stilted to its core and script and sometimes the acting is creaky like a school play but worse there's a sort of peacock self certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped he's just no good diana quick must be cringing with embarrassment dr you should just get out of film seriously
<START> wealthy businessman's daughter who as a young girl caught fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath discovers her marriage to a charming ne'er do well was arranged by daddy whom she affectionately refers to as darling worse than that she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic rival pure bunk paul screenplay via jerome thin story trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot which submerges the already soapy scenario in grim talk why go backwards when we can figure out what's happening for ourselves this is a woman's weeper with no faith in its target audience so simplistic is the set up dorothy mcguire swathed in furs for most of the picture isn't a canny clever heroine at all when she's upset she turns inward and stony upon realizing her marriage is basically a sham she shrinks away from her husband like the consummate virgin well that's a possibility she and van johnson sleep in separate beds after all ruth roman has the film's best moments as a society shark with her trap set for van but what exactly do these women see in him johnson can be charming when it's required but put him in a melodramatic setting and he goes stony too mgm production values only so so however director gottfried tries adding some visual flavor to the flashback segues and he attempts a lively pacing for the movie's initial half hour from
<START> i think i would probably not hate this movie if i spoke polish i selected the english version at the first menu but it gave me polish dialogue with english subtitles just as the polish version did maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into english very well to exacerbate the issue some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all the acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything one scene that bothered me was when a german woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around her shirt opened and the director showed close ups of her naked breast for the next 15 20 seconds i couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the americans first the american uniforms did not look anything like u s army uniforms second none of the extermination camps in poland were liberated by the americans i would think that a polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an american born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the russians all in all it's just not a very good film if you don't speak polish
