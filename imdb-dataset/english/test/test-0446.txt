<START> howard brackett kevin kline is a teacher who is about to get married then one of his former students wins an oscar for a film in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks howard in his acceptance speech outing him as being gay too this film follows the aftermath as reporters descend on howard's village and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight br br i love this movie kevin kline is wonderful it has some really hilarious moments and it always leaves me feeling great with an enormous grin on my face consequently it's one film that i enjoy watching as often as possible if you haven't seen it you're missing out
<START> in one of the many bugs bunny daffy duck cartoons elmer fudd is out hunting and daffy tries to get him to shoot bugs needless to say bugs has his own agenda moreover rabbit seasoning makes interesting use of word order and warning it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech br br i think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by bugs and daffy one of them seems like it would have been risquÃ© for 1952 especially in a cartoon but they pull it off perfectly as they always did all in all this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were
<START> destroy all planets winds up settling for all by film's end as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls to the reptilian furnace known as gamera actually gamera is saving earth right from the get go knocking out space ship 1 even before the first set of film credits roll the scene switches to a japanese scout camp where we meet a pair of meddlesome young heroes jim and who take part in gamera's exploits after being kidnapped by the aliens and beamed aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield br br it's pretty startling to see the boys convince a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that might be defective previously boy genius had wired the unit to run in reverse direction of it's controls but dr dobie didn't think about checking that out as a possibility at least that prepared the boys for interfering with the alien space ship's controls by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks br br when boss alien says the hang on to your seats for rehashed footage from earlier gamera movies where he battles and gyaos these take up quite a bit of screen time but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to get on with it for the longest time addressed an invisible crew and when they finally appeared they were orientals who could fly imagine that br br seeing as how these movies were made for a juvenile audience it's surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are gamera drawing blood comes to mind and how about the pair of space crew members being decapitated when squid tentacles started emerging from the headless bodies i made a connection to the 'alien' films having the individual units merge to form the giant was a neat device br br i guess the appeal for young kids might reside in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster move around pretty freely on an alien space ship and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien telepathy technology seeing as how the movie was presumably made by adults it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment
<START> this documentary is absolutely fantastic i was really astonished that you can make with so less money such amazing fx especially the scenes of the birth of the babies or the sad story of the big flying dinosaur were wonderful and breathtaking well the only flaw was it was to short
<START> i normally like casper in his movies a real credit to starship troopers but the box cover on this video ssooooo mi the renters at my local video people rent it expecting a perhaps borg like vampire and instead they get a bad re make of lon chaney it had great potential and fell very flat ireally think i could have written a better story line and screen play why is it in every science fiction movie they the cast constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy didn't any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class it is a pet of mine but a solar system is a single star with planets a galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs makes it sound even dumber
<START> like most other reviewers i really enjoyed this tv miniseries i didn't see it when it first came out but my grandfather a big fan of mysteries and war films happened to record it in 1989 i remember watching it at my grandparents' cabin one night and i was completely drawn into the story it has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama romance and espionage i've seen lots of films that are set during wwii but none with a twist like this thankfully i was able to make a vhs copy of the film several years ago i've watched it several times since then and i still enjoy it i would love for this film to be released on dvd it would be so much easier to view with chapters
<START> i first rented this movie on the infamous day of september 11 2001 since then i've seen it a number of times my only complaint is that it's too short would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours as it stands the running time is only an hour and a half br br ex twisted sister member dee snider wrote produced and stars in this 1998 set in a small colorado town he plays carleton a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for near death experiences is no pushover he's a pumped up six foot modern primitive someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme when he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sight br br main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings with his kidnapped victims he visits internet chatrooms under the name capt howdy and then invites people over to his house they believe they're going to a party instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body if it sounds sick it's because it is br br one of victims is genevieve the teenaged daughter of detective michael gage gage not only manages to save her but arrests as well four years later is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community a group of rednecks led by freddy krueger himself actor robert englund decide to kill him they fail and reverts back to his old self br br the rest of the film i'll leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers with the exception of snider the acting isn't too good but it's serviceable the direction is okay too there are some humorous parts in and they are very funny i also loved the soundtrack it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock overall this is a movie worth watching if you love low budget horror films with a sense of humor check it out you'll probably like it
<START> undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever balance of terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense with intelligent real world parallels the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the us and the soviet union during the cold war spot on characterizations and the introduction of star trek's second most important hostile alien race after the klingons the romulans br br after receiving a distress call from a federation outpost the enterprise is dangerously close to the neutral zone which if crossed would lead to open conflict with the romulans although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh soon enough a vessel appears carrying a new weapon and a device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat facing the threat of imminent annihilation kirk must engage in a battle of wits with the commander mark to ensure the survival of his crew unfortunately the task is made more difficult when one of the men accuses spock of being in league with the enemy due to the physical resemblance between romulans and vulcans two races that are in fact related a fact that is quite ironic with hindsight given went on to play spock's father starting with season 2 br br always very critical when it came to the subject of war star trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and tense take on the topic although the romulans aren't actually based on the soviets the name is actually taken from romulus the founder of rome the scenario is quite obviously inspired by the very vivid fear american and russian citizens had at the time that either nation might be able to destroy the other with nuclear weapons that fear gave birth to the titular concept of balance of terror but even without the subtext this remains an essential episode due for the most part to the intellectual battle between the two adversaries which translates into a duel between shatner and no need to say who wins
<START> this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other henry may long is a very well acted dimly lit depressing turn of the century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy indebted junkie talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea and all the crying wears thin recommended if you like independent slyly intellectual slow paced merchant ivory type features br br i suspected that the main characters were in love but their connection was so intimated it didn't really have the emotional impact of mountain ' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life but it is truly a dark and depressing film
<START> this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever guest is truly talented he has a gift for humor i almost died laughing actually when i saw this in theaters i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb but it is dumb in a good way it is funny dumb and this is a really good combination you will be laughing from start to end br br this mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show the cast includes parker posey fred willard eugene levy catherine o'hara john michael michael larry miller bob balaban jennifer coolidge and tons more br br this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing someone born without a personality would laugh at this film it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity best in show 5 5
<START> it is very possible that i simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me something similar happened with triplets of belleville but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate an exchange student from japan immediately started laughing at the movie saying that it sounded dumb now i don't agree that it is dumb the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled it's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time br br but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me it has an interesting message about and greed but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning especially because you already knew it anyway the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling and cherry pits for example are indeed repulsive br br there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the out of his scalp but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it br br as i said about triplets of belleville this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim or its japanese counterpart but an academy award nominated film it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from
<START> witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense but who cares when linda blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who can't seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewn shut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers re opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady Â an aging actress or something who always dresses in black Â starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin off of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried
<START> well i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a dvd copy as a birthday for my dad the film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages much better than anything disney ever made in my opinion and i used to work in the disney store the characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding especially the musical talents of swat the fly and smack the mosquito and the amazing night club scene the musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby sitting and in fact every child i know thanks to my loving parents have seen this film many times it will always get top marks for its fabulous love story a brilliant baddy and over all originality
<START> i saw on a night i couldn't sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the is a great advertisement for teaching and for simply helping each other set in the early 60s with the civil rights issues viet nam and all that came with the 60s it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power's that be the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves maybe hopefully see this film
<START> than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie what was the motive the details of the murders were used but never explained i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere which is great but the story is definitely lacking there is no thread to follow i guess if that was done properly the movie would've lasted a bit longer but it would've been worth it at least for me br br casting is very good i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky br br not much more to say really but i really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious br br
