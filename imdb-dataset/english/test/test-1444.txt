<START> i usually don't write reviews for shows unless i've seen them in full however there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism br br this show is hysterically bad i don't think it was meant to be but it is i see that there's lots of praise being showered upon the show and i honestly can't understand why this show is so poorly acted the dialogue is so awful and the plots are thin around their holes br br i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards some elements of the show work and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me br br if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it anticipating clichÃ©d lines and such this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule if you have that sort of time on your hands br br the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show if the nonsense saccharin clichÃ© ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock then this may be a show for you
<START> there's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'murder by numers' because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll there's no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra bullock and ben chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on although bullock is strong in her role it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'birthday girl' as well as chris penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well it's too bad they weren't in a much better all around film barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks
<START> directed by the same jin that put and com a once promising online film community temporarily out of business and off the net because of his directorial style and method of filmmaking on his next film girl's best friend br br the hole suffers from this look at me i am a filmmaker style of filmmaking that is becoming the near standard in today's hollywood to the detriment of content br br the hole actually starts out with a unique concept but that concept and the promise of captivating content soon is destroyed by the look at me directorial style of filmmaking br br there are some funny moments that still shine through the pretense but it is a painful short to watch br br how sad it is when the new breed of filmmakers choose not to be a servant to the story but rather try and dominant on and off screen heck they don't care as long as they get their studio deal house on the beach and a new car content and presentation are secondary issues br br the real sad part of all this is hollywood embraces the look at me attitude so much that the whole aesthetic of filmmaking is changing rather than present a story in a straightforward way that puts the story first today's directors are getting experimental i e look at me br br is it me or am i the only one that was really put off by opening minutes of swordfish that movie went on to rise above directorial attempts at look at me filmmaking unfortunately this short film by mr does not br br 3 out of 10 rating from tv
<START> i have to admit that i approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread louis de bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100 faithful br br all the way through i found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant the ending however is much better than that in the novel and i could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards still the john magnificent cinematography stephen warbeck's great score etc i felt did not outweigh my initial negatives cage's miscasting a heavily diluted script br br but two days later i was queuing again to see and although not perfect i have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de was concerned was not a fully rounded character his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on and complements the superb double act of penelope cruz and john hurt perfectly david morrissey is quietly effective as weber the nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him and the fine greco italian supporting cast bring de world of dazzlingly alive br br on leaving the cinema second time around i finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of ww2 in cinematic terms my hat goes off to john madden who despite the almost expected critical he is receiving from the british critics any director who has had a major success like shakespeare in love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart verve and humanity the core virtues of the novel in fact that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now br br if you are a fan of the book like me it's hard but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing try to erase the book from your mind for two hours bathe yourself in the glorious mediterranean atmosphere and discover dr as if for the first time pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay and i guarantee you won't be disappointed br br in fact you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or dvd br br 8 10
<START> enjoy the opening credits they're the best thing about this second rate but inoffensive time killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove the main part however goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who nevertheless occasionally manages to project a rooster kind of the first time we see him he's bare chested sweaty and engaged in that favorite beefcake activity chopping wood after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in lethal weapon he could use a better script however since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing there's also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained there are a few pluses though sending john woodrow undercover as john wilson is an amusing play on a presidential name and co star jody ross nolan shows promise as an inmate who early in the proceedings is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard one final note the movie's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of extras despite the impressive size of the prison it only seems to hold about 12 inmates note the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful for the record the burly bald headed guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill and the young fair haired guard who electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc
<START> this indie film is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators wallace and marsha forbes mr has directed the young cast and he is to be praised for this effort br br the premise of the film is a cautionary tale of the danger for wanting something one can't have which is the story of alice and ed after living together for a while alice suddenly gets restless because she imagines she's lacking experience in the sex area alice and ed's relationship while not an example of ideal happiness is a comfortable way to share their lives with one another that is until the moment alice and claire her sister happened to bump into a sexual encounter by another couple that has no clue of being observed br br this incident makes alice reevaluate her own sexual life with ed she finds it lacks substance when she proposes other people' ed is shocked to put it mildly but not wanting to contradict alice he decides to go along what happens next is that both alice and ed enter into a world that's been unknown to them the people they meet in the end are not worth the trouble they sadly realize at the end they were made for each other br br the film is worth watching in order to see the amazing julianne nicholson who we happen to have liked in another indie film tully ms nicholson reminds us of a young shirley she projects such a luminous quality about her that is hard to take one's eyes from her whenever she is in a scene this young actress proves she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new appearance basically she carries the movie her alice is a study in contrasts alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing ed because of her inexperience br br jay mohr is an excellent match for ms nicholson both do wonders together his ed is perfectly credible we have known people like him deep down inside he is a good person who suddenly gets himself in a situation he didn't call for yet he goes along only to discover he is too decent and not cut out for a life of gratuitous sex with the willing women that have no problem with a tumble in the hay just for fun br br the rest of the cast is wonderful lauren graham does some amazing work as claire alice's yuppie sister andy is also wonderful as the grounded carl the nerdy friend who finally finds out fulfillment when he meets penelope a single mother as penelope helen slater makes a albeit of a short appearance in the film br br the director is enormously gifted who will no doubt go places because he shows he is well suited for the job
<START> i love old monster movies for the pure camp value this one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing br br the acting is pure 1950s stilted crap you do get used to it when you've seen enough of these the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable you're just there for the giant bird br br the science in this movie is hilarious a monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti matter intent on wreaking havoc and eating people an alien who has come to earth to nest some of the best scenes in the movie that don't have the bird in them include the scientists explaining what is going on br br a lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette it looks like a new baby bird bald and ugly with ruffled feathers it even like a hungry angry fledgling however the bird scared the crap out of my three year old who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening it's a bit creepy br br i was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield but i'm a bird lover what can i say
<START> i think hollywood should seriously consider never doing another biblical film again if noah's ark is going to be the norm aside from the horrible completely uninspired acting from the whole cast voight and steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film the time line has been completely rearranged i also missed the part in genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat hello everyone else was dead except for noah and his family according to scripture god stacked lumber and added plans to build the ark when noah questioned how i also don't remember reading anything about noah's wife constantly nagging him during the 40 days or noah wandering around glassy eyed and dazed all the time the script writer obviously had very little knowledge of the book of genesis or just didn't care that his abomination of a story completely mocked it
<START> nicely done evil little comedy pitting the fbi against organized crime with a nice lady caught in the middle the actress who played the jealous wife of the mob boss the tiger' almost stole the show with her raging tantrums 3 stars
<START> so you have the spoiler warning but i would argue that you cannot spoil what is already rotten i assume they changed the name to the cavern just in case within s reputation had preceded it br br after paying the cable rental for this movie i considered saving my household garbage for a month and mailing it to the writer director he had his garbage delivered to my home so i thought it only fair that i return the favor br br the movie opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of kazakhstan i'm not sure why they picked kazakhstan maybe the writer is a fan of the ali g show but they should have just started inside the cave because the outside was obviously not kazakhstan it was the first clue that i was going to hate the movie br br the movie has no redeeming qualities save one it's consistent everything is terrible the writing the directing the acting the cinematography every aspect of this film is just bad and i like bad films goofy films b horror films but this was just plain bad and stupid and hackneyed and predictable and boring br br to get a feel for the film go into your laundry room with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights put a flashlight turned on into your dryer and start it tumbling now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs that's it br br for a complete re enactment have 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room play dead on the floor toss karo syrup on them turn the lights back on stop the dryer now have a guy in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standing br br fin br br addendum reading through the other comments many find it remarkable this movie was made on a low budget that's not remarkable making a crap movie on a huge budget is remarkable waterworld making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable like blair witch which i thoroughly enjoyed making a crap movie on a low budget isn't a bit surprising and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies because i can't imagine anybody would hand them a pile of cash after watching this br br is the low budget an excuse for a terrible film no and it's certainly no reason to watch it would you eat a dog dung sandwich just because it was cheap to make br br the imdb rating for this film over time will be interesting to watch it should trend farther downward but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can the movie makers' ability to beg their personal friends to give it 10 stars
<START> this homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by edgar allan poe the local police have bungled the case for a few years so now the fbi has taken over they know exactly who the guy is but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house because that's where he's hanging out running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals so fbi chick gets kidnapped which involves her father the former lead investigator from the local police to top it all off a pack of wacky college kids have decided to camp out at the house and smoke a bunch of weed br br mostly the fbi agent winds up shrieking and running around like a little girl and not a single one of the burly college boys thinks to just stop and take a swing at the wimpy poe boy mostly overacted and sometimes underacted dead end road reeks of a low budget cast with friends production that has silly points too numerous to cover
<START> anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside puff a couple great story br br reality is for people who can't handle drugs
<START> a 2006 online poll of japan's top 100 favorite animated television series of all time conducted by tv placed this series in fourth place that tells you everything you need to know so go and watch it i won't comment on the story simply because i don't want to ruin anything i only urge you to keep watching after you saw the first episode the animation is really good and above tv average the best thing about this series is that there is finally something new i mean it's not groundbreaking but still it offers a fresh new idea and likable characters you won't regret entering world br br and the best thing a movie is coming soon
<START> the movie starts off promisingly enough the use of imagery and simple short clips convey the bigger story which would normally need a considerably higher budget than the one here however it did start to worry me as it continued combined with another overly husky max payne type voice over the movie was starting to look not so good i hoped it was just the introduction to the story br br the story is what really caught me and took me to this movie the idea that a research scientist has created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from other infection was an interesting scientific idea then that subjects who had the most bizarre disorders sought out the scientist and offered to be his human experiments made me think this could be one very good small movie yet the introduction hadn't gone well br br there did seem to be a change of pace as the movie turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the movie the test subjects although the acting wasn't superb there seemed to be a lot of scope for character development throughout the movie and the recordings were done quite well with a varied mix of characters however these faded through the movie they weren't used again after a few brief clips and i did feel that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development by reflecting back to them however it wasn't to be br br the imagery becomes increasingly disconnected from the story often repeating to represent something that is still happening this and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting commentary it began reciting words one after the other short meaningless sentences and reciting none too relevant or interesting scientific ramblings if there was something to be described four or five words would be used it was too long repetitive circular looping you're getting the idea br br now this could have been to reflect the confusion and of the character slowly becoming caught up in his own thoughts rambling due to lack of food and water what it actually did was to cause me to totally switch off to the voice and by the closing stages of the movie i found that i hadn't been listening to some of the ramblings br br a number of times that an event occurs the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful there are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene for instance a character sleeping fades to black then fades back in on the character sleeping again look we know the character is asleep we know time has passed please move on overall there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long hanging shots to fill time br br the acting was not bad and the characters were okay but not exploited and developed when they were interacting there were some truly cringeworthy moments for example when one of them asks if they are hungry the camera looks to each of them and returns to a group shot they pause look to each other turn back to camera and say slowly no it raised a snigger or two their dialogue was slow glossy and either it was missing altogether or totally unnecessary there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue hit spot on br br however there were some good scenes but they were really hard to find unless you viewed them in isolation and this is what it almost looks like has happened with this movie the film has been looked at as a series of scenes and not as a complete story br br nowhere is this seen more than in the main storyline the characters are infected with the virus that has been killing the animals the one that was being engineered for them we're told that it develops in stages to something dramatic and so that is what we expect what we get are the characters eating loads together all throwing up once together water pouring from their mouths in unconvincing streams then they all fall asleep these are the phases which all happen really early in the movie then they all say good together when asked how they are and that's it that's the virus done nothing else happens br br there could have been so much more done with this movie so much more developed with the virus and it protecting them from all manner of harm it could have explored a serious change of these characters as it infected and took over them it could have developed these characters shown them making decisions and doing things that connect back to their character shown in flashbacks to the interviews br br the ending isn't even confusing intriguing or thought provoking it just shows something that happens and that's it although in the long drawn out style with the irritating voice over above it i really struggled with this movie and watched a number of press members walk out including one famous tv critic leaving within the first twenty minutes i stayed but regretted the lost time
<START> please if anybody gets the chance to read this before watching the movie if it can be called so refrain from it do not waste your time i too watched this film right after finishing the book and was seriously disappointed the main character is basically a new made up fanny for she shows no resemblance ever to the book she's so lively and laughing all the time if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy introverted character please all the most important parts of the story which are supposed to convey to the ending are simply not taken into account and the rest made up i think one is better off using the time to either read a little bit of the actual novel or simply do nothing
