<START> this film was made right in the area where i grew up and now live i know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film as a teenager i worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with ron perlman jonathon and the car i am told that jonathon and ben allison are are natives of nc i was fortunate to see it at a local showing at that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props such as the bus 1938 greyhound used in the movie the bus had no reverse gear and during filming the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me the film accurately depicts life in this area during wwii a well done film and i anxiously await the dvd availability
<START> michelle pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent a lighthearted demme film with some good laughs and pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun with on a scale of one to ten 8
<START> best in show tracks the stories of a handful of human contestants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows in the calendar any amateur psychologist would say that an unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life and each of the characters in some way fills this cliche there's the former high school hottie who's now married to a geeky man the childless label obsessed yuppie couple the solitary outdoorsman the young wife of a wealthy old codger along with her short haired dog trainer and the gay couple br br what makes this film so funny though is the way it these stereotypes in a completely believable way almost affectionate in many cases every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says with their dog as an innocent onlooker seems like the kind of behaviour you'd totally expect to see at a dog show br br the biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all american style sports announcer comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game and his english canine academic foil br br the trials of the geeky husband as his blonde wife meets an astonishing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle as is the demented behaviour of the yuppie couple as the pressure builds while their hound stays completely br br well worth watching even if cats are more your bag
<START> i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his death acting was a little over the top but as its jeremy brett i didn't mind br br this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar novel very closely if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch an ideal husband with jeremy brett as lord goring br br this film gives a great insight into oscar way of thinking and while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way dorian grey is lord alfred douglas and basil is oscar wilde
<START> this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago they have all met for a reunion terry plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent d'onofrio as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money cockiness tony shalhoub is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary sinise plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way it's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other it's not the best movie i've seen but it's certainly good enough for a viewing
<START> i accidentally happened upon this movie when i was looking for something to watch while eating lunch i actually turned to the we network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of sticking it for some gymnastics team i figured cheesy goodness well i got cheesy alright br br first i missed a good 20 40 minutes at the start of the movie luckily most of it was fairly quickly especially in the bedroom scene where crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist br br i love jenny garth and will watch her in just about anything she's just so pretty and i want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always does she looks great throughout this movie and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade br br overall i felt bad for the actors as i watched this movie all of them tried to sell their parts but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle frankly i was surprised to see terry farrell and mitch ryan greg's dad from dharma greg in this br br but the writing was not the worst part of this movie about a half hour before the end her mother dies and when they show the headstone the death date is 1979 having missed the beginning i had gotten the impression from the wardrobe that this was taking place in the 80s not one leisure suit or bell bottom in sight shame on the person who did wardrobe for this film don't get me wrong all the outfits in this movie were beautiful but they were completely wrong for the time period it almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece br br bottom line good for a laugh or to feed a jennie garth fix
<START> ok this 'horror' film was meant to be a joke right please tell me it was supposed to be a joke then i'll understand br br a big cawing bird with giant claws or one claw anyway swoops down on unsuspecting folks on the ground and gobbles them up mara and jeff morrow sufficiently overact in order to keep things interesting but at least you'll enjoy a hearty snicker when you see the 'monster' it looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and mortimer br br either director fred sears just made this picture in a hurry and knew the bird looked utterly ridiculous or he really thought his film and creature were genuinely frightening i prefer to think and hope it was the former br br p s the bird needs a haircut
<START> i thought i was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie but at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of sen i decided to turn up for the movie going at this cheap theater really bothered me cos i had seen king kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town the movie starts of and surprisingly i wasn't complaining br br a great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma's part shabana azmi a divorcÃ©e who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister konkona sen sharma a schizophrenic spare me the spelling who imagines thing all the time rahul also gives a stellar performance br br the story is that sen sharma is a schizophrenic and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter her levels really increase her fiancÃ©e leaves her for the person she became in all her world comes down upon her shabana azmi her elder step sister takes care of her and in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fiancÃ©e has 5 children and they stay in 15th park avenue which really is a place in new york the plot goes on as becomes suicidal as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband as fate would have and her fiancÃ©e meet up when they both are out on a trip 11 years after the brutal rape her fiancÃ©e has no existence in her real world she cant recognize him her fiancÃ©e now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to park avenue and he does he takes her to a place in which supposedly looks like her husband's home as jojo rahul her fiancÃ©e is talking on his cell phone he loses track of everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found she finally gets what was denied to her her family her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th park avenue br br i must say that it touched my heart i myself am now a fan of sen's direction the camera work is superb and the quality of performance is spell bounding konkona sen sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child shabana azmi gives another mind blowing role as the divorcÃ©e elder sister who has the load of keeping the family rahul another neat and quiet role i don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks he has so much potential lastly sen she still captivates the audience even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it br br a very well deserved 8 10
<START> this satire is just really really dead on and nobody is spared but even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of hitler here cleverly renamed as and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo german the general tone is pretty sad maybe because of the movie's place in history and the actors aren't even exaggerating that much i suppose one of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the jewish ending speech if only things could have ended in that way it's not even really the character talking anymore it's chaplin saying something he really wanted to say if you ignore the technical aspects the movie doesn't feel dated or old it actually moves at a pretty nice pace and the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die the only thing i don't care for is the slapstick but that just comes with the era i suppose this is an incredibly daring harsh take on fascism it's so hard hitting still after all these years
<START> the title comes from an alteration an adolescent inmate in a correctional facility makes on the front cover of his school book on government titled the united states he adds of his name br br many characterizations in this movie work well the scenes between leland ryan gosling and becky jena malone pearl don cheadle and father fitzgerald spacey as well as with leland becky and sister julie michelle williams among many others br br but the central thread of this movie the on which everything hangs is the character and motives of leland he's a somewhat shy passive nice high school student who daringly introduces himself to becky whom we find is going to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems in becky's family she has a sister julie who's just graduating from high school and preparing to go on to college julie's boy friend julie's age and whose parents' had recently died is also living with them br br leland lives with his mother his father kevin spacey and mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous novelist leland is very perceptive the young boy in the sixth sense saw dead people leland sees teenage lovers and recognizes that years later they will divorce that pain is going to follow many people's present experience of happiness but for reasons that are never made explicit his prescient gift seems to operate some times for some people some relationships and not for others br br parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative quilt borrowing from american beauty the sixth sense the graduate and possibly some others i didn't recognize that wouldn't be bad if only the character of leland worked br br i think gosling did a great job of playing leland but the script and the story imposed limitations would such an observant meditative young man ever be homicidal even for altruistic reasons nothing in the film gives a reason for this i'm a retired therapist with much experience working with families and teenagers while many of the reactions shown in the film work this part this most essential element certainly does not br br and there is at least one other element which in my experience would not fit with real life although it's not as critical the reason for the differences between the sisters becky and julie are never hinted at but that's okay once two sibs begin occupying different roles one the all good girl the other the troubled one the roles themselves can begin driving each other to more extreme positions for the troubled one becky it's kind of what do i have to do to be loved around here give up being me and become julie and the pressure to live up to being the all good parent pleasing child is no less intense on julie so why would she break up with her boy friend of long standing and of whom her parents so obviously approve br br don cheadle was good as teacher all others were good in their parts 98 of the scenes were good what was missing was that crucial slip in understanding human nature br br good acting flawed story and psychology worth seeing not a total loss
<START> this film was different it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting in depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith of course it helped that the main performance by andrew mccarthy was quite excellent the other performances were also quite interesting although not as consistent the ending was a bit of a let down but there were lots of good moments the film makers tried something different here they didn't just go for the obvious chills and scares this is a dark film not for everyone but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to try this one
<START> i am probably a little too old for this movie 16 and being a guy the story is a little too girlie but i really thought it was a cool movie overall all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses from alana to adrianne to to kimberly all the way down to the cute girl that plays little sister rachel i am not a huge pop star fan with the lovesick songs but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this and seems like he was really into this movie and made it seem real my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with so that's cool too i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people and wonder if i will see them again a sequel would be cool i rented this but i might buy it too since i have a ton of dvd's and like to go back to see something that i missed i couldn't buy it at blockbuster though so i don't know where i could buy it right now but i'll look into that anyway i am a 16 year old guy i already said that i know but i would totally take a date to see this it's really good for all ages really i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this that's what is so cool about it that it is something that all ages can see i'm sure that was done on purpose but it really works girls can dream about being with aaron carter and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie there is something for everyone
<START> i'm not the biggest fan of westerns my two personal favorites though are unforgiven and tombstone this movie though i loved it was great the plot was well done and it was a fun movie everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent i even think it beat out both movies in someway well not really unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run i do think it beat out tombstone though both had its strong points for instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming but posse beat out tombstone in four ways in my opinion first the characters were more unique in posse the music was better in posse the idea was original in posse unlike wyatt earp and the biggest difference the action sequences oh my gosh posse was a western with really good action sequences i mean really good the action was fast paced like modern day based shoot'em up movies the action had big budget explosions too the fistfights were pretty good also mario van pebbles was great in this movie i suggest buying this excellent movie
<START> obviously the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who's on the crew i don't recall ever seeing a movie that's more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching in my 30 years of watching movies this is the only one i have ever walked out of bad humor bad jokes bad gags bad editing bad plot etc br br note to producer it's never funny to hunt humans based on race great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races but you're still hunting humans based on race and that's sickening
<START> i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it excellent their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet it's getting there it's definitely good br br first the good things the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who battlefield was aired br br one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who except when they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's however the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it's good it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws some of the stories dalek were very poor i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series br br aliens in london was by far probably the best episode so far it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including boomtown br br now the other bad things the companion rose billie piper isn't great she's actually quite annoying but as is dr who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part br br christopher eccleston is pretty respectable he's started to catch his niche he tried to play the character straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows br br continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back br br aside from that though the series overall is pretty good i haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series
