<START> has all the ingredients of a good joel schumacher film intelligent youthful characters stunning cinematography a gripping story and excellent performances it's escapist fun but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving br br schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things see the cast list their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average kiefer sutherland shines in his egotistical med student role br br the cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain which is what i love about schumacher his use of light and location create images that stick a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed reminded me of the lost boys br br this is a film that takes an awesome premise curious students want to find out what's after death and successfully follows it through into a scary gripping tale of redemption one of schumacher's best highly recommended
<START> movies just don't get worse than this horrible plot terribly timed pathetic characters and effects and yes this is using b standards br br and for the guys nothing this movie is a terrible let down couple scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but build up with no delivery br br this movie appeals to no one horrible movie it had bad plot acting b flavor special effects and everything else plus no nudity or for guys or the girls
<START> dean cain the one time super man plays max hooper the super thief he can break into any company and steal any thing for the right price unfortunately his latest heist ends him up in a high rise in which someone else has set a fire to hide their own attempts to steal the product now the thief finds himself having to be the hero rescuing everyone in the building unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the f b i c i a are outside waiting for max br br the movie is barely passable dean cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material but here he is saddled with a weak script and pretty poor direction
<START> when i first saw it 9 years ago when i was 9 i thought it stunk i'm 18 now and i still think it stinks i mean geez no special effects or anything it was boring and kinda anti climatic my cousin watched once and george takai sulu kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better but they kept cutting to the budget it would have been a great episode but it was a terrible movie
<START> comments must've been written on topsy turvy day because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth br br eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene in every way the chemistry between colbert and cooper could not have been finer supporting cast is superb br br writing and direction are magnificent br br like so many other comments on this board again i lament why can't films be like this anymore br br this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best folks
<START> then you will be a big fan of this movie its almost the same basic concept a nice mixture of music soul and drama i'll admit i was a little about seeing this movie i had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator but i am a big fan of samuel l jackson and i enjoyed hustle flow so i thought i would give it a chance br br i'm very glad that i did it turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man the story had heart and was very influential br br the music in this movie also added a nice touch craig brewer mixed his style from hustle flow into this movie except took a new spin and used the blues his musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by he also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes br br no doubt if you liked hustle flow you will love this movie and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this i give it a 9 out of 10 very interesting film and it is extremely under rated shame br br go out and rent this movie
<START> ten minutes of people spewing gallons of pink vomit recurring scenes of enormous piles of dog excrement need one say more
<START> i watched this film in a singapore theatre yesterday 4 february 2006 and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through br br ms sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds br br we have had hollywood movies on this subject such as one flew over the cuckoo's nest where jack nicholson carried away the honours since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and clearing some misconceptions about treatment in cuckoo's nest for example shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric but in 15 the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be br br the other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause for schizophrenia but scholars such as dr e fuller have emphasised that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots br br it is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical ailment and its advance can be checked if detected early even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective br br the same understanding shown by ms sen is evident in the way the actors play out their parts in keeping with the gravity of the theme the acting is controlled throughout with ms konkana sen sharma's evocative silences and eyes mirroring the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters br br like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending it leaves lot of questions hanging in terms of the plot br br has search ended why is she not found in no 15 were children actually playing when strode past the gates with her eyes sparkling with recognition can anyone sort out this jigsaw puzzle
<START> is it full moon tonight oh it doesn't matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug what was i thinking if its full moon tonight geez br br i really like this movie there's romance suspense horror and hot stuff i like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by jumping and catching her that was really cool the setting of this movie is in the city of love which is paris in france the cemetery scenes are nice it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls the scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool even they got me on that scenes his friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character sorry i forgot his name was really funny the actors did a good job plus the make up crews the part when they're all partying in an abandoned church i can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church that is still god's house i bought this movie long time ago and i do not regret buying it i'm a horror movie lover i give this movie 5 stars out of 6 for the people who are open and loves movies like this give it a try you might like it
<START> i was watching the beginning of this on a friday mid day while working at computer at home relaxing a bit after a hectic week and cleaning up some files and answering some communications got interrupted a couple of times so had trouble getting all the details straight although it's hardly a work of hitchcock proportions where missing a detail can through the whole story off kilter and besides it was not exactly an engrossing piece of work br br so during a commercial read the only prior comment here by 1 and pretty much can agree with its details br br not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly good but i'd like to catch on tape when run again rather than seeing it as aired so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first time br br give it a 3 because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters
<START> it's funny how time went by and never saw this movie 'till last week when i was like under a spell i saw it twice in a week and it still wasn't enough it's a great movie and i will love to see it again the story is great and it really moved me i would love to live such a story the actors are great the music too and you can dream about your own love story i just hope that someday i will find the opportunity to learn to dance like johnny and baby i feel like dance connects people and brings them together i think people should learn to dance it helps a lot especially in a relationship it's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body
<START> ok i have seen just about everything and some are considered classics that shouldn't be like all those halloween movies that suck crap or even steven king junk and some are considered just ok that are really great like carnival of souls and then some are just plain ignored like evil ed or pumpkin head and brain dead the bud cort one then some stick in your head once seen and never leave that's what this did to me and for my money this is much better than last house on the left last house was great till the ending then it blew chunks what kind of dummy is gonna give a blow job to someone who just killed their kids completely stupid go find the movie bully or even funny games if ya want realism and to be creep ed out but this damn thing stuck with me for years one cause chuck connors always was scary two tanya roberts is the best female victim ever three the chick being smothered in plaster still is one of the all time worst killings on film and 4th the telekinetic powers thing blew my mind and came totally unexpected not to mention the dummies wax figures puppets etc it should be right there with psycho last house texas chainsaw etc it's a classic and deservedly so
<START> i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here i saw the whole movie by fast forwarding and ended in 25 minutes though its a low budget movie it could have been made better br br the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately and why was the movie named crash landing when it was landed so well in such a bad climate br br without any acting all the characters where just moving or doing like kids br br and should not forget to comment on the joker the main hijacker who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy
<START> i saw the star of this movie on the daily show and thought i might tune in the movie premiered on comedy central then went into theaters oh vey br br this makes shakes the clown look like citizen kane avoid avoid avoid at all costs not one laugh not even a grin this movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes burst like the last of raiders i can't even think of a worse movie be it manos or ishtar as the pythons beckoned run away run away why did anyone green light this unless they used their own money the horror is that there is not one good line not one good joke and only one bad thing the making of this movie br br i feel that if made properly this would have been hilarious as it is i need a new pancreas for retching so loud damn anyone involved in this travesty
<START> i am not so old that i can't remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells br br from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades br br if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years ago this movie is worse it was not even funny by accident it is sad pathetic and a total waste of time may hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood
