<START> famed filmmaker werner herzog's fata morgana is breathtakingly unorthodox although characters appear in the film from time to time there is no actual story the film is also not an educational or historical documentary it's a film without an accompanying screenplay br br the film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative vo the combination of which overlays a long string of images from mostly though not exclusively the sahara desert some of the images are wonderfully odd and out of the ordinary the camera captures ghostly images or mirages optical illusions that and mesmerize br br this general cinematic trend is punctuated by occasional observational asides on serendipitous topics for example in one sequence a man wearing goggles gives us a mini tutorial on lizards and in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence a small room contains a man with dark goggles who sings in a voice that is totally distorted by the microphone he's using accompanied by an old lady who plays a punchy tune on an old piano neither the man nor the old lady seems to enjoy what they're doing how baroque br br fata morgana does have an underlying concept one that unites the wide assortment of strange images and eclectic sounds but that concept is so subtle so opaque that you'll never figure it out without help from this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense without that point of reference however the film can seem tedious and unending a pointless parade of random earthy images and esoteric narrative gibberish br br unapologetically redundant thematically baffling and cinematically heretical fata morgana will likely either make you swoon with delight or cause you to throw up you'll either latch on to the film's zen like qualities or be tempted to smash the dvd into a thousand pieces one thing that most viewers will agree on fata morgana is different
<START> i admit i was lured to this one from the hype and i didn't stop to consider the sources one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year 1999 shocking and a must have br br well i wasted my money but not all was bad in this movie they at least got the gore right as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time there is even a storyline kinda and that is about it br br but for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content but no exploiting we get gay sex sorta we have 3 inter racial babes maybe we have a psychotic vietnamese hooker nice back oral sex ok that made me wince and some female version of gene simmons i don't get that part we have an honest to goodness capone rates among the best of the actors in this film that is not a compliment and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to i don't know try to connect the vengeance random theme killing by jimmy boy to make the vietnamese psycho seem sane if nothing else this movie proves that the italians and the americans do not have a lock on this type of movie the latinos can make crap as well as the rest of them kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that overcame it and made a career for themselves
<START> you know as you get older you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger might have been because of your youth and inexperience case in point when i saw the godfather at age 14 i thought it was boring 20 years later its an incredible movie to me in other words i grew up and began to appreciate great movies br br so i rented dirty dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request as she loved it at age 14 and i hated it at the same age but i hoped because i was young and stupid at age 14 perhaps this would be a new experience for me so i sat down with her to watch hoping to be enlightened br br well the night after watching dirty dancing i feel a violation i feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest br br first patrick swayze plays a 20 year old but he looks like he is 35 and the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager wooing her with his dance moves really creepy br br anyway the movie is the clichÃ© plot where the wrong side of the tracks guy and the rich smart girl accidentally fall in love with each other of course their romance is fueled by the fact the rich girl can't dance a lick so the poor hero teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show or something like that br br but you guessed it the disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making this all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man br br even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered i didn't press her but i did smirk a little and put the godfather part ii in the dvd player
<START> don't you ever miss the good old days when disney actually made great movies that really moved you growing up with disney i always found myself being captivated by the characters every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie i remember friday nights and running to turn on the tv just to watch their newest movies susie q was one of my all time favorites i never forgot this movie even till this day when one mentions the song susie q i always remember the movie if anyone is thinking of watching this movie i promise you you will fall in love with it i don't think i will ever be able to forget it you will not regret watching it br br unfortunately it's sad to see disney movies such as the hannah montana movie come out what ever happened to disney
<START> i have a problem with the movie snobs who consider americans to be uncouth semi literates unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated europeans les francais les just about anybody from le to whom english is a foreign language if the humour in my father the hero is different from that in mon pere ce heros it is because the french sense of humour is different from that of the american not better not more clever just different if you think it is crass for hollywood to borrow from the french cinema just consider how much the french cinema has borrowed from hollywood in the first place where would belmondo and delon have been without bogart truffaut without hitchcock jerry lewis not known for his subtle and cerebral style is in france go figure monsieur depardieu is exceptionally good as the hapless divorced father of a precocious 14 year old daughter on holiday in the bahamas together unbeknowst to him she presents him to the other people at the hotel as her lover so as to make herself more interesting to a boy she has her eye on not surprisingly complications ensue there are to green card and cyrano de bergerac amusingly inserted and m depardieu goes along with it all very good naturedly he does a good maurice impression with thank heaven for little girls which is in fact funny and rather poignant as his audience all of whom believe him to be the lover of a 14 year old girl get up and leave two by two as he away blissfully unaware of what is happening when he turns round at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause the expression on his face is priceless without him the movie would be very average indeed with his huge shambling figure dominating the screen it is a lot of fun no pecs no six pack just a real proper human type being formidable
<START> it is not generally my practice to review movies that i dislike to any great degree however one or two times a year i temporarily set aside my rule to only comment on things i like to give a word of warning i find it more enjoyable to comment on something i like and boost it than i do shooting at bad movies but some movies cry out for the razor br br bilitis is one of them the cinematography isn't the only aspect that is blurry and out of focus here an almost indiscernible plot certainly incoherent if there even is one bad acting cheesy script and awful pacing those are its major problems br br understand i firmly believe that not all movies are created equal and films should be judged according to their category it is not reasonable to judge say beach blanket bingo against gone with the wind i judge bilitis against other movies in its weight class measured against movies like emmanuelle or secrets of a chambermaid it comes off very badly indeed even eye candy has to be entertaining and bilitis most definitely is not
<START> i try to catch this film each time it's shown on tv which happily is quite often but i keep forgetting to video it as it is i practically know the script by heart but that doesn't stop me having a good cry in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what's coming next it's such a lovely film well made well cast good photography i love it one of my top ten films
<START> i watched about an hour of this movie against my will and couldn't finish it i'd rate it as a 0 the writing was bad the plot predictable and one that's been done far too many times the most annoying part of this movie was the acting done by melody thomas scott this part did not call for someone appearing snobbish but she managed in every single scene i saw to look like a sour snob or someone who was about to spout something extremely sarcastic or cruel br br the two romances which seemed to develop into something serious almost upon the couples meeting was a bit too much br br i should know better than to watch made for tv movies if there is absolutely nothing on the telly and this is the only choice read a book
<START> meatballs works its way into conversations like no other movie especially during summer whether it's the song about the counselors in training or the cut downs or the inspirational rudy the rabbit or it just doesn't matter speech it pops up poor mickey morty who knows where he'd wake up next such a great snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non pc is really funny no matter who you are wheels and spaz are favorites as is the hot dog eating contest with the famous line what no mustard oh how many times i've reiterated that line and been the only one laughing thank you to the writers actors and directors applause applause
<START> i taped this on sundance and had no idea that it was a miike film i thought it was just another kung fu movie br br then i saw things like the dancing sax player br br who sounded like an oriental gato and i knew this had to be miike br br i missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see miike's credits br br so far he hasn't disappointed me yet audition city of lost souls ichi the killer and the happiness of the were all good flicks and now i've found out that this was the third in a trilogy br br other than miike and todd there's nobody making interesting films nowadays
<START> what can i say about this band i was hooked in 68 i was a ten year old kid i grew up on the blues though my dad then these guys from the midlands came along a fusion of country rock heavy rock and blues i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years i was lucky enough to be there in 79 that was the best concert i've seen to date i hope a full version of that hot august night will be soon this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the nitty gritty br br long live the
<START> i agree with this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in 1993 tom selleck does a fantastic job here as always and the movie is greatly humorous and educational i'm a big fan of tom and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part bringing the film to life in a way i can't imagine any other actor being able to pull off br br this film featured some first rate japanese actors and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie japan's an awesome place to go whether you want to party sight see or just try to take everything in
<START> the first of five st films although the last is usually discounted was based around artist ronald schoolgirl characters and features the wonderful alastair sim in drag as headmistress as well as her own brother much of the humour is dated yet curiously touching and outrageous in today's pc world the girls drink gamble smoke and are later sold off to rich arabs yet always remain in charge defeating bureaucrats police judges and other establishment figures as they across england perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on tv st trinians still inspires fancy dress parties and club nights the films have recurring characters that include pc ruby gates joyce and flash harry george cole the precursor to the entire series is a charming film called 'the happiest days of your life' 1950
<START> a terrible deception controversial film winner of the teddy in berlin 2003 mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco the actors are all reciting well they are not exactly actors the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone it has no purpose nothing to do with the homo sexuality presented in other films e g before night falls 2000 by julian technically the only thing that works is the photography otherwise the camera is put in strange angles to make it more art film' and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere the film is so pretentious that bothers i mean it's good to be pretentious when you have talent to support it or maybe it is that it's so art cinema that it's incomprehensible the story flows slowly slowly slowly to me more form than essence superb edition it was good superb direction don't think so the film is weak it was an interesting project it's a shame it's a flaw one star out of four
<START> the banter and humorous rescue scene help to make this one of my favorites of the 14 movie series wonderful acting great cast and this movie contains one of the few oft noted facts about sean bean's career the part where he and alice krige fall off the horse into the water was not scripted but was left in since they both went right on acting after it happened br br this is a good follow up to the intense ending of sharpe's enemy
