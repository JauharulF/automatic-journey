<START> it is difficult to compete against classic greatness but once you make that choice and the decision is in play you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer and on the cutting edge of quality if your intention is to aim for second or third or fourth best why even try it is with that i wonder why this version of the ten commandments was written produced and aired i would ask the producers what were you thinking were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit if perhaps the producers were thinking we want to examine this biblical story from another point of view then i would say ok i watched the show now what's the point of view the premise of this possible point of view theory eludes me i can generally watch programs and right or wrong at least get a sense of what the creators were trying to accomplish not so here i recognize names such as robert the producer and i can associate his work with some eye catching product tin man flash gordon jason and the argonauts low budget entertainment based on myth history and comic book entertainment a perfect genre for sci fi channel so i still have to ask robert what was the point of this ten commandments what were you thinking
<START> i saw this movie at a screener and its the best movie i have seen in a loooong time i loved it james franco is sooo hot and him and sienna miller make the perfect couple i don't want to give away what happens but they play a pair of newlyweds who go off on their honeymoon to niagara falls and some pretty wild stuff happens along the way the movie is really really funny and sad and original i can't even say what it reminded me of but go see it i cried so hard but really loved it and wanna see it again as soon as it comes out my friends cried too i hope it comes out soon does anyone know when i would really go see it if i were you
<START> i went to see this film last night at the national film theatre in london as a birthday treat it was the the first time i've seen it and i think it has now overtaken the dreadful twister as the worst film i have ever seen disjointed for no reason self indulgent and full of imagery that from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible not particularly beautifully or shot i really don't understand why this is considered classic gay or otherwise i normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography but this was truly truly awful
<START> the year still has three weeks to go but unless a really horrendous turkey shows up before then passion of the mind may be the winner of my lousiest movie of the year contest an interesting idea badly executed and for that matter badly acted demi moore is very good at curling her lip and smoking cigarettes but is that all she does and why so many cigarettes did and myers or one of the other bad boys of nicotine have some of their illicit profits invested in this production it's confusing silly and moves at the frantic past of a arthritic earthworm i gave it a 3 should have been a 2 br br
<START> good things out of the way first br br voice acting was fine but jason lee being awesome himself that really is no surprise br br peter also did fine for what trash was given to him he acted the part shockingly well and so did patrick warburton the moronic assistant now it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well i actually liked the character better than the protagonists the lines given to him were childish but witty br br however alex did awful and hope he never acts again his scream was so disgustingly fake silence silence in the scene where he hears the dog talk an oh no impossible would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake scream br br and then there was the girl and her female dog that chased patrick's character cad on the roof at first this makes sense she's a reporter a school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless but why why the hell did she carry her dog around that was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless oh underdog her presence was extremely unnecessary br br overall the script was pathetic the only reason i give this movie a 3 is his assistance and voice
<START> awful film terrible acting cheesy totally unrealistic embarrassing to anyone who has played the game for a start that guy is not a hooker he would be snapped in two as for score that's my well no it's not for the the uneducated american audience it might come across as a good film for me well that's a few hours of my life i'll never get back i read through the reviews and came across one where the guy sounded like he knew what he was talking about then i read br br while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head br br all i can say is br br keep playing your american football and baseball leave the real sports to the big boys
<START> bette midler is the best thing about this movie it is a poor second to the original from 1962 with natalie wood as gypsy the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to cynthia only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie br br there was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star not just a poor substitute to her sister and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off
<START> i watched the first episode of the war at home because i thought it was worth replacing arrested development boy was i disappointed it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped off of grounded for life titus and married with children since they are all similar in plot and overall mood the so called punch lines are all repetitious and formulaic even more those punch lines aren't even funny at all to me they're more along the lines as being crass and crude the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug who thinks he's being funny and cool which he's not even hillary dave's daughter said so in the episode strip br br in the episode dream crusher hillary wanted to be a singer but was actually pretty bad dave and vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked after that she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to harvard after telling dave and vicky so and left the room the two of them began mindlessly mocking her also in the first episode dave said of black boyfriend does she actually think we're gonna let her go out with this guy i'd rather drink my own urine that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television and dave is constantly making fun of larry his son when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek also let's not forget that he also made fun of larry's fat girlfriend dave is the father he's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what the war at home is without a doubt the worst tv show for family that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda it's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something but the lines are all somewhat forced idiotic and pathetically juvenile br br another reason why the show's horrible is the acting mike rappaport and kyle sullivan are terrible terrible actors rappaport has to always move his hands around when he's in front of the camera he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with boston public sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts he also did this in malcolm in the middle br br so to wrap this whole thing up you all got your reasons of what's wrong with this show 1 it's unoriginal 2 the acting sucks 3 it's not even funny 4 all the jokes are the same 5 has lousy script 6 the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7 the dad's a rip off of archie bunker br br fox needs to take this trash off the air because anything's better than this
<START> like anyone else who bought this i was duped by the 20 pieces of extreme gore and banned in 20 countries or whatever it says in the box i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it tom savini rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business the revolutionized make up effects in the 80's today you don't need them as everything is done on computer but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up but i digress br br watching fantastically gory films like fulci's gates to hell or even savini's crowning achievement friday the 13th the final chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film you can't tell the difference between reality and magic br br i can't imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money as many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath you don't see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like afterwords br br the gore well it's here but not as much as one would hope or expect a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts but other then those two scenes and one involving a there is nothing really much else to this film the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but i was expecting a bit more call me sick or twisted but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places br br cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film it is much better than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for 20 00 you will feel cheated br br 3 10
<START> bean kevin perry uk tv creations that have made successful transitions onto the big screen now its ali g's turn and i m afraid to say this is not one of them br br ali has always been obscene but funny with it this film was sick and not funny at all scenes involving bestiality gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake br br ali g in da house is rubbish and deserves making very little money br br 1 out 10
<START> first of all i'd like to say i'm just an amateur in commenting movies and that english is not my native language but that i felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie possibly as a way to thank and congratulate c jay cox the cast and the crew for such a brilliant production br br yesterday i watched latter days for the first time br br at first i thought it might be similar to the movie priest which i liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet but priest maybe due to its restrict catholic ideological notions didn't supply my needs by revealing a profound sad end br br latter days on the other hand broke that concept and some other ones as well such as the mormon's principles presenting a tender and cheerful story leading it to a happy and emotive end and yet arousing a feeling of god's blessing and hope a great movie indeed br br somehow latter days made me feel l a as a city of angels br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes astoundingly beautiful gay love stories
<START> this movie purports to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is going down in the america of the late 1960's their trip to a rock festival is as far as their old bus gets without exception the characters are superficial stereotypes br br if you want to know which well established hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days just look at the credits sal i had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids thank god his career rebounded before his untimely death br br the writers on this television turkey were clueless outside of doing weed their insights into the hippie movement were laughable
<START> i'll give it this i didn't stop watching and it's not corporate which is kind of cool but my internal critic cut it to pieces i suppose i see too many movies wooden script the slang just sort of out of their mouths without any kind of flow editing mentioned before is hit and miss sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel but mostly its irritating jerky quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups the actors were marginal though had her moments br br i'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis he's a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing the directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him even i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already i didn't care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around the completely predictable ending isn't credible at all i'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams oh you just got out of jail and are on probation here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine go run it around the corner for me now don't steal from me etc br br a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope but it was let down in the end handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow raising if only mildly interesting there are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film school offering 4 10 an f
<START> awful confusing bit of crap from south of the border i've now watched it twice and i still don't really know what was going on it had something to do with a stupid looking aztec mummy a that's the dumbest looking robot i've ever seen bar none and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient aztec chick most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist this guy is a marvelous sleep aid his nemesis is a fat slob called the bat which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist br br i guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy and what a shocker the scientist's wife just happens to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend they keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason i guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it it takes him five years to do this because he's inventing a to steal the mummy or attack it or whatever he's after some treasure that the mummy has so that he can be rich but excuse me if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way br br oh well i suppose that would make too much sense instead there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy to tell you the truth i watched this because i thought a film with a name like the robot vs the aztec mummy just had to be fabulously cheesy instead it was just dully awful and mind blowingly confusing
<START> it was so boring no plot whatsoever basically a watered down version of the lion king mixed in with animal farm again no plot at all horrible worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief i maybe chuckled twice all of the semi funny parts are in the previews i hate movies like that yeah the movie pretty much sucked i don't know how it got such good ratings and reviews there is no plot or storyline if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupied through out awful i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 7 50 to see this crap
