<START> 2006 written and directed by is an extraordinary film from south india plays 15 year old who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father if she is going to succeed in life she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty br br i went to the film expecting the depiction of an wretched girl who is crushed by society this isn't what shows us the young woman is attractive intelligent and ambitious she won't accept her fate with tears or simple resignation she wants to succeed and it's never clear that she won't succeed despite the odds br br the acting that mr draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous is outstanding in the title role and urmila does an exceptional job as mrs rama devi the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancer br br in the film learns south indian classical dance as she did in real life i couldn't tell how good dancing was by indian standards but the many dance scenes were spellbinding don't think bollywood this is classical dance it's also very different from ballet because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor in sound indian dance the heel is the primary contact point br br this is a movie that is not to be missed it will work on dvd but will be better on a theater screen because the dancing will be shown to better advantage however if dvd is your only option then see it that way just be sure to see it
<START> this is indeed a spectacularly bad film but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly jaw droppingly entertaining i want to add to the other comments on this film br br the rock band on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad wigs br br watch for the severe continuity problem with the kid's stuffed tiger it turns into a lion a leopard and back again it's filthy or clean depending on the shot br br spoiler the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid and the writers br br the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin clutching his stuffed tiger and away will stick permanently in your memory br br listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy the guide demands his monk's robes as payment the priest drops on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell not the deep of a church bell but the ding of a bell from a boxing match br br this is an absolute hoot to watch
<START> what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed br br everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony br br live and let live br br if anyone knows the quote please let me know thank you br br this film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later
<START> so many bad reviewers it made me wonder what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director did you all expected a super hit flawless movie no way you already can see raj kumar loves multi starrer movies all of his earlier works where multi but no one was flawless take the first jaani dushman for instance so many flaws but still good fun anyways sticking to the movie the movie jaani dushman is a hindi fantasy film about a snake who can take any form which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover on the people who caused it its quite good with a great star cast but i think it could have been much much better for instance take the script can't say its flawless for example take the ages br br do 40 48 yrs old still study in university br br there are many many more i won't list more but there are dozen more a solid 5 5 is good for this one br br 75
<START> if i'm to like a movie i need to care about the lead characters and what happens to them in this waste pod of a film i found myself hoping that they would all die in the end none of the characters are people that you'd ever want to meet they all made me sick if not for a few nude scenes i would have given this wretched movie a 1
<START> famous and mysterious recluse who's some kind of lethal telekinetic psychic vampire abruptly dies under bizarre circumstances nice girl high school student julie wells a warm and sympathetic performance by the lovely meg tilly wants desperately to be accepted by the snobby clique the sisters played to sublimely bitchy perfection by leslie robin evans and the ever cuddly elizabeth daily so she agrees to spend a night in a creepy mausoleum where body has been interred as part of an initiation rite naturally still has his extraordinary powers so it's going to be a very long and harrowing night of pure nerve wracking terror for poor julie br br director co screenwriter tom who later gave us the enjoyably tongue in cheek friday the 13th part vi jason lives eschews graphic gore in favor of creating a brooding and eerie atmosphere but fails to pull this particular feat off because the first hour is way too slow talky and uneventful to be remotely scary or suspenseful however i nonetheless still found this flawed fright flick to be oddly appealing and entertaining the big hairdos a goofy music montage sequence badly timed false scares including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag a scene at a glittery video game arcade kids gleefully smoking pot and the hilariously dumb teen slang brain give this picture a certain endearingly quaint 80's period charm hal handsome polished cinematography i especially dug the smoothly gliding steadicam tracking shots bob spooky yet funky synthesizer score and tom splendidly ghoulish make up f x are all up to snuff the ever stolid adam west of tv's batman fame merely takes up space in a nothing secondary part the mausoleum makes for an impressively vast and unsettling main location the grand finale with a bunch of ghastly rotting corpses popping out of their coffins and floating about qualifies as a marvelously macabre shock set piece sure this baby definitely ain't some unjustly unsung gem but it still delivers plenty of pleasingly silly and diverting cheesy fun all the same
<START> this film starts as it ends and ends as it starts what is in the middle is a collection of comedy philosophy music observations commentaries mini stories colour and lots more it looks at the world and our lives and tells the monkees story from the view of the group members themselves it also looks at television and film and makes a visual commentary it shocks also with scenes of war and shows how we are just pawns in a big game it says all this and much more but if you don't look at it objectively you won't see much more than scenes strung together to join up the music it's the sort of film that can never get boring because it's so cleverly done
<START> in love and war is a simple feel good tv film and should be viewed as such br br possible spoiler br br it is the story of a wwii british soldier captured with his commando by the italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage as the italians surrender to the allies the commando is freed and attempts to flee however the germans arrive and the commando is captured again only injured remains at large the rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the partisans and his survival br br end of spoiler br br based on a true story in love and war is a refreshingly straightforward film half comedy half romance the story is simple and unambiguous the is warm and sunny and the various stereotypes the desperately unorganized or romantic italians the serious stern looking germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic british although unoriginal are still humorous nicola piovani's musical score also adds to the mediterranean flavour br br although it is far from being a tea with mussolini or a la vita e bella in love and war is a sweet simple film that will put a smile and maybe even a little tan on your face
<START> if you are a weirdo who thinks it's romantic and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother get her pregnant and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you then you would like this movie br br nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what he's doing he can't do right by his job his family or maria he's a loser there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie it is vile and incestuous br br it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie i couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance' i'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one 0 10
<START> i saw it last night and i was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie the whole audience was bruce campbell has made a damn funny movie i don't want to give anything away but when the film turns and gets wacky it gets really wacky just one funny scene after another my hats of to mr campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget bruce was there to introduce the film and do a q and a which was a treat a lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame but bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic he was great anyway loved the film i'll be looking forward to seeing this on dvd later this year b sure to check it out on the sci fi channel this fall i highly recommend this one
<START> bruce willis as usual does an excellent job br br warning may be considered a spoiler br br while my friend thought it was good i kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end after seeing such great flicks as the patriot and chicken run i was really disappointed in disney's the kid br br willis plays a middle aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images he's an image consultant an unknown kid shows up yes it's him but younger and even lily tomlin can see him at this point i'm reminded of a cross between a poor quantum leap episode and a bad time traveling flick br br kid and willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period they figure it out they meet willis when he's older nevermind that it never goes into detail how old willis them between time periods and gets them together to begin with how he got that knowledge to begin with how he came to the realization that he needed to do this and so on br br basically it's a very tired unoriginal uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it the good news is that the kid actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television
<START> when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought god this is horrible but i loved wet hot american summer so i knew something didn't make sense there was nothing left for me to do but search out for the stella shorts which i had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there when i found them not only were my dildo expectations met but i found probably the greatest comedy scenes i've seen in years the set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs not only did i laugh my ass off the first time i watched them but continued to laugh harder when i watched them over and over again it's really a shame comedy central had the restrictions of cable television for the stella series it would have faired much better on hbo or showtime their brand of humor can't be restricted by censors or popular culture given even if it was on hbo i'm sure the masses would have voted it canceled in a season or less but still it would have been fantastic needless to say i'm now in love with stella and all it's individual members any stella fan should check out david wain's site with all his short films they are equally as enjoyable as stella itself so my hat goes off to michael michael ian black and david wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with stella i hope to see much more of the troupe in the future
<START> weird this is a tv movie yet the rating on the box says it's rated r there's nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an r rating aside from that though the movie is very slow and pointless i mean the idea was good but nothing was done with the storyline it just wasn't developed it's mildly creepy and the acting is actually quite good better than the movie deserves i don't see myself watching it again anytime soon if ever there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one i haven't seen too many wes craven films so i can't really compare it to any of his others as for this movie itself though i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed for me i can't give chiller a higher rating than 3 10
<START> oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i can't imagine that rommel wouldn't have known something about hitler's government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i can't do it i also can't buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential
