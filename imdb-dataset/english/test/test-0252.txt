<START> the efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by alan rickman and emma thompson 2 extremely gifted actors makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment and i might add that hal holbrook shines as the senator this movie deserves five stars i give it a ten on your scale and the ending is perfect i am constantly amazed at the ability of british actors to master our american accents i was convinced that all the actors were born in louisiana and what finer locale for a mystery than new orleans the big easy also known as the crescent city permeates every scene as writer and director sebastian deserves high praise
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i've ever saw a 14 year old boy jason shepherd wrote an english paper called big fat liar when his skateboard was taken he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo when he went into the limo he met a famous producer from hollywood marty wolf when he left the limo he forgot one thing his paper so marty wolf took it and he turned jason's english paper into a movie when jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and marty took it his parents and his english teacher didn't believe him so jason and his friend had to fly to los angeles to go to hollywood to make marty admit he stole his story to jason's parents when jason told marty to call his dad that marty stole that paper marty tricked him and burned his paper jason got so angry that marty burned that paper so marty called security to get jason out of his site jason and realized marty isn't going to admit the truth in order to take marty down in phase 2 the jason and put permanent blue dye into the pool and when marty jumps in his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off then they put permanent orange dye in marty's shampoo and when he uses it his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too finally they put lots of glue on marty's earpiece to make him call jason's father and when marty uses it it sticks to his ear it was funny when marty's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear after that they tricked marty by telling monty who is marty's assistant that duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on when marty went in to see duncan he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up when marty was in the house jason and switched the controls of his car when marty drove his car he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push he's stupid enough to fall for it when marty hit the rear end of the the wrecked his car it was so funny so marty starts to call jason's dad and tricked him again he was on the phone but it wasn't his father he called security after the security got jason and out of marty's site they suggested them to go home monty was going to be on jason and side cause she knew that marty was a liar and a jerk so she told rocco who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to l a when monty came to the kids she's going to help the kids move into phase 4 the payback jason splits the crew into 3 teams for phase 4 one team will distract and trick marty until jason's parents get to the set marty first rode with frank jackson but his car broke down so he rode with but he took him into the desert and leave him there when marty was in the desert a helicopter came to rescue him after that one of the blades are jammed so marty and the pilot got off the helicopter after that he was on the way to the set and when jason saw him marty stopped and saw what jason has his monkey so marty went after jason and and when they saw lester he released the water and when the water came it pushed marty away marty was still after the kids and when went the other way jason led marty to the top of the apartment building at the top jason was challenging marty by making him admit the truth and marty will never ever tell the truth when the crew caught marty in surprise all the people including jason's parents who were at the set knew what marty did marty was going to kill jason but the only way for jason to escape is jump down from the top after that his parents believed him that marty took his story when the people who were on the set left this is the end of marty at the end jason's story big fat liar was a movie i cant get enough of it
<START> it's one of the paradoxes of basil rathbone's wartime anti nazi sherlock holmes films voice of terror sh in washington and this one that while the plots and settings are mostly terrible he is so good in them despite a bizarre wind swept hairstyle meant to make him look younger he blazes through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly register how flimsy the plots are here he also has great acting rapport with lionel atwill who makes a wonderfully repulsive professor moriarty a heavy cockroach with nice hints of sadism and depravity it may not have been acting kids at the climax changed into a lab coat in order to drain rathbone's blood drop by drop he's as over the top sinister as seinfeld's arch nemesis newman the movie itself is ancient kiddie matinÃ©e fare but it benefits from director roy william neill's attention to staging and atmosphere it also looks fairly sharp in the dvd's ucla restoration don't even think of buying any other edition all of them faded choppy public domain prints
<START> this movie was terrible my friend and i were so bored by it we fast forwarded through the last half of the movie just to see what happened it's the typical sports thing she either wins or she loses the only remotely interesting thing was when the one guy refers to someone as a veg e tab le that will be a line my friend and i bring up for years to come reminding us of this colossal cheesy cliche waste of time
<START> what would it be like to be accused of being a subversive this is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters one being the accused subversive the other being the interrogator it is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end this film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political governments thoroughly you will never get the point of this film as proved by 90 of the reviews here
<START> little vera is the story of a russian teenager her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life sliding increasingly into decay in her search for meaning she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious sergei whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly spirals out of control br br little vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way the drinking of the father the enabling and lack of understanding of the mother the casual lies and misdirection of the brother and vera herself forgiving them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch however the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay little vera presented a vastly different view of soviet life than had ever been seen before in fact little vera is a portrait of the collapse of soviet society painted in shades of pain desperation and rust it is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order br br although painful and desperately unsatisfying the film itself is definitely worth seeing if only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping russia today
<START> i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the mini series i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement if you analyze all of the aspects of a video film production there are areas where the film is arguably vastly superior br br certainly many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini series specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and family that said i found catherine zeta jones' character much more compelling as the desperate women from poverty to riches who won't go back that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil and yes i understand her children she was desperate i just didn't see her as being as desperate br br further while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini series benicio del toro's character was very compelling an anchor for the film that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways a fantastic adaptation of course i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue br br after watching the first episode of the mini series i actually rewatched the film why i kept reading about the fantastic acting i found the performances in the first episode of the mini series to be borderline laughable certainly this improved as the mini series progressed now having just finished both versions in a few days i can't agree that the performances in the mini series reached the same level as say benicio del toro who was brilliant in the film though paterson shah and lindsay duncan were very good i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini series i was not impressed with the germans throughout br br finally the dialogue as delivered in the film is much more nuanced especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim careful you're beginning to sound like your husband as opposed to hahahaha you sound like karl again i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing this was a prime example br br other superior aspects of the film in my opinion score cinematography editing br br should i complain that the film wasn't longer no i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format the changes made stood on their own i mean would you sit in a theater for 5 7 10 hours of course not br br mini series 8 out of 10 br br film 9 out of 10
<START> so the wwe has done it they have poured over into film their first one being see no evil starring their very own kane i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film it just seemed to clichÃ© and looked like nothing new to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad a viewer stated above that it is good b horror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the character he sold the role really well and really did look menacing but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around in solid muscle the acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done considering this was directed by a porn movie director i was quite surprised i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film and save room for the ending too cuz it's a good one and stick around after the credits too
<START> i first saw the buddy holly story when i was about seven years old i had no idea who buddy holly was nor can i remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television tuned in to hbo and watch this engaging biopic what i remember was realizing that it was a somewhat true story about someone who actually lived i recall the music great songs that i still love today i can't believe gary busey sang his own songs and so well what a stud then came the end he died he freaking died i couldn't believe it i had no warning no prior knowledge like most coming into this film it taught me a harsh lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most movies teach us i just watched the film again tonight and was engaged all over again and a little saddened br br 8 out of 10 but i'll admit to a little bias
<START> the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky dashing irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism it was robin hood all over again and flynn blossomed in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing and this one was no exception br br it also benefits from the return of former co star olivia de havilland despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership the part of strong minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynn's later films and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a romping adventure movie and the screen chemistry is for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effect br br the flynn de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability when most of flynn's other westerns held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly cursory despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out schoolboy fashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but it's a trifle too morally convenient br br however these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players memorably including anthony quinn in an all but wordless role as the sioux leader errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal charmingly sheepish looks unexpected sweetness mischievous flash point indignation cheerful fellowship and sheer high octane charisma he's a reckless braggart but you can't help but like him and it's hard to go away without the tune of threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter br br this is one of flynn's lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered
<START> this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets it is also very shocking the physical and psychological torture both explicit and implied is mixed with calm and even humourous stretches so the horror is always unexpected and brutal i'm not soft but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen the message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer this is the film i will always remember both actors for
<START> sure it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode but it is certainly fun to watch you might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down or chuckling and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works the panel of hosts have more of a good natured friendly dare i say canadian style of commentary compared with cutthroat us reality programming i think the people who complain about this show don't get the joke they are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself keys to the vip is a great caricature of reality shows sports tv culture and the club scene i hope they do another season and i'd be interested to see if a us version appears it's certainly a fun original premise
<START> a cbs radio program entitled we the people assists in finding an american home for vienna refugee charles coburn as karl braun a skilled surgeon and pool hustler he arrives with beautiful daughter sigrid as leni who is studying to become a nurse relocated to a small dusty midwestern village they are welcomed at the station by burly john wayne as john phillips and his uncle spencer charters as a veterinarian ms is unhappy in the and wants to leave immediately but the prospect of romance with mr wayne might change her mind br br god answers the citizens' many prayers for rain but it may not be enough to save the farming town the entire town is advised to relocate to oregon wayne wants to stay and tough it out coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic and learns her fiancÃ© presumed dead will be arriving to claim her as his wife she feels duty bound to accept but he has a dark secret this film does not flatter wayne who seems way out of his element being paired with promoted as another garbo doesn't help they do have a cute scene in wayne's car jalopy an italian car br br three faces west 7 3 40 bernard john wayne sigrid charles coburn spencer charters
<START> i worked on this atrocity ten years ago luckily for me no one knows it because i didn't make the final cut and when i saw the movie in the theaters i was glad my agents were driven nuts by the apparently first time filmmakers rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often they later told me that once back in california we shot in atlanta these professionals had 4 1 2 hours worth of footage even edited down to 90 minutes it's at least twice as long as it needs to be i found hulk hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise what a waste of film
<START> no emotion bad music and i am a reformed eighties metal guy so i would be vulnerable to some good stuff everything is half done the brother is a parody there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next the tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time wahlberg is okay and aniston is slumming we know she didn't need the money is this the only role she could fit into her summer break surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on vh1 which is only slightly less often than ozzy does it barely qualifies as a tv movie it's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically
