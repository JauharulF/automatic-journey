<START> i can't believe i bought this movie on dvd i don't even remember it being shown on tv last year why in the world couldn't they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made damn and randy quaid looks like he's been on the same drugs as jerry lewis i didn't know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated boy did i make a mistake if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation well at least i didn't pay more then 10 bucks for it maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records then again maybe not ps i still haven't watched it yet my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie the chronicles of riddick unrated director's cut woo freaking hoo
<START> first of all despite the low rating on this site i saw something quite worthy in this film and will gladly defend it and no i'm not connected to the crew in any way br br i came across the dvd of the wind by accident and had this strong feeling that it wasn't going to be quite like the video packaging described so i took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by this strange very different drama i'm assuming the dvd marketing and summary were the work of home video to hook a rental or sale the tag line love comes in many forms was changed to terror comes in many forms sure smaller films' rentals and sales depend strongly on grabbing a person's attention especially if they've never heard of the film before a similar case happened with the film the item that's probably what is working against this release as horror fans read the description of an ancient wind carrying with it omens of the apocalypse it's easy to think that that is what this film is all about and will turn some college students in the story into crazy savages that go on a killing spree thus at the time this review was submitted is most likely the reason for the lower rating on imdb i can understand people becoming upset and thinking they were fooled by that summary seeing the apocalyptic intro but then experiencing a dark drama i can forgive the marketing choice since i enjoyed the wind and thought it was a refreshing change of pace from major hollywood offerings it's just that if the intended audience was given the attention more might voice a higher rating br br the wind in this film is basically just a metaphor for society and is the story of four friends who make some bad choices and how their lives quickly turn into ones of desperate self preservation after going too far in a to one of their own a death occurs and each person tries to save his her own standing manipulation between them becomes the norm and by the end we see how self preservation becomes their main motivation over good judgment civilized to savage basically this is very apparent throughout by noticing that the use of a knife branches as clubs fists and kicking are instruments of violence instead of guns these characters are in a way doing all the wrong things for the right reason just to stay on top of the situation since they've already taken things too far while there are many implied violent images it's interesting to see that there is an absence of cussing and nudity br br what works in favor of the wind are the unknown actors bigger stars were originally intended but i find it works better when you have lesser known capable actors this way you can get into the story without sometimes thinking oh that's tom cruise for instance instead of an actual tormented person dealing with an extraordinary situation even unusual conversations like between mic and billy in a field and mic confronting claire in her bedroom hold up well and feel quite natural in the strange universe of fairview which has cozy homes a forest and wide open fields i kept thinking of the calm landscapes concealing darker secrets in the reflecting skin which director michael mentions as an inspiration in his commentary br br the wind manages to get messages across without being heavy handed about it br br sure if you look carefully you'll see many symbols and dialogue that other directors would just pound you over the head with i even understood the infamous kissing scene between claire john and billy within the context of the story without being surprised it happened i am still amazed at how some people guys mainly who complain about two men kissing in a scene would obviously have no problem if the scene were of two gals kissing instead all is handled nicely here and additional viewings will make things more clear without making you groan and say oh man how did i miss that things sink in gradually and i appreciated that or you could listen to the dvd commentary as well for more things revealed br br for those of us that got the intentions of this film the wind is a breath of fresh air no pun intended in a time when most films are made in order to just make money and be heard knocking other films out of their box office competition standing when mentioned on entertainment tonight or cnn br br years later it's always the great little discoveries like the wind that stay in my mind not processed star driven blockbusters br br get past the marketing ploy from home video and you just might find this an engaging story indeed i strongly recommend it to friends that seek out unusual films like this one
<START> this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed
<START> in the of 1942 two soviet soldiers are captured by nazi friendly in captivity the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly one of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality incomprehensible to the other man last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history the cinematography by vladimir is incredible particularly in the opening sequence where long slow tracking shots depicting the solitude and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural set the mood perfectly it is easy to draw comparison to tarkovsky's films even more so since tarkovsky's alter ego has a small but important part in the ascent the acting is overall brilliant especially by boris in the part of the film reveals an old fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion which feels related to characters such as dostoyevsky's prince or tarkovsky's stalker however this is not a weakness of the film but rather one of its greatest strengths the religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to be moved the emotional richness of the film cannot be overstated the answer is not as simplified as a short summary of the plot would make you think the slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other are somewhat reminiscent of the commissar another great soviet film the ascent deserves a second watching as well as a third and a tenth it continues to provide interesting ideas beautiful images and emotional complexity
<START> this is a great movie to look at since it so nicely directed by but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it in terms of its story it's an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the character's motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to what br br somehow it doesn't make the movie any less great to watch though it's made with passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and camera work br br also the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information guess if you're completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of and robespierre in particular this movie will be a perfect one for you to watch br br it's somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle without ever stepping too much in detail often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still one fine example of french cinema despite the fact that it's being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as well br br gÃ©rard depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one so this doesn't really ever become a big complaint other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain points br br a great movie that could had been brilliant br br 8 10
<START> the falcon the snowman offers some of the best acting from its two leads hutton in a brilliantly understated role calmly portrays the confusion and angst of a man who seemingly turns traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father penn as the co conspirator basically just along for the ride and drug money explosively turns in one of the strongest performances of his multi talented career
<START> the silver screen gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's rainbows there's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen but the film's namesake is more like 85 going on 25 with his energy humor and lust for life the story of entertainer extraordinaire uncle frank his devoted wife aunt and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to live each day as if it's your last and brings a glimmer of hope to those often dreaded golden years a great movie for young and old audiences
<START> if you've not seen this then look out for it it is available on dvd it is a channel 4 uk production possibly in conjunction with german and danish tv if you've seen the film it is basically the same plot several stories are connected through the drugs trade the story jumps between the housewife played by the excellent lyndsay duncan trying to complete a deal on behalf of her husband who to her surprise is an international drugs dealer and generally dangerous man br br a minister who is embedded in his job to the detriment of his family is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drugs trafficking he gets a few eye openers to the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to have a he then visit pakistan officially where he seems to be taught that the abuse not simply the drug or its casual use is the problem and also gets to sample some produce an excellent scene where he simultaneously realises what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem in pakistan we get to see the other side the desperation of farmers who can barely survive turning to opium production and crime lords the pointless attempts at subsidy resulting in the system getting rich and a country so drenched in drugs yet only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west around all this a customs official interpol agent tries to catch the connection in heroin smuggling seeking justice for his murdered partner this really is a masterpiece super understated performances from all the main actors in a way only european cinema can really do br br a must see especially if you have seen the film they compliment each other present some subtly different opinions attitudes from both sides of the pond
<START> i couldn't wait for the end this is absolutely the worst film i have ever seen if you thought that just about anyone could make a watchable movie these folks prove that there is a minimum skill set required this is a film with no redeeming features whatsoever it scores a zero in every department this is more than just 'amateur' as the audience is given no consideration or regard at all there is no serious attempt to act or entertain the storyline is aimless pointless and senseless the cast look very uncomfortable and completely lack direction the technical aspects of the film are poor br br as a dvd it makes a good drinks coaster
<START> anatomie anatomy is an entertaining and engaging film that falls short of delivering the discomfort that should be connected with the films subject matter the idea of ethical ignorance in the medical science world is one that pushes the viewer towards discomfort and the realism of the institutions and the special effects make it a not entirely easy film to watch br br however the characters the script and the gloss of the film all seem too familiar with the scream movies that this sort of genre sadly then whilst the subject is one to care about the viewer is presented with another movie full of college student characters that we don't really get a chance to care about unresolved subplots and hammy stage killings that have been reinventing themselves since the memorable drew barrymore opening scene in scream several years back br br steven makes a fair effort of the script and the direction but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme whilst we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances we are unfortunately left with the old feeling nothing is wrong with this film but nothing is extraordinary either br br an entertaining film and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by the post scream 'horror' culture 6 out of 10
<START> if you're into alternate realities contemplating what's real and what's just a fantasy this is an edge of your seat thriller that'll keep you guessing and really make you think try to get a copy of it and see for yourself i watched it at an l a film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw it helped that it was actually about something unlike the others that were screened it's very well directed and the production value is top notch i would compare it to jacob's ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we're in you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it's screening at any festivals near you try to check it out
<START> yeah a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction now it's a prison again kind of well it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange so i guess in that way it's like a prison not really though when sasha steven seagal's character is being admitted into prison he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend like he's in line for the security check at the airport then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches smacking around a couple of security guards br br let me tell you something you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison they'll shoot you on the spot ja rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch oh and there are guys wearing beanies and and whatnot in prison federal prison br br you can't dress like that at most high schools in america br br speaking of ja rule i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth including ja rule himself had to have been 50 cent just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 cent who had lived the thug life for real and ja rule who had not every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 cent laughing his ass off ja rule looks like a rowdy 9 year old every time he appears on screen br br anyway getting back to the plot it's funny sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization he's sentenced to five years and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which aren't even well choreographed br br oh how about this a helicopter crashes through the roof of new alcatraz at one point accidentally freeing all of the inmates and what do they do they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doesn't matter the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing br br so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in state of the art execution chamber evidently not for stealing 200 million dollars in gold but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught br br hey good thinking people if you can't get information out of someone kill them that's a great way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the 200 million for themselves br br oh and the 200 million is in gold bricks i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into currency br br there's also the issue of the warden at the prison he's some tough talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore from the barrio which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense these people go to mexico the comedian says and they're like oh my god people live there that's like a total shack br br the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison i don't care if she is a united states supreme court justice br br this woman could him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge ha br br and by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53 that's a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funny br br the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman that was the funniest thing i've seen in a movie in a long long time br br you know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched it and i still don't have a single positive thing to say about it except of course for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian woman br br so read my review of and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written br br i imagine the at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'half past dead' pg 13 after giving the anti gun movie for an r br br way to go guys
<START> some ugly weirdo who had three families cheated on and neglected all of them built ugly useless buildings all over which are now unappreciated and crumbling his bastard half jew son runs around interviewing random jewish senile people who we care nothing about and shows his dreadful narrating and writing skills while tragic piano music plays this goes on for almost two boring hours and amounts to nothing br br all you shallow hippie people who watch these stupid documentaries eating and yogurt think all this crap is so important it's not save the whales no one cares
<START> i loved this movie it is a very simple plot and from what i understand it is based on a true story growing up in the 80's with hard rock hair metal may have something to do with my love of this film but even aside from the music it is a really fun movie to watch give it a try you will like it unless you are the hardest of critics and only like movies of citizen kane caliber
<START> this is a true feel good movie full of genuine sweetness and admirable people although the premise requires a significant suspension of disbelief it is worth the trouble to do so the director writers and actors truly convey what it feels like to be in love
