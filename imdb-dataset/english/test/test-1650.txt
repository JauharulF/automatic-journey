<START> this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen it has no good features at all br br it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics br br the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman eh you what br br other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting br br i left the cinema feeling cheated br br needless to say i could not this film to anyone
<START> what a tedious turgid boring mess this is a classic example of all that is wrong with contemporary english theater film about as exciting as a closet full of dirty socks the very opposite of living film only the presence of joanne whalley gives it any spark
<START> stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie although he was portraying a much younger person i still recall my fascination with story and while i was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made i had to see it br br not only does this boast a great performance by stewart it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data making it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself and the look of the plane itself was great br br i quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love i had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel
<START> the second film about the adventures of the pair asterix is 10 times better than the first the humor is great and irreverant and the script is well executed taken from the original 1965 comic book by i fell asleep with the first film although i am a great fan of asterix and was reluctant to see this sequel but i am glad this movie proved me wrong excellent comedy for everyone highly recommended
<START> the foreigner is a tale of foreign intrigue with seagal at the center as a deep cover operative who has a package which everyone wants and are willing to kill to get the flick is uninspired with less of the usual action stuff which put seagal on the movie map fire fights hand to hand combat pyrotechnics stunts etc and more of a story which is convoluted uninteresting and full of meaningless filler what action there is seems token and gratuitous while seagal looking more and more like a pork chop meanders through this insipid flick expressionless and bored while manifesting no improvement in acting ability somewhere around the glimmer man or fire down below seagal flicks took a nose dive and the foreigner is just an continuation of that trend nothing here worth watching except for the most die hard seagal fans c
<START> if andrei tarkovsky had been a hack he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world i am convinced a son without a name takes care of his mother without a name they love each other i guess no they don't i'm sure these aren't characters they aren't even actors playing characters at least it could be pretty but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a macintosh computer and could sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage 1 10
<START> could be considered some mild spoilers but no more than in anyone else's review of this film br br i knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original carrie which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire carrie white was victim epitomized and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel br br whoever conceived the rachel character for the rage must have completely missed the subtleties of carrie for the audience to genuinely share the victim's rage s he must be a sympathetic character a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his her own vices rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of sissy carrie and she looks and acts like she should be right along side the and popular that she ends up torching she like the rest of them has a soul that is every bit as corrupt whereas carrie was a complete innocent br br it just doesn't work there's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children not even the home improvement boy getting offed in this movie's climactic scene and it's so unnecessarily gory there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym br br and there is one person in particular that this movie should not have had the audacity to kill off but i won't say who it is if you've seen the original carrie it's the sort of character who dies unjustly br br at least they did create the connection to carrie appropriately it's explained as it should have been but that and the arm tattoo which was done rather nicely is just about the only thing this movie has going for it br br yet another hideous scream knock off and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made br br rating 1 out of 10 i wasn't expecting much but i was still horribly disappointed an unsympathetic character a series of irritating pop culture references thrown in for no good reason and an ending scene that pales in comparison to carrie 's gravestone shocker
<START> you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie br br there is no plot as such basically it's a crazy mixed up pastiche of various unrelated sequences but it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength in short it was a classic cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema it contains some good songs some ultra groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique br br i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons first it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time if a feature movie flops at the box office the consequences can be dire for all concerned secondly it was for the most part a creative success and finally as already mentioned it is unquestionably a classic of the genre and as such it is now historically important br br unfortunately head came too late in the monkees career but there again they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image br br clearly the members of the group knew only too well that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project in a way it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years in short they wanted out and they were going to say a few things before they left br br history however has vindicated the band let the critics be damned the monkees left behind some of the best most polished and successful pop records of the decade yes they had plenty of help but at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio mikes they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts they were fun and just a little bit crazy but unlike some of their contemporaries they were never threatening you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt br br head probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles hard day's night but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger who have the ability to appreciate its significance br br enjoy
<START> my wife and kids in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoyed it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where junior george o gore ii got his driver's license if you want to know why you'll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> this film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie but it revealed incompetence at almost every level br br the presence of roger moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre because moore always has lead roles and he can't act but this movie also had ian holm and lee marvin in it and was based on a wilbur smith book so i thought i'd give it a chance when i saw the dvd for sale in the bargain bin br br it was a mistake the opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a reel with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated the scene showed a at sea with a german crew this bad editing was a sign of things to come but the scene with the was interesting enough to keep me watching the special effects were good and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in german indicating that the director at least paid attention to historical detail i was surprised br br so i kept watching and then moore appeared and my were confirmed bad acting clichÃ©d lines clichÃ©d cinematography and cheap humour but worst of all there is a disastrous attempt to blend the light hearted feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy it just does not work br br the film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started Â in the middle of a reel
<START> there are bad movies movies that are horrible and then there's a tiny rarified body of movies that are so horribly bad that even after seeing them just once the sheer awfulness makes it impossible to forget them even decades later this is exactly such a movie and it's hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good let's see george kennedy the cigar chomping tough guy mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to airline captain and after the concorde comes under missile attack don't ask he resorts to stunts like shooting a flare gun out the cockpit window despite presumably flying at mach 2 all the while doing the sort of wild high g evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings off any real airliner never mind the effect of the passengers but the absolute worst part of the film at least to dedicated airplane buffs like myself is that this atrocity starred one of the coolest sexiest and most technologically remarkable planes ever to fly the concorde or just plain concorde as its pilots refer to it deserved far better this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like audrey hepburn and putting her in a porky's sequel thankfully the release of the ever hilarious airplane the following year brought the whole airport franchise to a well deserved halt as anyone even contemplating a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike br br 1 10
<START> i just want to say that this movie was excellent br br i loved it from the beginning until the end br br the acting was great the director did an amazing job and i would like to see it again br br jennifer tilly did a very good performance the guy that interpreted his father manny was another great actor but i can not recall his name br br i can't wait for el padrino ii br br damian looks so good and i think he is one of the most talented actors out there there is of latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film br br rent it rent it rent it
<START> i was lucky enough recently to see ingrid bergman's name attached to a film i had never seen or even heard of on amc what a stroke of luck br br to marvel at her flawless and seamless performance isn't the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent br br walter mathau not my favorite was nearly perfect and goldie hawn suprisingly was fabulous tender at times demanding then just plain goofy there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie br br that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of 20 year olds was amazing to watch she is effortless in her return to the screen at age 54 the supporting cast was great and the lines the lines are exquisite br br a top 5 romantic comedy of all time
<START> very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists br br the story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events br br this is one of meryl streep's best roles in years she plays a cold calculating cunning director of the cia who allows these things to go on she is out of the george bush dick cheney school of handling the war on terrorism had her part been expanded miss streep certainly would have been up for an award at oscar time br br jake gyllenhaal is our hero a cia agent who really can't take what's going on br br we have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed finely paced film br br alan arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator mr arkin seems to get better with age
<START> leos carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever seriously if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor i would have thrashed pierre to within an inch of his life no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid both at the same time except maybe heathcliff in emily bronte's wuthering heights after spending 134 minutes with pierre i need a large glass of brandy never have i been so angry at a main character ok having said that x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i've ever seen in any film which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking and i'm talking graphic here by the way x will beat the hell out of you though so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it
