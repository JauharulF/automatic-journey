<START> if you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting jokes props and overall film making as me and my friends you need to rent this br br from simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is you should assume more not funny poor quality great hilarious content through out its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen tv to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends not to mention a hilariously serious scene where t rex becomes a father figure for one of the kids yeah br br it should be in the comedy section but you'll find it with kid movies if you find it at all so call your friends over sit back relax get ready to laugh and enjoy you will be quoting the laughably horrific one liners in this movie for weeks whats with all the ruckus
<START> purportedly made back to back with nights of the living dead' with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have laura gemser much derided by all i rather like this movie sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and i actually like the hardcore i find it at once naturalistic and exotic and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises i find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around the creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is it has to be said a disappointment still in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first or afterwards in at least one case and this film is not as slow as some maintain moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation not least the lady scientist and her urge for two and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat gaze back at the island they have escaped from and find there is still time for one last act of copulation
<START> treading water is a very beautiful movie i would put it straight under the wonderful short movie bella from fiona mackenzie it's not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general i am looking forward to seeing more of laurel work in the future the actors angie redman and nina are quite good the main characters relationship could have been a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit i am surprised that angie redman doesn't appear much in other movies a great first step as a director for laurel himmel i am sure there's more to see from her skills
<START> even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the vietnam war jacob's ladder the deer hunter apocalypse now and taxi driver to an extent one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened even contemplating the horror feels inhuman and a progression or retreat to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of apocalypse now coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made loosely based on joseph conrad's 1902 classic heart of darkness which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization a surfacing of a bestial nature as it were a la lord of the flies it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to vietnam the story is of willard a general commissioned on a special mission to cambodia after his first tour of duty in vietnam is served willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in saigon psychologically unable to go back home eerily echoing nicky in the deer hunter so he is contacted his mission is to assassinate a renegade green beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the river and who has purportedly gone completely insane worshiped like a god by the natives and killing indiscriminately this man's name is colonel kurtz played by marlon brando in the second best role of his career the best being stanley kowalski in a streetcar named desire as willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying his witnessing the horrors and the insanity and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with kurtz before they even meet by the time they do methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out of place apocalypse a place beyond morality the outpost on the end of the world the loss of civilization the loss of judgement of self monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a green beret and his later revelation is one of the most chilling and well delivered speeches in cinema history the film is about trauma about the human spirit and its breaking point here it's a lot like the deer hunter and just as good apocalypse however takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level coppola's sweeping footage of the humid murky jungles of cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky set to an oddly fitting doors soundtrack as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with wagner blasting from speakers a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling darkly humorous and strikingly pointless war scenes ever this all contributes to the sense of apocalypse the end of the world and not at some distant point in the future but apocalypse now and forever the deer hunter is much more up close and personal you can even tell by the title and shows the effect trauma has on the individual psyche the breaking down of the human soul and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness or to limp on this is why both films are equal they are two parts of the same thing in heart of darkness kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality civilization and his inner savage in apocalypse now kurtz has left all conflict behind he is beyond good and evil he has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death kurtz indeed is only waiting for death quoting t s eliot in his temple to himself lost in the jungle his last words and the words echoed at the end of the movie are the horror the horror he is referring to the infinite void of existence of the human psyche and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind where atrocities are born again it is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film the experience in short that willard experiences on his journey the end part at the outpost almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in the deer hunter is one of the most deeply calmly and seductively disturbing things i've ever seen
<START> eric bogosian gives as great a performance as you'll ever see in an oliver stone film his barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone on or off the air that offends him adapted from stage play talk radio is a vicious and frightening ride that doesn't let you off until it's too late by then you've become familiar with the fringe of racists rapists wannabe assassins and mere prank callers who listen speak and lurk in the dark of dallas nights br br stone behaves himself if that's even possible letting bogosian dominate every scene from barry's humble beginnings to the make or break point when his radio show can reach national syndication the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as the lovers and or co workers that all have being used and tossed aside by barry in common br br the only thing i'd change is the recurring theme music bad to the bone i'd have used bachman turner not fragile a better song one i haven't heard in a film so far and a driving relentless tune whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to barry's life br br listen if you dare
<START> harlan knowles lance henriksen brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter erica what they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch and it's still out there waiting for them br br it was a late night when i this into my dvd player i seriously wish i could go back in time and stop me most people will tell you that films like house of the dead or s i c k serial clown killers will be the movies you wish you've never seen wrong this will be br br i've seen a lot of crap but this is the only crap that's haunted me how i wish i never watched this the acting actually isn't so bad it's just the writing and the directing and the pacing and everything i am actually a fan of sasquatch films but not this one br br please listen to my warning don't watch this
<START> i wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script who then he travels to hollywood to get even but hey it's still a fun film frankie of malcom in the middle fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film but i enjoyed it anyways grade b
<START> i will not vote this movie as an awful one mainly because i kind of like it i was one of those summer days that i was so lame to do anything and decided do rent a movie in the stupid section of the videostore besides that i didn't slept in the nigh before and the movie got me awake let's just start the autopsy ok the movie haves a strange plot first is isolation there is an expedition they get isolated in an island because there is no gas on the boat something like that there is not a single convincing performance on the actors part so far the main problem starts after the isolation idea the pov of a snake then another then another then snakes that change then false spooks a lot of them and when we believe the movie is going on a good way for a b flick keeping the suspense it fails because after ten or eleven spooks we don't get carried away the one scene that all is the scene when we witness a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes that seem to dance after this it's becoming not a horror adventure but a comedy driven movie the adventure part is discarded also br br for me the problem in a movie is the third act it is the one section that just drives the movie for a already guessed conclusion or if it succeeds we don't noticed it like a ninja smoke in our eyes well snake island haves a bad conclusion it all comes to a the ending with a confront persecution and escape sequence it was predictable in the moment i rented the dam copy the other real problem is concept concept is very important it is the reason you believe in dinosaurs coming to life or a corpse full of stitches that just wants to live the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades on torture by the human civilization well hmmm just doesen't glues on the wall one thing you will enjoy if you watch it with an opened mind is the more b z sequences naked lesbian girls some amateur camera angles the braindead homage with the grass cutter the black dude doesen't die first and thats all if you want to see snakes black dudes and comedy and you prefer bigger budgets go and see on a br br hasta moviegoers
<START> the characterization in this movie is among the worst i've ever encountered the dialogue is trite and clichÃ© to the point of extreme distraction none of the issues the characters face are developed at all they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point also the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired i find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a book or so it is implied in one scene so he can teach it to his daughter etc br br the smile train is a great organization and it's a nice idea to make a heartstring tugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids' lives but overall i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything
<START> the railway children was on tv again this weekend and i had forgotten how good it was br br if i have a criticism it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little however br br i won't revisit the comments of others other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the single most emotional scene in the history of british cinema as a cynical old git passing through middle age rather too quickly i too find i cannot even think of that moment without being hit with a severe case of i've got something in my eye in fact it's not just something in my eye it moves things around inside me too with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel br br and jenny agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this film standing with one foot in childhood and one in young womanhood and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up rather too quickly br br plus a quick for bernard cribbins regarded mostly as a lightweight actor he deftly created a perks of great humanity
<START> the plot in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a y chromosome targeting virus a hot female genetic engineer a man in a lab is intriguing despite the somewhat promising premise the movie falls flat in nearly every regard the dialogue is laughable the characters are paper thin the exploration of a single gender world is shallow the worst part of the entire movie is the asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit br br i can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced most of the movie is male bashing all men are violent all men rape women men are only animals all of the women even the hetero seem to display anger toward fear of and hatred for men if you want to see a sci fi film something along the lines of this movie's premise you'd do best to look elsewhere
<START> the dead spots and picture postcard superficiality of out of africa just about buried any interest i might have had to read so when my brother bought me babette's feast and knowing it was based on a story i didn't exactly race to the vcr but as the titles rolled it became clear that this was no ordinary movie jutland where it's set is not africa the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting the cold forbidding sea the heavy gray clouds the pale icy green cliffs translate to hardships that show on the faces over which director gabriel axel draws the curtain the is as philippa amid the myriad merits of this movie the most memorable is that face it stands like a map laying before us the cherished wonder of her minister father's like a maze of long overlooked where the complications of her perseverance and commitment hang like gleaming br br i gather it's point how the world is drawn inexplicably to christian dedication when philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor because he fears he'll never measure up to the rules and rigors of her small religious clique and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent i figure it's also her point that christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success sister martina rebuffs efforts by a visiting baritone jean philippe lafont whose creates an uplifting counterpoint to the of spirit that surrounds his discovery to turn her into an opera star the title character leaves france and an enviable reputation and seeks sanctuary as the servant of two spinster sisters to pursue artistic triumphs for only god and those closest to him to witness but it's axel who weaves the of these people's lives with the richness of voice and babette table and effects a sumptuousness you'd never expect from a movie about sacrifice faith and religious conviction br br what sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor babette's feast that is the banquet itself a posthumous of the minister's 100th birthday is a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are unparalleled in their subtlety it's just this deft comedy that enriches the solemn sentiments at closing together they do something pious movies seldom do they leave a believer hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humbled
<START> dolemite is for me an object of my deepest affection it's got everything a gang of karate fighting prostitutes dolemite punching his fist through willie green's director martin stomach high pumps and 100 gallon dalmation print hats moore's unique comedy raps actually toasts are close to the roots of hip hop no wonder dr dre mentioned dolemite 3 times on his classic album the chronic add the best list of characters to ever grace a movie like the horny preacher the hamburger pimp and of course the one who no one knows until it's time credit should be given for style to director martin a fella who doesn't get as much attention as he should around film fan circles i've been looking for a copy of his and fred movies from the early 70s for years and can't find them br br a lot of people are really down on this movie and say it's really bad and it is true that you can see boom mikes appearing everywhere look to dp nicholas josef von sternberg for whom i think this was a very early effort there are a lot of things going for this movie number one there is no other movie like it number two you get to see rudy ray moore do a highly sanitized everyone who hasn't seen moore's outrageous live act will have to use their imaginations cinematic version of his toasts plus him living the life of his comic book character come to life the action scenes are pretty poor but the characters' dialogue when they're talking trash more than makes up for it it's full of strange little details like the fact that the hamburger pimp is wearing a dolemite t shirt inside out was this intentional or did the guy just pick up whatever shirt was lying on the set and put it on that keep you coming back to watch it again and again br br at least i have br br
<START> warning may contain spoilers br br the ripples in the wake of the first jaws movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience ie the ocean deep space genetics although jaws was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original shark rosso aka devil fish or red ocean is a dutiful follower of the original jaws formula after several hapless boats and are brutally murdered by some ocean creature there is an initial drive to discover the beast then a failure to study it without horrible results and a final push to destroy it although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy the result is nothing short of disastrous this movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing brittle acting and cheap scares br br the most sickly compelling feature of devil fish is its cookie cutter editing from the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility it appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music furthermore every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms fade wipe or dissolve the impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time lapse image of their act is composited over their bodies br br the music is equally bland the creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the jaws theme with slight variation although i like to keep my reviews devoid of mst3k influence mike most aptly described the somber score as soft core porn music failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to devil fish the acting is stale the relationships baffling and the whole conspiracy is laughable the question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests why couldn't a more practical use be administered to better mankind one of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster even though its film presence is less than stellar br br overall this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre if jaws had never been made then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively sadly as a carbon copy of spielberg's original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese
<START> what annoys me with so called programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live of years ago firstly nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions billions of years old it's a shallow theory based on inaccurate dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot br br secondly nobody can prove that evolution ever happened all darwin's missing links are still missing if you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth they are complete animals of a certain kind eg a dog or a cat nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a bird br br this is utter hogwash there's more proof that santa claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal br br all the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it was created br br this series is not science it is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science science is something we can observe and repeat what you are seeing here is science fiction br br if you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program then rather watch star trek or star wars
