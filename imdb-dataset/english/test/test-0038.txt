<START> the film begins with a little girl rita seeing her father killed he apparently was a criminal who on his fellow crooks later and this part makes little sense the girl has grown to adulthood and still her father's past haunts her a bit later rita meets a good for nothing and dates him during one of their dates he's a bit intoxicated and driving like a total fool the cops give chase and he speeds away killing a pedestrian in the meantime here comes the really stupid part he convinces her to confess to the crime as he assures her his lawyers can get her off scot free why oh why would she agree to this yet she does and spends the next couple years in prison and soon after her conviction this boyfriend disappears showing that he's a total heel what a chump later after her release her friend jack la rue informs her about the truth about the boyfriend then he explains the boyfriend's family is loaded and she should shake them down for lots of cash for all the trouble he put her to by taking the rap frankly this does make sense as they certainly owe it to her especially since they knew she'd go to prison and had every intention of using her and then casting her aside br br now the idea of bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good plot idea however there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because it's hard to believe anyone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hit and run in an interesting twist the dumb lady decides on a life of crime donning a wig and picking up a rich guy taking him into the desert and robbing him at gunpoint wow how she's changed apparently she loves the idea of stealing from phonies i e rich hypocrites however and this made no sense she soon stopped doing this and began shaking down the father of the old boyfriend why she bothered to do some petty robberies in the meantime made little sense and what also was a bit hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from the old jerk she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob controlled man for mayor odd very very odd br br in the meantime another plot develops involving a young alan ladd he's an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mob he was chosen because he just happens to be a dead ringer for a real crook what a clichÃ© but what makes no sense is that this real crook isn't in jail and is out committing crimes while the fake one is infiltrating the mob in another town br br eventually evidence that ladd is able to uncover is enough to issue warrants to the mob kingpins including rita this is a case of very bad timing as in the interim she's made a decision to become a decent and legitimate woman as she's met a really nice guy who she wants to marry wow what are the odds overall this is a goofy and rather dumb movie that suffers from kitchen sink syndrome in other words there is way too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie the least bit believable plus since the movie is only a little over an hour long it all seems very forced and contrived it's a relatively bad b movie from crap studio prc of note only for the performance of alan ladd just before he gained great fame the following year at paramount br br by the way this dvd was released by alpha video a company which sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles mostly public domain but which never cleans up the prints or adds closed captions in other words the dvd production values are strictly 3rd rate at best
<START> a bigoted soldier kills a man for being jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier not as good as the novel it was based on the brick foxhole in which it was a gay man who was killed but hollywood wouldn't touch that in 1947 that said it's still a very good film the anti semitism is handled very well but it's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad well duh but this was 1947 the picture is well acted by the entire cast especially robert young and robert ryan and the tone is very dark as it should be very atmospheric too a deserved big hit in its day well worth seeing
<START> i have been looking for this mini series for a very long time i saw this movie when i was living in back in russia many years ago i'm curious if somebody who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy i'm willing to cover all the expenses and pay for the extra tapes or dvds this is one of the best tv series that i have ever watched i would recommend it to anybody who is somewhat interested in israel history and world history after wwii i'm also trying to find a book i have heard that its even better than the movie however the new one costs around 50 on amazon and i have never purchased a used copy my e mail address is hotmail com thank you very much for you help
<START> so many fans so little to show for it i know i know these words are gonna find me in a great minority a lot of people really liked good will hunting but seriously please great film making not even close and let's put the blame where it belongs in the writing br br now i know they won an oscar for it and boy did they look good emoting on the screen but good will hunting is an abc after school special with lots of cursing in it and a slightly bigger budget br br what this movie does show is the brilliance of harvey weinstein and miramax pictures mr weinstein could take manure feed it to you and make you believe your eating bon and that's exactly what the studio did with the film they created such high buzz around it that people believed and wanted to believe it so much that they saw brilliance where there was none br br now i know some people think it's a great movie i don't think it's a horribly bad movie i like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies and also to some great made for tv movies although not hbo films hbo films are unusually better than good will hunting would ever be it's just a nice little film with some good performances robin williams was not good in it they just gave him the oscar cause been itching to do it for a while and of course the miramax public relations machine secured ben and matt their screenwriting oscar but come one people there's better movies out there
<START> thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since quentin tarantino took the genre by storm with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in the early nineties but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location it works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller there is little substance to be found within the plot but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life affirming experience the plot follows casey a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife the pair wants to adopt a child but things turn awry when casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime nick who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal br br the first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect we see a coffee order go wrong which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments the scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie thursday is a very funny film and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike it's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table cinematically or plot wise but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters the acting is decent enough with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot thomas jane holds the film together well in the lead role while amusing portrayals from james legros michael jeter glenn plummer and mickey rourke back him up nicely this film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances thursday is likely to suffice
<START> another asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well major spoiler warning br br the movie starts pretty simple two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother especially the elder one and they seem to ignore their father all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister revealed when the stepmother actually the sister's alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there br br finally my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack very creepy 7 out of 10
<START> may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news everything is already happened a great tsunami looms over a city bay and cut no more to see suffers a large earthquake did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw if you want to make a love story make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title do please be kind enough to show me the disaster pd after watching this movie watch or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original and i even like the latest poseidon not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence new looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly i know i must sound like a sadistic freak however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film even sensei makes me cry and this movie didn t there is also a tv series called napping made in 1975 i have on dvd and it is much better
<START> sadly this movie did have potential with such a willing cast but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud as it did here also i don't think i've ever seen a stoner sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery the last time i was this stunned at how un funny a comedy can be was with the awful big momma's house scene after scene these movies will turn your brain into jelly silly and stupid can sometimes be funny but here silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer an absolute rock bottom dud
<START> let me begin by saying that i adore the book and loved the a e miniseries i was hoping to love this film and i was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and the actual story however this film scarcely resembles the original book if only the names had been changed to protect the innocent i would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining if inaccurate period piece br br unfortunately putting the name mr darcy on a character who is emotional and weak giving the name elizabeth bennett to a reckless snippy often teary eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society and making mr a wide eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read jane austen's original story br br there are some really stellar moments in this movie perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent charlotte's explanation of why she accepted mr collins' proposal begins beautifully she is 27 years old quite near the hopeless spinster age in those times she is becoming a burden on her family and she is not romantic she only wants a comfortable home however the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers don't you judge me elizabeth don't you dare judge me and runs off in tears later you see charlotte to lady catherine de which was not at all in her character as described in the book br br another good moment is when darcy catches elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle it was well done in the a e series but the film version with keira knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for elizabeth very nice br br the ending also illustrated a level of affection between elizabeth and darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries i actually appreciated that scene simply because i like to see a happy ending rather than just know that it took place br br altogether though this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of austen's pride and prejudice the characters speak in a jarring combination of austen's dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version yes time was a concern it's only a short movie yada yada but turning a complex beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous br br some have commented that they loved the moment when darcy first sees elizabeth because it is so obviously a case of love at first sight love at first sight huh one of the best aspects of the book is that elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty and darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness he literally loves her for her mind br br this version also had a moment during first proposal when the two are yelling furiously at each other while leaning closer and closer and almost kissing but they suddenly step apart ugh what a sad clichÃ© they're angry and disgusted with each other but so attracted that it doesn't matter that at the time they don't even like each other ridiculous br br the characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story mr bennet was dour elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters charlotte was emotional somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own unlike the intelligent slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel jane and elizabeth's relationship is merely topical instead of the deep rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other br br all this i could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel but i refused to accept all that in addition to the many many historical inaccuracies miss walked around scarcely clothed her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments elizabeth walked to with her hair down and allowed to fly all over the family lazed about one morning though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances or being called on at your own home elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown and in a really appalling scene walked into jane's bedroom and conversed with her and sounded like an idiot when she was ill br br most people would feel these are minor points but i simply wanted either a an historically accurate film or b an accurate representation of the characters in the novel br br the director writer whoever sacrificed accuracy subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight i can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie and there is nothing wrong with that i simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces
<START> 1956's the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment to those who prefer the 1934 original i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier however even though the american version was heaven forbid a big budget blockbuster i believe it blows the british version out of the water i think this is one of hitchcock's 10 best no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to love br br 1 james stewart america's favorite everyman for so many years does an excellent job playing the distressed father here he can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison br br 2 doris day yes doris day despite all the criticisms directed toward her i think she makes the loving wife mother an extremely sympathetic person i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is soft spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is docile and helpless i don't want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go and i loved que sera sera i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard and deservedly won its oscar it elevated the film to another level br br 3 the albert hall sequence i don't think it was too long at all i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant and the assassin was truly frightening br br 4 the ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again the last line in the film is highly amusing i don't think the film started out slowly was trying to get us to know and like the and he did a great job i wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing hank but i didn't have a problem with him since hank was ben and jo's kid i cared about him too it's not like he was a brat or anything br br i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues way to go hitch
<START> i guess my husband and i are a little slow we don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life in this case we didn't start watching until almost the 6th season i'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long other than the fact that we are not big fans of appointment tv viewing our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on and we didn't have a dvr yet so i guess it wasn't until tbs starting running reruns on their daily lineup in the evenings that we started watching consistently br br by the time we got hooked there were only a couple more season's left before the series was canceled but we still watch it almost daily on tbs i almost prefer to see series this way because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week br br but the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories don't carry over from week to week but that is fine with me because you can watch an episode then miss weeks and still pick back up br br my only criticism is the writing wasn't always consistent some episodes would be outrageously hilarious and then some would only be mildly funny so i'm not sure it had the quality of writers that seinfeld or raymond had but i loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic kevin james is just plain funny to look at so even if the plot isn't that great james body language and expressions make the show worth watching leah is great as the play it straight wife i think its harder to play the straight character for laughs than the comedic character and she does a great job she has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else she is one tough cookie and who can forget arthur as carrie's dad who lives with them in their basement br br this a great series and i was sorry when it cancelled but a big thanks to tbs for keeping the king alive in reruns
<START> critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie but i actually didn't think it was too bad even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap and i normally despise pg 13 horror films so this means one of two things either 1 i'm too easily pleased and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years or 2 'when a stranger calls' isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be now to be fair some of the criticisms of the movie are true there's not much character development and not much happens in the story but man alive folks how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked cut them some slack as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo who knows i guess stuff like this just gives me the willies br br yes i admit i had fun watching this and i don't care how big of a minority that puts me in
<START> if one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now it has been done judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well i cannot remember one funny scene though i have to admit i had to turn it off before it was finished i did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well if you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper stick your head in a pile of manure and breath deeply
<START> i wasn't surprised to read a comment by the director to the effect that she made this film as an antidote to all those making of dvd featurettes as that certainly struck me i do confess that i have a penchant for meta but i found this film to be very accessible and entertaining and not even in a labored self consciously clever way which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a film about film making it is very french in that there are a great deal of outlandish yet occasionally compelling theories about how film making and even sexuality works but since the director doesn't quite play herself using an avatar instead we're left with a lot of choices since i'm pretty sure she's constantly contradicting herself apparently catherine specializes in hard to watch films but i'd definitely say this one doesn't qualify i really enjoyed the dialog the balance between the cinematic and the natural the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor and so on highly recommended
<START> nothing but the void a pleasant one for those who have known the eighties but well quite boring for those who are not interested in it no screenplay in this film but a hero wandering in an underground new york full of and night clubbers it is aimless pointless and naive but not entirely unpleasant
