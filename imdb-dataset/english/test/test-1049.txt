<START> the first bottom movie was an absolute laugh from the beginning excellently made and thought out i will definitely take my hat off to the production team and the actors the bottom actors attempt to run a hotel if you look closely this film was most probably shot in the isle of wight near my home
<START> this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch i just don't like that so called realistic camera work that is being done nowadays you know the type jumping off center panning around etc what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint
<START> i saw this movie for a first time years ago when it was still new and i was satisfied it's a great hollywood make belief story for teenagers however it's not lifelike as much as you would want to believe it these stories never happen that's why it is irritating to watch movies like that they play with teenagers' minds just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed i wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors yes they actors were good but the idea isn't worth a 10 there are a lot of films about teenagers so why don't we make a better one
<START> to call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement br br the acting was unconvincing to say the least especially from actor craig fong who couldn't have acted stiffer as far as story goes well what story the film is nominally about harry lee a malaysian of chinese descent who comes back to his home country after flunking out of every course he took and tries to start a band br br the film has ever cliche you can think of sex tension among band members and a little bit of racial tension thrown in br br the problem is that even with a subject that's been covered adequately by even the most amateurish directors this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels contrived with parts that would make even the most hardened reviewers' hairs stand on end br br
<START> if anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen there are different aspects a sports movie can take whether it be professional or college or high school examples of sports movies i liked and i haven't seen many are jim all american all the right moves any given sunday eight men out and rocky among others all of those movies had a little more than just plain sports whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach or the effect of money on professional sports in hoosiers there is not much content it didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end there was no character development all of them were forced on us i could sum up this movie by quoting a very bad coach go out and try to score more points than the other guy
<START> it is the early morning of our discontent and some friends of mine and i have just gotten through watching the wind truly a disaster film not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting populace but rather an awful movie wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting audience to give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb i'll give you an example quoted during my first pained viewing if given the choice of watching this movie for a second time and say boiling myself i'm afraid to say the choice would not be an immediate one but rather than simply ranting ad with lousy one liners i'm going to get specific as to why exactly my friends and i panned this particular film br br to start this off i like low budget horror flicks i even like artsy low budget horror flicks i liked cold hearts midnight mass jugular wine etc films that were ambitious and daring even if they were lacking in production value execution and even acting generally an interesting premise unusual camera technique or merely just a well done scene or two will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges with these in mind i would like to say conclusively that i hated the wind br br the movie was probably most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch from the actions of the main characters to the flow of the plot to the big portents hinted at by the opening which ultimately aspired to dust and did not even attach themselves logically to what transpired in the remainder of the film and left the viewer expecting something more with a sense of much ado about nothing the dialogue was spotty at best woodenly delivered and completely unrealistic by this i mean no one in any of the situations that the characters were in would have reacted the way the characters did or said the things that they said in the way that they said them there was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem br br character interaction and development was abysmal claire the sex goddess or so the aggravating passive aggressive in the movie thought was so overt in her manipulations she may as well have pulled a gun on the characters nevertheless she was the shining high point of the film the other main characters with the exception of mick's mom who was not terrible are so that they may as well have been portrayed by the same actor let's see if i missed anything borderline personality co submissive goons with profound feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy spurred to fits of puerile rage through the artless orchestrations of a loose lipped suddenly and turned caligari no i think that about covers it br br lack of scope was also problematic how did those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to derive that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish unbelievable poorly portrayed lust pentagon well what would you call it that occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere there were no witnesses to the atrocities presented there were no witnesses anywhere in this film br br the believability problems stemming from this lack of attention to detail were rife even from the point where the plot begins to sicken case in point if that guy bob took that route through the woods to come home from the gym and here's the key every day there's a jolly good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards while the perpetrators argued about the crime scene one would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods said town would have been in an uproar the characters would have been questioned etc but instead there wasn't a witness in sight other than earl the closet psychopath with no inner monologue we suggest that there be no witnesses for this film either br br as for the quasi homosexual meanderings present i don't have a problem with those either it's not as if they came as a surprise considering we had been shouting as to the closet case of most of the male characters since the second scene again not problematic in and of itself but thrown in for the wrong reasons it was utterly unnecessary thrown in for pure shock and or dangerous art value and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective what we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring clumsy movie with a boring clumsy plot the poorly hinted at sexual tension which was only hinted at heavy handedly in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene only pushed this film further down the totem pole from mediocrity warranting criticism to film sucking so bad that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to properly mock and harangue br br so it is with most of the film a lot of artistic fumbling very little meat and a lot of aggravation it's not that we don't get it oh we got it alright we just don't want it look the very fact that we were cheering the bludgeoning in the final scene as the only tableau that made sense on its face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film rather than moving briskly along as its name implies this movie oozed languidly forward like the sweat trail working it's way down the side of your nose while your hands are full argh that sensation pretty well sums up the gut wrenching frustration realized while watching this train wreck there is no breath of fresh air with regard to this movie only the stale miasma of bad ideas poorly realized before coming to fruition
<START> me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie bad idea we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit but our expectations fell extremely short first of all the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies the movie started out slow for the first 1 1 2 hours reminder its about two hours long and when it finally started to gain momentum it sucked plus the plots were very hard to follow it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other if your a person who likes sick twisted unusual movies then go for it but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back no one told us that
<START> a skillfully directed film by martin ritt where a drifter and anti hero john cassevetes lands in n y to escape a tragic incident in his life where he killed his brother in an automobile accident as well as going awol from the army br br cassavetes always an intense actor shows grit in his portrayal of a film am surprised that montgomery clift didn't get this part br br ruth white is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the telephone br br once in new york he befriends sidney poitier as the two work on the docks immediately jack warden a bully and villain in this film takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when poitier tries to defend his friend br br ruby dee plays poitier's wife in this film and is brilliant in a scene where she urges cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband br br this is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society with the backdrop of tenements the right mood is depicted in the film
<START> cardiff wales a bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town there's jip who works in a clothes shop coop an easy going dj nina inseparable from her best friend lulu and the week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing the week end at this time they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music they experience different drugs particularly ecstasy then they usually continue the party to a friend's at the end of this really good time on sunday the feelings are the following ones tiredness melancholy just the memory of a crazy night br br surfing on the wave of the notorious success of trainspotting 1996 this debut movie written and directed by justin kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism it means how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time indeed as i have previously written for the 5 main characters of the movie the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure besides jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself you are numb you don't feel any pressure you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth kerrigan's relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care of the 5 protagonists they only live to take advantage as much as possible of an hedonist week end furthermore to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes kerrigan isn't afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters' fantasy or embarrassments then human traffic 1999 is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track the amount a perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music at last this week end of euphoria enables to momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes british cinema has studied a lot br br notwithstanding when a movie or not exploits the fame of another famous one it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor human traffic is in this condition there's little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions jip who in the nightclub goes in the manager's office and tells him a cock and bull story so as to enable to enter the club but that's no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems one can also blame kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved his movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole aren't virtually explored it's a shame it could have conveyed the following message even in the happiest moments there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them the same remark could also be said when coop has a fit of jealousy because nina broaches a guy br br it may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the dvd cover but human traffic is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble an ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club
<START> when i first saw this film on video in a department store it intrigued me considering the fact that i thought i was in love and i was the same age as the youths in this film at the time although i realize they are now old enough to be my parents plus the soundtrack being written by elton john bernie taupin just before they made it big here in north america i figured i had nothing to lose in buying it i was not disappointed br br so far i have shown it to many guys i have dated since and to my current boyfriend obviously they didn't find it as lovely as i do preferring to call it a chick movie but i still laugh and cry this film was vastly overlooked it's good to see it's available to rent at one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic br br so maybe it's a bit far fetched but it gives you a lighthearted sense of innocence and a renewed faith in love
<START> this is just about the worst piece of garbage i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through the story was embarrassingly amateurish the graphics were horrible and the acting i've never seen worse acting in my entire life a kindergarten class could come up with a scarier better written and more entertaining concept than this i pity anyone who wastes their time on this film as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job it was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction the writers must have spent their time at film school in the back room playing a lot of professors wasted a lot of time on these two i would be truly embarrassed to admit that i knew them
<START> after my 6 year old daughter began taking riding lessons i started looking for horse movies for her i had always heard of national velvet but had never seen it boy am i glad i bought it it's become a favorite of mine my 6 year old and my 2 year old it's a shame movies like this aren't made anymore
<START> a coach who used to be good but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did a team of no hopers the star player who has a row with the coach the assistant coach with an alcohol problem the little guy who gets kicked around scoring the winning basket the whole town against the coach all except for the leading lady it's the old story right out of the british comic books where a team of geeks and take on the brazilians at soccer and win br br this film admittedly well put together is full of these clichÃ©s the only part i didn't predict was when at the town meeting the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach no reason was ever given it seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy br br gene hackman plays a locker room doyle i am sure that an actor of dennis hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role the same can be said about barbara hershey br br all in all a film full of clichÃ©s that might have been done a lot better than it was
<START> as a veteran screen writing instructor at college in dallas and a former mgm screenwriter back in the days of decent films i am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on channel 33 in dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which betty white is gorgeous and makes one yearn for the good old days of truly good movies before hollywood started banging out all this crap for the teenagers if a producer is listening i'd like to state that there are enough of us over 60's who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns no killing no special effects no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling as this film did for me
<START> after kenneth rousing story of the invigorated me back into the pleasure of reading during grade school i had high hopes for this series the story of an underdog bat across country to reunite with his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imagination upon hearing of this series i began browsing animation's site and liked what i saw the character design looked impressive and the fast paced plot seemed to have been stretched respectably across a thirteen episode arc much was my disappointment then when i decided to watch a rerun early one morn br br the opening episode shows our hero shade pursuing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night an song we see a nifty if crude cgi effect illuminate the moth and the chase takes on a frenetic turn as the tiny insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself do deceive its pursuer as a lover of biology i had a decent understanding of the principles in place tiger moths can sense the sounds their predators use for and spin a sonic cover for themselves but without such exposition i would have surely been lost a minor quibble i thought surely they director will fill us in momentarily i waited in vain br br once our protagonist down with some of his fellows we are treated to some of the dullest dialog i've ever seen on television childhood rival begin taunting the diminutive hero with the stupidest lines i've ever seen on a show i can understand the writers not producing shakespeare but one would think they'd have had some social contact in their lives surely enough to make communication seem natural oh how wrong i was br br the voice acting while not horrendous hardly was a shining example of human achievement oh shade you're broken the law mother sighs emptily you must come with me young one frieda the wizened elder of the colony the actors try but it hardly matters at this point as the story becomes less and less compelling with each pass minute br br while each episode deals with a problem of the week as is typical of with most television series overarching story arcs the saga for better and worse while the main point of the story is reunion with his family later episodes tack on other story arcs involving cannibalistic bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds and beasts the writers try to do too much at once fighting to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hopes that it will grab audience interest enough to keep the bloody show going on unfortunately these attempts are futile to all but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed br br while it's nice to see canadian media be perpetuated it would be all the sweeter if the enjoyability of the series wasn't limited to the immediate family of the animators or frothing fans of kenneth books there are worse things out there your children could be watching than but far better programs are out there too pass on the mediocrity and read the books instead
