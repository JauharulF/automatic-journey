<START> there are spoilers usual slasher film with the story taking place in and around this god forsaken mine outside the almost deserted town of after receiving a letter map and gold nugget from her brother jared shadrach smith clair and her husband nick carrie sean hines drive to the village together with four other friends and armature gold prospectors tori steve and hayden rox ann rick elina to stake their claim br br it later turns out that the fact that jared disturbed the long forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious stone vernon wells to come back to life and with that restart his reign of terror stone or is about the most ridicules slasher killer in motion picture history stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal runs around with this hook slicing people in two after doing in almost the entire cast local hermit aunt nelly karen black who's daughter eve alexandra ford was also one of stone's victims tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the stone mine the crazed miner will never rest until he kills all those who still have it br br aunt nelly is given just enough time to tell her story before she's turned into a human torch by stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream the movie goes on endlessly with the killer miner on the rampage looking like he's about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him in one scene when he broke into aunt nelly's house everyone inside all charged instead of running away him causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner's pick attached to his stump br br besides actress karen black the film miners massacre also has veteran actors john phillip law and richard lynch as the town sheriff murphy and old man prichard passable stuff but nothing special the movie has a predictable ending with the entire gold mine going up in flames the audience given a hint by the makers of miners massacre that the end to this mindless lunacy is nowhere in sight and may very well resurface in the very near future in a possible sequel god help us all
<START> a washed up reporter called bart pat o' blackmails gang boss heinz webber george for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them br br typical poverty row b pic of the time directed for far more than it's worth by terence fisher who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio the script is far fetched and teen idol tommy steele guitar in hand was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called the rebel at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang's activities
<START> john candy was very much a hit or miss comic actor his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot but wagons east in which he plays a bumbling who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west is even sadder i don't understand why it was even released the story is pointless and weak and the jokes aren't there it saddens me even further that candy's last film would be his all time worst movie so let's forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck br br 0 out of 5
<START> dr lucio fulci lucio fulci is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes he visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles this proves to be a bad idea since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings seizing the opportunity to make fulci his fall guy the loopy nut doctor the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders br br on the surface cat in the brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti splatter god lucio fulci chock full of chainsaw dismemberment axe attacks and various other bloody killings the film certainly spills enough for even the most hardened gore hounds but when one looks closer it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies mostly fulci's own remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted some welcome nudity and dreadful performances from fulci himself and david l thompson as the psycho shrink br br as the film progresses it develops into an incomprehensible mess with the gore footage inserted randomly with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story if you've seen fulci's touch of death and ghost's of or mario bianchi's the murder secret then you've already seen the best bits of cat in the brain before br br after much bloodletting the film wraps itself up rather quickly leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated watch the film if you're a fulci completist but i would suggest seeking out the films from which the 'good were taken
<START> enchanted april was one of harry last movies he only directed a few more after this one he had made the maisie movies in the 1930s and 1940s in the opening credits it says from the novel by elizabeth and completely leaves off the author's last name rather odd but since it was von armin they may not have wanted the german association at the time sad to hear it was a flop when it was released with those fun names like frank morgan the wizard and jessie ralph who played w c fields' disapproving mother in law in bank dick two gals in london ann harding katharine alexander decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends but things don't go the way they planned reginald owen plays the husband with multiple personalities aside from a few funny moments it does move pretty slow ralph is the only bright spot here as the overbearing take charge type and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film the views of italy are all obvious backdrops the only saving grace here is that the turner classic version is only 66 minutes long too bad they didn't give frank morgan a larger role this was remade in 1992 by the bbc as a british film
<START> this second full length lone ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip the ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers there are more killings and violence usually associated with lone ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay the ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice clayton moore and jay star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus country of old tucson to good advantage the music score is good but the familiar william tell overture theme is nudged aside by vocals that are interesting but lack the flourish and beauty of the traditional theme
<START> i saw the movie on its north american premiere july 14 2004 at the fantasia festival i was slightly disappointed as i had been expecting a more epic ensemble cast movie along the lines of musa the warrior instead the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters still the movie was solid thoughtful and visually intriguing there were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties intrigue and blood versus the lighter more flamboyant martial arts sequences it almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts flick or a historical epic the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones how does one decide these questions are raised in this movie and ironically there is the suggestion that the answer given may in fact be the wrong one
<START> well it is a monogram quickie from the dreaded period of the '40s when poverty row studios put out a good many horror films that are almost unimaginably dull so i was expecting the worst br br the story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of non utilitarian electrical devices which spark nicely there is a dog's heart hanging under a bell jar and twitching fitfully which we are informed is proof that his method is perfected br br a brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather undramatic sequence undramatic even with the sparks the important plot point is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived it is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit the haunts of the underworld and become acquainted with certain gangsters br br it's hard to explain why this all is not completely unwatchable but perhaps it suffices to say that it's mildly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters towards the end it even begins to move along with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright hitchcockian spoiler br br i have to warn of a very very bad ending a tagged on unnecessary pain in the ass sorta ending after the plot resolves rather effectively br br you know the sort of thing it's all a dream never happened
<START> spoiler alert br br this was the worst of the series it is horror disguised as political satire and it is as subtle as a sledge hammer not very scary and not very insightful did micheal moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage br br i'm really sick of hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against george bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again this movie wants to be but unlike that movie which subtly poignantly tackled the problems soldiers who came back from vietnam by clever making the main character come back as a blood craving zombie and slowly built on this theme it was a true horror film that was also good social commentary because it didn't get sanctimonious and preachy br br i guess joe dante thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare republicans conservatives and and me being the last in that list found this film to be totally ridiculous manipulative and all at the same time and i don't mean the good type of exploitative that you often find in the drive in type movies i mean exploitative in the most sickening and vile manner using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film br br this film assumes that all the soldiers who died in iraq would vote against a conservative president if they would come back to life as zombies which is a flawed premise because as i recall for the most part and going by george romero's rules zombies are mindless flesh eating creatures operating on pure impulse and even though the zombie andy in could talk he couldn't really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood okay zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and obviously they are dead so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place my interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is by having mindless dead people vote for him i guess they meant to say the people that vote for presidents like george bush are the mindless zombies while the real mindless zombies are actually the ones making the intellectually sounds decisions yeah whatever dawn of the dead tackled this idea much better but user the idea of mindless consumerism this film isn't dawn of the dead by any stretched of the imagination br br the film addresses the issue while the soldiers are alive that a majority of them voted for a bush like president but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti war democrat after they are zombies who are normally considered brain dead creatures and laughably has them destruct after they vote br br if you are gonna make a zombie movie mr dante and invoke george romero's name in it you better have mindless zombies that like ripping people apart and eating their intestines not zombies that vote i also like how the zombies just go evil conservatives who support the war br br if you want a good movie with social commentary skip this poorly made preachy piece of junk and watch instead br br the worst of the master of horror series hands down

<START> it is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists sometimes even without the 20 20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are following is one such look into the past of christopher nolan one of the great time warping story teller of today br br christopher nolan's style of film making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story although people might complain it relies too much on the back and forth shifting of time i still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time memento was probably the most convoluted piece of story telling i have ever seen discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind bender the prestige which was considerably stripped down in comparison still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven even in a jaded enterprise like the batman series did christopher nolan sprinkle some of his outstanding yarn weaving tricks breathing new life into the dark knight br br following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery where we see a dilettante writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes and finally sees an end no one could have expected having never heard of following before i had no idea what i was to expect at every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me since the mystery angle was clear i was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next and that is where i think the film succeeds so well the film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases br br the film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines both of which are considered gimmicky these days following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible there doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is but you don't feel like you are being taken for a ride the lack of pretension or self aware arrogance is what makes this style of story telling work highly recommended
<START> this flick is terrible it sets out to disgust and make you laugh but it fails horribly the director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy and the actors are like nothing i've ever seen lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy even their attempt at the english languish is really sad and actually the down right peculiar swedish accent in which the incoherent dialog is spoken is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film even the gore i awful and unconvincing if you crave gore comedy i'd suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must we all enjoy a bloody good laugh but this is ridiculous
<START> i saw this movie as part of a billy graham program the church i attend was part of a community wide outreach to present god and christianity to our community hartford ct usa i was one of the counselors who helped attendees who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted and to follow up on them after the movie as such it did what it was supposed to do and i personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in god i also found it to be very helpful to those i counseled i especially like the work of kim darby in this movie and the parents the were in a way a little overdrawn no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the did oh no no not that isn't exactly what they said but the audience i saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say and also at the son's emphatic no mom not me don
<START> i went to the cinema slightly apprehensive i came out seething with anger at the garbage passing for a film i had witnessed the actors particularly travolta should be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this clearly the only thing in their minds was the pay cheque never mind the debasement of their talents and us travolta needs to go back to doing some more look who's talking movies as he has sunk back to the level of his pre tarantino work it comes to something when the l w talking sequels are better than this one travolta is no longer the king of cool but the king of corn michael caine himself admitted to doing bad movies for the pay cheque should follow suit if he has any self respect
<START> making a movie about a comic is hard to do making a good movie about a comic is extremely hard to do making a good movie about asterix has been done br br this movie shows that the french do know how to make an a funny b hilarious c beautiful d superb movie the acting is no less than superb the sunny feel to the whole movie is perfect a must see this just has to be the funniest thing to come out since we started the new millenium 10 10
