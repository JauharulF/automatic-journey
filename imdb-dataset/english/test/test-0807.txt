<START> i saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago if you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves it is a little like american pie meets fast times at ridgemont high but with more depth it handles the same issues as both movies but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth the ending is sad but that is how life is i think everyone should see it i have it on dvd form and it took such a long time to find it too that should say something heh and another thing i will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack i believe they stopped it but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing it has songs by artists like the u2 devo the cars kc and the sunshine band and many more
<START> the only reason i rented this movie was that val kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie there is of course a first time for everything in many ways this movie proves that oaters aren't as easy to make as we think especially by foreign directors the only one who got by with it was probably sergio leone but even his movies lacked that something innate to our american psyche and panache american actors in clint eastwood and henry fonda did help i can see now why they changed the original title from summer love to dead man's bounty that itself tells me the producers and director didn't have any core understanding about a western other than those standard shoot'em up scenes and violent themes i suppose we can say the same about american directors attempting to make a polish movie while failing miserably in the process
<START> in crystal city a group of mormons hire the horse traders travis ben johnson and sandy harry carey jr as wagon masters to lead their caravan to san juan river along the journey they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack dr a hall alan mowbray and the prostitutes denver joanne dru and ruth clifford then the sadistic outlaws clegg boys decide to join the mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the sheriff of crystal city that is chasing them when the navajos cross their path they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party when the wagon train is near to their destination the clegg boys threaten the settlers forcing sandy and travis to take an attitude br br wagon master is another great western of john ford the sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive the adventure of the group of mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated my vote is eight br br title brazil dos caravan of the braves
<START> i will not even make any more comments about this movie instead i will make a recommendation for all you euro horror fans if you want to see an enjoyable low budget vampire flick check out engel 1998 it has everything razor blade smile lacks acting nice locations terrific score and less hissing vampires
<START> everything about this movie is bad everything ridiculous 80's haircuts ridiculous moustaches ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that the adversaries do not even hit each other bad bad bad 80's music repeated scenes of people running through woods a bad guy with a silver plastic hand and silly hair stupid dialogue the acting is everything looks extremely cheap this movie even surpasses plan 9 from outer space in its utter badness br br it's not funny bad it's just bad
<START> this spaghetti western uses three american lead actors which takes away a little of the typical spaghetti aura the plot is about an amnesty that the governor of new mexico gives to all willing criminals to provide them a chance to start a new life usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events but in this film it seems more like a licence to kill because even new crimes like e g threatening the governor are forgiven the story is an endless chain of killings where nearly every character has only the purpose to deliver more carcasses only the few leads have stamina clay mccord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where unsurprisingly he killed a lot of people in the middle of the everlasting mayhem this kind of reflections lack credibility compared with similar films like e g none of the characters in this film was likable for me br br apart of the weak content which targets certain customers this film is well shot sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average br br 4 10
<START> george and mildred is a truly unfunny film this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure as is so often the case br br the wit and clever one liners from the tv shows have gone missing the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs br br die hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair's output mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released but others should invest their time more wisely
<START> i'll say one thing for herman usa it will probably always play well to minnesota audiences i can't imagine that there's another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of or a line like i knew there was something wrong with iowa guys would bring down the house i actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so basically a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors is suitors a gender specific word it ain't progressive to be sure but it's sorta charming in its own right pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband overall it's just too cloying for its own good but you've got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with kevin build a nude love scene i will always applaud the depiction of people who don't meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual caring human beings but that's not enough to redeem herman usa to paraphrase jello it's nostalgia for an age that never existed
<START> this film was released in the uk under the name blood rites it was banned outright and never submitted again for release br br as the ghastly ones it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of new york city's famed 42nd street grindhouse circuit if you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this film br br unfortunately to see the disabled colin hal chomp down on a live rabbit you have to put up with shaky 16mm camera work that makes ed wood look positively marvelous br br three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is naturally in such a situation people start dropping dead family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled especially during a gruesome dismemberment br br maybe it was the bunny bit that the brits objected to i know i did
<START> while not truly terrible this movie is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys history br br basically this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho in fact none of the characters is developed beyond a one dimensional parody but this is a tv movie so what do you expect mike love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius yeah as if br br on the plus side the music is excellent unlike the previous beach boys made for tv bio pic summer dreams this movie actually features real beach boys music rather than anemic cover versions also it features a surprising number of beach boys related rarities and seldom heard tracks the i live for the sun being but one example br br this movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top by the time part two rolls around the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs but how could anyone take this crap seriously if you're not a beach boys fan you probably won't get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and one sided view of the band's history but then again why would you watch this if you weren't a fan
<START> masters horror sounds like is set in seattle where larry pearce works as the manager of a computer software call center having lost his 6 year old son michael nicholas elia to a rare heart condition he finds that he has ultra sensitive hearing larry hears everything in ten fold from people typing on computer keyboards people whispering across the room people tapping their foot on the floor dripping taps eventually even people breathing become unbearable for larry as he is constantly bombarded with mind piercing noise eventually larry decides he's had enough if he can't stop the noises themselves then maybe he can stop himself hearing them with the help of a large meat clever br br this canadian american co production was episode 4 from season 2 of the generally hit and miss masters of horror tv series written directed by brad anderson i thought sounds like was a definite miss the script was based on a short story by mike i am genuinely surprised by the amount of very positive comments it has here on the imdb at the present time for a start i would be very hard pressed to even describe this as a horror film it feels more like some bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes when howard berger gregory nicotero the boys at knb effects actually get to do some work larry has this strange unexplained ability to amplify sound noises from the start so this episode ends up like 55 minutes of exactly the same sort of repetitive build up which leads up to a gory ending although it comes to late to save the episode this is pretty slow going while it's well written isn't this meant to be horror themed i'm slightly confused as to who this is meant to appeal to br br director anderson does ok but he just keeps repeating the same things over over again until the last 5 minutes there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing there's no horror there's no scares or tension absolutely no atmosphere br br technically this is very well made has good production values doesn't look like a cheap made for tv program the acting is very good actually it's shame the story is somewhat limited br br sounds like is one of the very worst masters of horror episodes a lot of people seem to like it that's fine but it's definitely not for me another masters of horror another disappointment
<START> give h g lewis points he managed to incorporate beefy exotic dancers gallons of his notorious fake blood and henny youngman all in one movie the gore gore girls was lewis's horror film swan song and ends with a head being squashed by an automobile oh henny plays a surly night club owner whose girls are falling prey to lewis's standard butchery
<START> i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon i've seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single non lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings br br this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for good br br the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for films so it doesn't grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objects br br very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul
<START> the acting was bad and the plot well i don't think there was one br br some fat blonde chap who is always dressed in a dinner suit kidnaps a sort from a nightclub i think he then kills a copper pointless fights then happen kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat why tough uncompromising martial arts trained cop turns up speaks bad english and does stuff that does not make sense its utter tripe but he does have a nice car christ on a bike this film was a waste of 90 minutes
<START> sam lion jean paul belmondo discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death when he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need he gets albert duvivier richard to help them in search of his own past of his own desires this fabulous film by claude lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age br br built like all lelouch films the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling especially scenes where paul belmondo who looks a huge lot like his father is playing a young sam lion while sam lion stands in the same room a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp br br one of lelouch's most elaborate works d'un infant gate is a must see tale of self fulfilment
