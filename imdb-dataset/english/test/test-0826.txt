<START> why would burt lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook who is ultimately undermined by femme fatale anna dundee played by yvonne decarlo in the same reason why robert mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls for femme fatale faith domergue in the 1950 noir where danger lives perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had as playing against type the usual 'tough guy' role they were known for would enhance their image as actors who could play any role but the problem was that roles like steve thompson the pathetic love sick milquetoast in did nothing to enhance lancaster's career not only is lancaster completely miscast in the one note role of thompson but there's something inherently unlikeable and may i say pathetic about the film's protagonist in the first place br br is an interminably slow moving film among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is at the beginning the flashback which chronicles thompson's confrontation with dan duryea's dundee at the nightclub everything that occurs in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture the illicit affair between steve and anna steve's strained relationship with martinez the cop and his bad blood with dundee if director siodmark felt compelled to begin the film with a flashback why not keep it under three minutes i think it would have been more effective br br in it takes quite awhile before the protagonist commits himself and steps out of the 'ordinary' world of act one that's the scene where he's passing by' and anna at the nightclub and notice how siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between anna dancing and steve staring at her in addition to the cross cutting he also spends a great deal of time focusing on morales and his band than moving the story along br br up until the crisis of act two the story plods along with thompson having various uneasy encounters with anna and then drowning his sorrows at his usual watering hole at the midpoint of act two he learns that anna has run off and gotten married to dundee it's becoming more clear at this point that one of the film's central weaknesses is that dundee is never on screen throughout most of the second act there are no confrontations between thompson and dundee during this time and we're left with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovebirds as it turns out and anna 'explains' this later to steve the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months but she also felt pressure from steve's mother as well direct threats from martinez the cop who implied that he would see to it that she ended up in the women's house of detention anna goes back to steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with turns out that he's been beating her and she's now scared of him br br one of the silly refrains uttered by more than one character in criss cross is that you can never hijack an armored car but everyone acts so surprised when steve points out it can be done if it's an 'inside job' you would have thought that dundee would have known about steve's as an armored car driver and propositioned him beforehand but of course steve needs to make the proposal so that dundee won't kill him after discovering his affair with anna if they're so afraid at getting caught why do steve and anna meet at his apartment where dundee can so easily find them i really got a kick out of played by alan napier the of the operation dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic ex professor type who plots out the heist on a map oh there is the matter of procuring the ingredients to construct the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course is good at that too br br the only really well done scene in the entire film is the armored car robbery the editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a heist gone bad as the gas bombs go off the brutality of the gang is shown in high relief when dundee murders the innocent armored car guard br br the climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film why does it take so long for one of goons to kidnap thompson there's that nurse then the goon is waiting outside then he comes in and pretends that he's a friend steve falls asleep and finally after he awakes the goon kidnaps him br br when steve finally meets up with anna at the house we wonder how anna got her hands on the cash did she somehow steal it from dundee after the heist when he went out to dinner it's never explained even worse anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of the blue before her selfishness and attraction to dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection at the hands of steve and threats but after going back to steve because she fears dundee she inexplicably turns on him when he is most vulnerable just as there is you have femme fatale' br br in film encyclopedic reference to the american style by silver and ward the authors hail by as one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir i beg to differ in order to have tragedy you need characters that have great depth and in order to be compelling you need a story that's plausible criss cross has neither it's an overrated b movie that somehow has found itself in the pantheon of art house noirs once again the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating the pictures of yesteryear
<START> this is just dreadful i regret every second of the 80 minutes i spent watching this dreck i think it's supposed to be a comedy but i don't remember laughing much except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors br br an unattractive middle aged man called lester meets up with rich unattractive middle aged women via lonely hearts ads and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction that's the whole plot and that's really all that happens along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret but its so badly implemented you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening the sequences in which lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies one sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven it's very cruelly depicted but it is played out against blaring big band waltz music with lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs you have to see this to believe it actually you don't have to see it at all in fact i strongly recommend you avoid this flop fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career one sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched the revelation when lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen so from this point on he just films the actor as normal shadow and all and thus totally blows the whole angle either he had zero budget for effects or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it whatever it was that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is i couldn't even understand most of the film and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time even the ending was as flat as a pancake a real dud
<START> johnnie bert wheeler is a would be songwriter newton robert woolsey is a would be inventor both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building johnnie wants to sell a song to winfield lake a song publisher who also owns the building lake's secretary mary betty grable is sweetheart when lake turns up dead circumstances conspire to make mary and newton think that johnnie is the killer they conspire again to implicate mary who goes to jail but who really shot lake who is the black widow the blackmailer who had threatened him the other characters in this wacky murder mystery are lake's suspicious wife a self satisfied private detective a seemingly slow witted janitor willie best lake's auditor a songwriter who thinks lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him it's up to newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer br br the baby voiced wheeler and the cigar chomping woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny br br not this one george stevens who went on to have a distinguished career directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot but two scenes are good and both feature wheeler and betty grable singing the excellent music in my heart written by dorothy fields and jimmy mchugh the first time they sing it walking up a staircase after which they dance back down later wheeler and woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to mary who is in a jail cell on a high floor wheeler and grable sing to each other through the bars br br the nitwits has a few laughs but the level of comedy is best illustrated by woolsey's line sonny you've got the brain of a six year old boy and i'll bet even he was glad to get rid of it it's watered down didn't use the superfluous even when he said it
<START> there wasn't a 0 in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figure br br it is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting and an awful script br br this movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of hitch salman khan with his usual take off you shirt theme and govinda with his in humorous laughs if somebody had told 2 decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman after his success with maine pyar kiya i would have written him her off
<START> r 64 br br unredeemable merit less and above all dreary trash you know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is lance henriksen the french title for this movie says it all inexplicable how can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age whatever jonas trick is it worked this is Ã¼ber trash i'm talking 'manos' level crap meaningless unwatchable not even so bad it's good cinematic bile of the highest order br br lance henriksen is harlan knowles a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality he along with a bunch of morons goes on a field trip to search for an evil sasquatch which is believed to have attacked a plane which crashed out in the woods or something not much else happens there's some soft core meaning level nudity and some blatant rip offs of predator after 92 minutes of utter pain and another ripped off scene this time from blair witch the movie finally staggers across the finish line and ends as a bonus we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie br br there's really not much to say about this film all you need to know is this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a so bad it's good flick the untold is to entertainment value what orlando bloom is to character acting avoid it like arsenic
<START> solange is not a great italian thriller get ready for the spoiler the main suspect the professor didn't do it but is it really a spoiler no because you know that he couldn't have been the murderer from the very beginning he and a student witnessed the first murder so there is absolutely no suspense as to whether or not the professor is the killer there is a long tedious build up to the final explanation of the mystery the solution is interesting but it comes out of nowhere the rest of the movie and it's not a short movie is just not exciting enough to hold your interest even in the tradition of wrong man accused it fails because the police never seriously accuse the professor and the killer is never after him dull dull dull
<START> i haven't watched this show in months but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it so maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time although the commercials and the 4 2 rating on imdb aren't a good sign br br it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelle's show even mencia says so and while i wasn't even that big a fan of chappelle's show his jokes were at least original and clever and far edgier than mencia has ever been mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale if you can't see that i guess there's just no hope for you but to be fair here are some examples br br mencia blatantly rips off lil jon skit just takes it br br south park makes an episode about scientology one week later mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists bear in mind the joke isn't about scientologists but about how much he's offended them on his show when up to this point he has never made a single scientology joke ever br br after hurricane katrina two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man looting groceries and a white woman finding them weeks later after millions of people have already seen this mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time the daily show would have been on something like that in a day pathetic br br even more annoying than the joke stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show claiming he's breaking down some sort of pc barrier whatever and that if you aren't laughing you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race yes carlos it's not because you're not funny it's because we're all too offended to laugh if that was really true then why was chappelle's show so popular he constantly berates his audience for not getting it if he doesn't get enough laughs and often repeats and explains his jokes a technique most comedians stop using by age 14 br br the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent it's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central which is baffling again it has a 4 2 rating on this site where the hell are they getting these numbers comedy central tries to bill itself as an edgy station but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible that will never be the case

<START> very violent and nicely filmed movie is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too this movie has lots of black humor this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster there will be sometimes when you wouldn't know whether to shiver or to smile and think am i laughing at someone who is killing people
<START> it is extremely rare that i see a movie from 1955 that i don't love noir sci fi drive ins i dig it all the most robert aldrich is a director who has done plenty of excellent work and most of this cast has fine performances under their belt so what went wrong br br when i used to work in the independent film world we used to talk about something called actors' movies actors' movies are movies that are unwatchable to anyone but other actors actors like actors' movies because they get to see acting which is to say completely over the top melodrama actors love to be given the chance to totally let loose give it all they've got and they get a great satisfaction from watching other actors do so in many interviews with actors they say he was a great director he never interfered with me in any way actually that's the opposite of good directing because the whole point of having a director on the set is to keep the actors from making fools of themselves which given the chance they will always do br br apparently robert aldrich forgot that on this project or maybe he was ill or maybe he thought there was no hope for saving the script in the first place so what the heck whatever the case here is an example of a lesser known movie that is best forgotten the characters pontificate and generally ham it up all the way through one thing i can say is realistic it's set in hollywood and everyone acts like their petty problems are the most important thing in the world doesn't make it fun to watch but it is realistic what isn't realistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract is going to go out of his way to him in almost every conceivable way including requiring him to engage in illegal activity but this and other plot contradictions merely carry along the melodrama increasing the opportunity for hand wringing and shouted accusations br br i did manage to get to the end of this film which makes it no worse than a 3 out of 10 in my book but why test your own endurance when there is so much else available to rent
<START> this sequel to in the heat of the night will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its infinitely better predecessor instead of looking like a theatrical movie edited for television mister looks suspiciously like a tv movie edited for theatrical release with grainy photography cheesy opening titles and sets that look like they're made of plywood the murder sequence has a glaring continuity error the camera shows two hands choking the girl then a shot of a hand reaching for a statuette then a shot of the girl being choked with two hands again and finally the statuette coming down for the fatal blow solving the case should be easy find the only guy with three hands but the shoddy production values can't completely obscure this film's considerable merits namely sidney poitier's performance as the cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it may lead even if it implicates a friend martin landau is also convincing as the do gooder preacher activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend in addition to being haunted by the case is conflicted about his home life but the issues of race and barely concealed sense of social outrage are absent here so is the complex murder mystery that made in the heat of the night so compelling
<START> this film is totally mindblowing it manages to be thought provoking funny tragic and cinematic yet claustrophobic br br although the flashbacks are unnecessary the film maintains a pacy punchy grip and the performances are all excellent in particular alec baldwin and the mesmerising eric bogosian as the film's anti hero barry
<START> the quintessential let's get ready for summer movie it's dumb goofy and maybe a touch dated but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it in the style of all little guys versus the establishment movies so yes the plot is very predictable but it's warm and funny and no it's not bill murray at his bill but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role odd though to see how few of the fresh young faces in this film went on to do much more
<START> the black castle is one of those film's that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an outright horror movie whilst some horror elements exist within nathan movie this really is a multi genre piece that's tightly produced and effectively portrayed joining karloff in what is a small but critical role are richard greene stephen mcnally lon chaney jr rita john hoyt michael pate it's produced unsurprisingly out of universal international pictures the plot sees greene's english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno mcnally he's following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every turn br br this has everything that fans of the old dark house castle sub genre could wish for genuine good and bad guys a fair maiden dark corners for doing dark deeds devilish traps ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain the cast are all turning in effective performances particularly greene and the wonderfully sneering mcnally whilst jerry writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar film's of this ilk a very recommended film on that karloff fans understand it's not really a karloff movie and perhaps more importantly that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout the black castle is a fine viewing experience 7 10
<START> i am very thankful that the small college town of va near bristol tn and home of the famous barter theatre where gregory peck once acted managed to get an art film festival and show this film there is two and a hour hours from where i live but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word distant is an amazing brilliant jarring emotional captivating film as a turkish american this film was not only a testimony as to what life in turkey is like but on a larger scale it tells the world of what it is like to be turkish whether one lives in istanbul berlin montreal new york or omaha it may be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes but this is effectively our bob marley song there are so many wonderful scenes in this film it is very difficult to choose just a random few but for me one telling scene takes place in a downtown istanbul cinema the title character played by mehmet who sadly died in a car accident shortly after this film's completion follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the cinema's main auditorium she goes into see vanilla sky as the image of tom cruise is reflected from a glass we sense that turkish men are competing with tom cruise for their own women's affections even though tom cruise is nowhere to found in the scenes shot across the shores are also quite revealing as they symbolize the beauty yet desperate empty which are a painful fact of life in turkey in this film the gulf separates lovers and families a simple empty packet of turkish brand cigarettes and a dying mouse jump off the screen the way seagulls did in the 1982 goren yilmaz film many of films including the herd 1978 completed by and baba the father 1971 have been considered by many to be the best turkish films ever made without sometimes overblown social political anger especially in his last film the 1983 prison drama the wall distance captures the essence of turkish life quite remarkably this is a crowning achievement for a director who in my view can already be proclaimed as the turkish equivalent to directors like tarkovsky bresson and ozu i can't wait to see his other films
