<START> this film is just as bad as the birdman of alcatraz i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like alan alda and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject a societal outcast br br i was in junior high school during the last years of life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and was the victim br br get a grip people read the history was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest then abducted and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliation br br got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here
<START> several get on a russian ship bound for france they were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves after being discovered by the first mate and his henchmen they were held captive then things got very bad for them good show based on a true story
<START> this film is exceptional in that marlene raymond present outstanding performances the acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production but the script direction and editing deserve applause there is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars if you like marlene and you like raymond you'll love this film it's a classic that compares with casablanca br br
<START> wow br br reading through these comments i see a remarkable socio cultural clash theme emerging between the us and the dutch the us p o v appears to be that this is quite a good little movie parker being a likable hero the story a light hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality br br all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster br br far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically still based on factual observation i saw the movie with my very own eyes i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark br br parker kane is poorly made utterly boring and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation
<START> this was the one movie to see about the war my aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the justin and madeline wedding scene and my uncle was an extra on a horse the script was genuine and accurate the costumes were tastefully done the was in order and even the accents were good i dearly love patrick swayze and james they were the best 2 choices and it even had a great supporting cast the civil war is my favorite thing in american history and i love movies about it i have seen quite a few and this movie and it's sequal north and south book 2 took the cake if you haven't seen it rent it as soon as possible it's quite an
<START> i don't understand this movies distinctly average rating br br i really really enjoyed it i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t v br br there are three excellent characters here excellent characters danny devito played a gem quite a feat considering he was directing as well his down trodden laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way there are people like that owen was just on the line without crossing it br br billy crystal's comic and sense of timing was perfect for his role his frustration comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more you could understand his feelings to really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here thrice over br br thirdly who else could have played momma there is no one that can play this part so well there is a style there unlike any other something you love to watch i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen and not because the rest was bad oh no but because momma's character was again so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch br br and what's more a happy ending with new found friendships no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life without a big hunk of cheese tied on the end br br brilliant script brilliant idea perfect cast great film
<START> even from the very commencing title of this movie i really love the artwork and canvas layout of one of the national islands of japan we see some great rolling green hills and some oriental houses of a coastal town instantly we are looking at the pacific beauty on the widescreen of the theater and to prove how great this film is i have to say that charles darwin would be proud teachers of evolution classes and school sciences such as biology would fantastically favor hayao miyazaki's brand new movie entitled the title character as you will see may be the perfect animation icon of media to be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums alike br br besides the scientific aspect of all this let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story we have a skinny old and powerful sorcerer named fujimoto who lives in a and is cynical of the urban expansion of mankind and their pollution of industrial waste he wants to have complete control of the seas and the cute looking peaceful aquatic life including fish and organisms fujimoto whose blood is composed to be half human and half amphibious resembles both an ocean loving anti hero and antagonist similar to the james bond villain stromberg in the spy who loved me who operates an atlantis dubbed underwater city br br his daughter whom he treats like an over cared for pet is named she is a large goldfish who already looks like a pretty red haired girl the father bans her from the real human world claiming it to be dangerous and too much for her to handle but quite frankly exploratory curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature eventually with building strength similar to wonderful scenes from nick park's chicken run she breaks free of her father's rocky and fossilized aquatic city and swims to the water surface of japan and to her luck and joy falls into the caring hands of a youngster ship tanker captain named br br living in an ocean front house at a neat looking beach or boulder filled beach has two overworking parents a senior home working mother lisa and the first mate of a tanker barge koichi lisa seems to be angry at her spouse for being away on a ship and leaving her with all the housework even more so the black magic that is exerted by causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur the moon approaches the earth too closely and waves surge from the of the tidal interaction forces and humongous tsunami waves rack the peaceful but evacuated town however what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than supernatural might is the love and tightly embraced friendship between the childish captain and the adorable red headed who wants to be a sensitive human than just a preserved fish much like the haired and free spirited hobbits in the lord of the rings grants me a slight reminder of that br br i could write on and on about this amazing animated film the best since coraline which was in theaters in february and right now hayao miyazaki feast your eyes on another 10 star grade from your animation fan graham abraham the year 2009 may be filled with dozens of animated films however is the most towering film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world
<START> first off to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the b horror range what this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via nordic flavor at times reminding me of the humor of jackson's dead alive and others of a stuart gordon flick this little find should have most chuckling throughout br br the f x reach a few highs of truly spooky the first time ed meets his nemesis but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f x team that decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other films gremlins devils slasher films etc to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations br br the gem of the film is the humor the gore works most of the time but more for laughs at its heart its a parody and a fun one at that
<START> be prepared for the trip to haneke's la pianiste the psychological sickness of the main character wonderfully played by huppert goes beyond any limit you could expect the most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character erika trash sexuality no nudes scenes though perversion masochism incestuous relations haneke gives us a crude meal heavy to digest sometimes the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it the mise en is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie it has obvious austro germanic sometimes scandinavian notes static long scenes but never boring the vienna settings the french language used make the whole look like a european blend the permanent germanic music background schubert is beautifully chosen above all both of the cannes awards for best actors are well deserved one of the greatest performance of the year by one of the greatest french actress ever
<START> this film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life it made me think of other movies like the song of bernadette and francis of and has a very strong catholic faith influence in the film ann blyth is very charming as first the catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of saint anne which is the name of the street that i live on by the way and makes many prayers for the whenever problems come up in her life frances aunt bea from the andy griffith show and edmund gwenn from miracle on 34th street play relatives of her a local priest of mine used to say that my sister resembled ann blyth and the both of them have the same first and middle names a nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler
<START> spoiler alert it just gets to me the nerve some people have to remake and i use the term loosely here good movies in the american version of this dutch thriller someone decided the original ending wasn't enough for american audiences so what do they do they create a new one a stupid improbable i pretend i'm dead but come to life again so the good guy can kick my butt some more kind of ending do yourself a favor and get the original one
<START> i served as a at parris island in the late 60's a little over 10 years after the d i was shot i was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the indoor scenes i knew a lot of drill instructors and a lot of recruits i think the movie is as close as any movie to showing the life of a recruit and that of a drill instructor without a doubt i think it is the best thing jack webb ever did if you have been in the military you need to see this movie this was the way it was it shows how important it is to take a bunch of raw recruits and turn them into men ready to defend our country one feature i found fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real marines not actors
<START> bad editing bad production values bad continuity implausible bad dialogue this movies is bad bad bad however if you want a movie to poke fun at a la mst3000 this is your movie i wouldn't suggest spending much money on it but if you do see this movie make sure it's with plenty of witty like minded buddies
<START> if this film doesn't at least be selected for an oscar nominee for best foreign film i'm going to stop waking at nights watching the event fridrik thor fridriksson has proven that money isn't the key to making a good movie but originality out of a cold country comes a warm but thought provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world after an insight like this you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in
<START> there's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee the bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for 22 closeup of tag later mary astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom proof that bimbo slept with him still later mary astor is about to have an affair with ricardo cortez looks at the price tag of her silk negligee 14 and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo as well as the fact that she's spent 8 less than the most obvious woman she's ever met it sounds an obvious morality turn but it was well done the film would be stronger if robert character had been played by a more powerful actor he's too low key for a self made salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera and if ricardo cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically both male leads are bland and forgettable and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this film's era however the mary astor character is interesting appealing and believable behind closed doors is well worth seeing
