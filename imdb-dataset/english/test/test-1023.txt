<START> okay i'll admit right up front that the cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market seen today the huge lipped and very stereotypical is not politically correct however the cartoons were well made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd in other words throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history plus little black and other racist cartoons are out there especially on the internet br br this cartoon has our little hero out hunting at first he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion a lion that is more than happy to make his dinner however through all this a weird appears again and again and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story br br cute well made and clever i like the cartoons plus i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks loads of fun folks
<START> the other boleyn girl not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon this movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation i could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things the book is not perfection but it was well written and became very popular i could understand if the bbc wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened who anne boleyn really was but it's not even close to being historically accurate either it's just fluff mindless made up fluff a real shame br br to begin with the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality tv show seriously they have the sitting in front of the camera confessing how they really feel about what's happening in their lives anne boleyn sits in a confessional not the church kind the real world kind and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about she looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the 1500s it's the real world tudor england br br may is a very good actress and after 'the and 'a turn of the i was becoming a real fan of hers but she should never have been cast as anne actually i think she would have been a better mary natascha mcelhone was a poor choice she's a good actress sure but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume honestly i spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was that girl from 'the truman show ' she was she's also too old to play the teen aged mary so for some unknown reason they made mary the oldest of the sisters it makes no sense i know it's like the bbc seemed to forget that these people actually lived they're twisting the story around and making things up left and right i feel ridiculous having to correct the bbc on historical inaccuracies but really br br apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen steven mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for george and his casting was the real reason i decided to seek out this movie big mistake he does a great job sure but he's hardly in this how can anyone pretend they're adapting the other boleyn girl and hardly mention george boleyn that's just absurd philip was another very good casting decision but yet again was hardly in the finished product br br the real problem with this is the script there's just no getting around that it's bad it's really really bad it's too melodramatic and not engaging anne is portrayed as an air head mary as the ringleader and george as the follower mary's first husband is hardly mentioned her relationship with the king is never explained they simply do not tell the story gregory wrote the whole thing comes across as a great big waste i have no desire to see this thing a second time i guess i'll just have to read the book again and hope that the natalie portman version due out next year will be much better br br note as of this writing the only way of obtaining this miniseries in the usa is on the last disc of the miniseries 'the six wives of henry viii ' that's a great miniseries but can cost 50 to 60 and that's way to much to spend if you're just looking for this piece of garbage
<START> a good cast a good idea but turns out it is flawed as hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in courts so many good actors and they are all acting so badly so why did they all get attracted to this mess and yes it has its good points such as lighting etc but ultimately i wondered two things how could so much talent lead to such a bizarre mess what is that accent that nigel hawthorne is putting on he is was a great actor and so what is that accent all about it is impossible to identify what was he trying to do maybe it is his subtle indication as if to say to us 'i've got involved with a turkey so here's a crap accent to go with it '
<START> riccardo may have a good reputation but since we now that many of his best films were in fact directed by the late great mario bava it's clear that he wasn't one of italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot it's a sprawling mess and overall i'd even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than insipid giallo effort the iguana with the tongue of fire apparently disowned this movie and i certainly don't blame him the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere they happen upon a house while searching for fuel but it turns out to be a bad choice as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony ho hum the film features a lead role for camille keaton who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers the film features one decent gore scene towards the end but this really isn't enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that don't make sense but even i couldn't stand this one miss it miss nothing
<START> perhaps not miyazaki's best work but i couldn't help but love it to death a five year old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle he saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet but it really is a magical being the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess as the boy names her is taken back to the sea by her father who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do the story is simple and cute where the film really comes alive though is in its tremendous artwork the drawings are more child like than in any of miyazaki's other works but there's beauty in its simplicity as with all of his films miyazaki creates this world of imagination that i was just so in awe of seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of jo hisaishi's score for princess mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago the score here is equally as wonderful i wanted to live in this world and never leave it
<START> opera opens with a very close up shot of a bird's ever watching eye and thus begins one of argento's most bizarre and enjoyable features my second favorite in fact behind deep red granted at times the movie is pretty absurd the lack of real concern after murders the bird attack the burnt dummy that endingÂ but this is argento's fantastical world and once you come to terms with that you'll find that it works i do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them for example the aforementioned bird attack is completely over the top in theory yet look at the wonderful execution of it crows flying in chaos adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat the crowd in panic as seen through the circling bird's eye view camera work and then the focused attack aria of terror indeed argento's amazing flowing cinematography is on full display in opera and clearly one of the film's highlights i also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music a nice contrast of music with each used effectively the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel the sound effects deserve a nod too stabs scissors and all br br inspector alan santini i've seen a lot of your movies yes you're really an expert in this field i'd be very interested to know your opinion br br marco i think it's unwise to use movies as a guide for reality don't you inspector br br inspector alan santini depends what you mean by reality br br being that this is a giallo stylish murders are a must and dario does not disappoint the bullet through the door scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot if you'll forgive the pun the black gloved deep voiced pulsating brained cool shots killer is cold and brutal and having him tape pins under our heroine's eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch that all said as a giallo opera doesn't quite have as good of a mystery as it should the killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there's little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders this and the strange ending could've used more work despite these problems though opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film br br one final note it was nice to see a movie for once show the correct view through binoculars just a circle not two circles together nice eye for detail dario
<START> while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammer obvious satire 'homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit 9 11 before the 2004 elections and the real tragedy of dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the further in 2006 mockery of the well settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or as it did then br br frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence br br and if you didn't notice michael moore didn't exactly help to defeat bush br br there was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies
<START> this is in simple terms one of the worst films ever made the story goes way beyond being tasteless and judging by the actors performance they know it there just in not one single quality of this film patrick swayze will have to overcome some major obstacles in his career before people forget about this turkey
<START> i can understand how barney can be annoying to some but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isn't bad especially for the young ones he entertains i personally find this show to be very underrated period barney friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut and nearly 21 years after the character's debut on home video he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children maybe less so than in the early 90's where barney was the hannah montana of the time but he's still a classic as a fan of barney myself i feel that i should defend him in a way that doesn't seem like spam the way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic but would you rather have them hearing about war be thankful some one a costumed dinosaur but still is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply in this day and age i feel that we rush our kids to grow up and barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart in addition many of barney's lessons on current episodes about plagiarism being honest and yes even death could appeal to everyone not just his target audience besides our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are and he helps them do that in short barney may be annoying to some people and i completely understand why but cut him some slack all he and his friends along with hit entertainment his production company are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life if more people listened to their children's favorite character and viewed him through their eyes maybe we wouldn't be so negative about him and possibly life itself
<START> when i was young i'd get up early every saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called 'kung fu theatre ' it wasn't as if these films were works of art it wasn't as if these films all came from china japan korea or any country in particular if the story had to do with fighting Â be it swordplay or fisticuffs Â and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any american gym class then that was good enough it wasn't as if they were really even very good they were just great action flicks with incredibly over dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys and then the credits would roll br br sword in the moon is much like these films of my youth arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good br br yun cho hyun is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher ' he kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the chun dynasty the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service however an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers and yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them his task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are choi a friend from his past and his former love shi br br sadly sword doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended while the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood the tone is almost sacrificed to the never ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc what should've been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage and the film suffers as a result br br i've read that this film marks korea's first real foray into the world of art house action pieces along the likes of crouching tiger hidden dragon next time i'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more and a little less 'art '
<START> i could not stand the woman who played the mother i wanted her to shut up she had a bizarre manner of speaking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better i had no idea why the men of the town were so taken with her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty even after a terrible tragedy her voice was devoid of human emotion she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life she delivered her lines with the same emotion whether she was saying i love you i hate you the bank is my dress is on fire was this actually filmed in ireland the sun blazed throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest i lived in ireland during the summer of 2002 the summer in a century most everything was still harvested if the farmers in ireland could only harvest during long dry stretches then the country would have starved hundreds of years ago it seems as if there wasn't a lot of money to make the movie the black and white flashbacks looked as if they were filmed with the security cameras one can get at sam's club
<START> i always knew the day was coming we all knew there's only so much oil in the ground and one day we'll run short but isn't there supposed to be enough coal to use instead and wind power or something things for future generations to worry about br br then this documentary hit me smack between the eyes oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms when the inevitable oil shortages hit a lot of things air travel many drugs plastics life in the suburbs will become impossible but the craziest insight from the documentary is this oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our lives must change even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange post oil world which the documentary claims could be starting now br br despite its gloomy message the documentary is often highly entertaining it contains fabulous historical footage sober images of dark urban factories and campy funny stuff from the 1950's which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place it also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place br br my only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now how can this be a big emergency all of a sudden we knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post oil world and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars if our failure to follow through on president jimmy carter's 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a post oil world why was no one shouting about it on br br in the end i found the documentary highly persuasive and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream this is must viewing for everyone not afraid to face a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about br br charles
<START> i seemed to find the trailers better than the movie they did their job and made me interested in watching unknown the interest waned early a simple premise in scenery five men wake up in a chemical warehouse not knowing why they are there let alone know how in the hell they got there confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and distrust the men learn that a kidnapper is on his way with plans to kill his hostages now the men size each other up trying to distinguish if all are victims and who may actually be one of the kidnappers the cast includes jim caviezel greg kinnear joe pantoliano bridget moynahan barry david selby and adam rodriguez
<START> without doubt grand champion has the most impressive cast of aaa level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun g rated family adventure this is a must buy for every video collection director barry skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo 4h competition for the grand champion cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges joey lauren adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well intentioned mother but the star of the show is 12 year old emma roberts whose on camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt julia you can expect a lot from this young roberts as is already proving itself in her new hit nickelodeon series
<START> andy milligan the independent movie maker from new york directs this little treat as his version of the sweeney todd legend sweeney slits the throats of customers in his barbershop and his cohort mrs lovett turns them into meat pies thankfuly i was well informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty milligan for my money has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all time race ed wood looks like orson welles in comparison this movie is so bad in oh so many ways let's take milligan's direction for starters the film quality is grainy the sound quality is grainy many scenes look as if milligan was using a camcorder to film the credits say photograped and directed by andy milligan he wants to take credit for ceilings showing up after a death scene how about the atrocious musical score selected for the film the film cuts with one poor transition after another little logic is used in the creation of the plot the story has little to do with the actual legend of todd the murder scenes are plentiful but not horrifying in any way hands legs and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done choppily and let's take the breast in the pie scene yes it is in there the pie maker didn't know that an entire breast with nipple filled an entire pie crust later we hear from our characters that they have been careful not to get caught for the 200 plus murders they have done obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep abreast of what is going on sorry it was too tempting the actors are not too terribly bad to be honest some even have glimmers of talent and all seem to be genuine english articles many non erotic nude scenes are forced throughout milligan seemingly has some issues regarding sex plot strands are left untied the ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work i could go on and on did i like anything about the film not much to be truthful i have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick
