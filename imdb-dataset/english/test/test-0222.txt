<START> ok i gave it a 3 just because they obviously had no money to make this film but i feel it might deserve the 2 3 rating it had when i got here i'm actually helping to raise it's rating despite being bored for the last hour and a half i will save the 1's and the 2's for the higher budget pieces of crap at least the makers of rise of the undead didn't waste that much money they did manage to waste 90 minutes of my life br br the movie is too claustrophobic for me the entire movie takes place in the same building in dark rooms and hallways with a setting like this there should have been more action or character development but there is just a lot of meaningless talk i didn't get to know any of the characters there is a schoolgirl and a goth chick but we never find out much more about them none of the characters seem really likable br br terrible movie made on zero budget no scary special effects no suspense really nothing interesting at all here folks i admit i downloaded this from the net it was free but i am throwing it away br br sorry to the filmmakers better luck next time this one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie
<START> spoilers when i first saw the preview for this it looked like a good old fashioned hallmark movie i love bluegrass music so i couldn't wait to see it when we rented the movie we read the back and it sounded even better the film was pretty boring for the first half every now and then a song would be played then i'm embarrassed typing this a lesbian love seen came in i that ther was something more then friendship between the teachers but i certainly didn't expect nudity and prolonged make out sessions i was watching this with my mother and i was quite embarrassed because i picked this movie but besides that it was an okay movie the acting was fine the actress who played was great to be honest the soundtrack was the best part of the movie i don't care to see the movie again but i bought the soundtrack the day after i saw the movie and there are continuation discs that follow if i were you i would skip the movie and just get the music
<START> my mistake for thinking this was a serious war is hell movie prior to seeing it that all ended seconds into the film when the mtv logo appeared it might as well been called national lampoon's sexy n loose and it did play to the mtv crowd the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40 years ago at least disney was smart enough to ship its rated r stuff over to and allowed us to take it seriously okay i'm being harsh it wasn't that bad of a film however it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased one sided admittedly i'm not a war movie buff i can't watch ' 'full metal jacket' or 'saving private ryan' more than once sure they were good movies but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where i wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next following a tour in iraq phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract or at least that's the military's plan until he goes awol and the characters speed cross country on a few bucks amazingly never caught no i haven't been in any war nor to iraq nor do i agree with it i also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts i can say this though i am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict i can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print it's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the surgeon general's warning on their box of cigarettes and say oh they're what deadly i'll sue them
<START> i will freely admit that i haven't seen the original movie but i've read the play so i've some background with the original if you off the fact that this is a remake of an old classic this movie is smart witty fresh and hilarious yes the casting decisions may seem strange but they work br br i'm a staunch feminist and i wasn't offended in the slightest by this movie despite what other women might be saying this is not a movie for men to see so please ladies don't drag your guys to see it with you that's just cruel women will get the jokes the situations and the relationships br br i was pleasantly surprised by the depth that annette bening brought to her character she did an excellent job debra messing was adorable and candice bergen was fantastic i was less impressed by meg ryan she brought emotion to the table but her comedic take on it was less strong the all female cast is strong and it definitely a laugh out loud sort of comedy i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and fully intend to go see it again with my mother women will understand
<START> going to need to take a deep breath for this one br br terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci fi movies like pitch black terrible acting endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns a cargo ship staffed by a camouflage wearing crew of gun toting soldiers why exactly would you need forest camouflage in space anyway some of the worst casting choices in the history of no budget film making a steroid swollen captain who comes across more like a muscle beach jock than a trustworthy commander and a convict who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit 70 minutes in length 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of compression of time through editing br br i won't go on suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can and should be forgiven due to it's low budget the bad conception laughable plot holes and snore inducing script are unforgivable on any budget the end result is a tedious dull waste of time sorry guys i hate to be so harsh on an amateur film but you've no excuse for turning out this kind of work
<START> after watching the movie a few times i found so many subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue jing ke the assassin has become one of favorite movie characters of all time this fine chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements then any big screen american actor today the emperor is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart only to unleash the most cruel acts upon the people around him the promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist gong li as in just about every movie i've ever seen her in is simply fantastic her screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged br br in case you couldn't tell i loved this movie br br
<START> david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life this time the creatures under the sea in this extraordinary 8 episode trip to all the animals under the sea br br the cinematography is astounding bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales but the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it whether it is making models of creatures or those impressive shots of the whales they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it br br 2001 had some great tv shows to our screen but in contrast to this documentary gem they make them pretty lame but to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment br br overall this is the best tv series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best tv series of 2000s
<START> i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves just view those votes not top class action like die hard or lethal weapon but still something like a solid 7 out of 10 fine script good actors with working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants sadly this was director harlin's last good film deep blue sea managed to reach 'an ok rollercoaster status but cutthroat island and especially driven are well deserved flops personally i think the turn off at the box office might have been the woman as an action star theme well give her a chance because davis does deliver a performance above par and after all this film doesn't concentrate so much on the feminine side but instead on good ol' action jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here plus his share of action and about a thousand killer wisecracks and on the plot from shane black the writer of lethal weapon and the last boy scout the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one the theme the clever plot also as good and as underrated overall if one hasn't seen this one yet don't forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night
<START> i am an addict of the tv show the live shows and everything they do and this was the last piece of work they have done on tv film as 'the league of gentlemen' br br if you love the series then you will absolutely love the film it is a nice ending to their tv series br br it is clever and funny br br although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers a must see for any league of gentlemen fan br br watch it
<START> this appears to be one of noel coward's lesser known films and it is easy to understand why taken at face value it's not a bad film but there's nothing terribly good about it either nothing much happens at all throughout the course of the film it's simply the story of chris and leonora's ill fated affair and barbara's reaction to it the only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know it's going to end badly for one reason or another owing to the first scene oddly there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict and yet none of them are utilised for example it would've been much more interesting and believable if barbara fallen out with leonora but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film the notion of barbara having been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all in fact she didn't even seem to feel betrayed by her husband she even encourages him to go on a holiday with leonora similarly chris' two secretaries at his practice susan birch and tim who also happen to be close friends of both chris and barbara are never forced to take sides in fact tim shies away from conflict by telling chris that he's terribly fond of both him and barbara despite the strange lack of conflict the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we don't care whether chris ends up with leonora or barbara the two womens' personalities are indistinguishable anyway so we don't know which of the two is better suited to be with chris and besides this barbara's gives the impression that she hardly cares about the affair anyway furthermore i found chris and leonora's relationship somewhat unconvincing i can overlook the ridiculously short timeframe in which they fall for each other because that is so common in films of this era but even then the relationship seemed shallow coward's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of leonora's affections he reminds me of the socially inept genius sir earnest from the film very important person i'm sure the two would've gotten along well chris' coldness and austerity made his love for leonora seem insincere i think coward should've sat this one out and given his part to a younger man as it is i was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a sombre mostly emotionless balding middle aged man despite all my criticisms the film still manages to be interesting just not terribly compelling the fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature which is somewhat intriguing the astonished heart is certainly worth watching but it is a flawed piece of cinema
<START> how did this film get into the berlin film festival i understand it got into the panorama section but still br br this film featured br br 1 no plot 2 horrible acting 3 atrocious 4 some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video br br the one clincher that accounts for most of its festival is the presence of that old standby homosexuality that's right about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off then he feels weird about it and they have a boring old breaking up conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in middle school featuring lines like you kissed me first dude oh and by the way this is no crying game you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the film aside from that it's mostly just bad tags badly costumed undercover cops some skateboarding and a train ride br br if the subject matter is of interest to anyone i recommend looking around the web for some underground graff videos taken by real graffiti artists there's plenty out there and they are a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap
<START> i like underground films when they have something to say or show for that matter i tried hard to like trash i tried to see some artistic achievement or some interesting representation of new york city life in the early 70's or at least being entertained by it but the movie stinks and can't be called either art or entertainment br br trash is basically an excuse to expose joe nude body for 2 hours while he meets other uninteresting annoying figures i agree that's a gorgeous body but no excuse for a whole movie about it right holly as joe's girlfriend provides a few good laughs by the end but then it's too late to save those wasted couple of hours lou reed's classic song walk on the wild side is a better portrayal of those people and that time even if it's more fascinating than they actually were 1 5 10
<START> this is one of the worst films i've seen for years the storyline has potential that is never realized the actors are a poor choice but considering the screen writing their talent isn't wasted i really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so i could get out and watch something else unfortunately i did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmurs of people moaning about how crappy this is there wasn't booing after all this is england just gentle moans about how crap that was then i look on imdb and see people have given it 10 out of 10 i really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score they must be a pr company working with the distributor there's a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film when in the graveyard and the hick attacks look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched supposed to be a brick wall the blood effects are waaaay ott the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the director
<START> we went to the cinema expecting a budget release and got an art house movie the movie was projected digitally onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with edges classic of digital projection and had a limited stereo soundtrack which was wasted on the cinema experience br br the content of the film was the same old historical content we have all seen before but heavily sanitized to prevent the audience being sick live action scenes what little of them there were were re used constantly in classic documentary style which became annoying after a while br br i was somewhat amazed that only 4 people turned up to watch it guess the rest knew something we didn't br br i suspect the producers made the film to recognize the anniversary of gallipoli i have to question whether they should have bothered br br seven out of ten for trying and out of respect for the
<START> i guess if you like watching dudes get pumped up to outrageous sizes this is right up your alley otherwise it's an exercise in ego i don't need to do either anyhoo it's of historic interest i guess to see how these muscle positive and brain negative chumps got that way before after and in between steroids but otherwise this isn't going to influence many guys and as for women well i'm not one so i can't say
