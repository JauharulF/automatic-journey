<START> i had to watch this movie with my 5 year old he didn't laugh once during the entire movie and he loves dogs and will laugh at nearly anything this movie was horrible from all aspects poor script even accounting for a children's g rated movie poor production the jittery camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes poor acting perhaps they were directed to act cartoonish and even poor sound quality there are parts where the audio level seems fine then you can't hear what the next actor is saying i'm willing to put up with quite a lot when it comes to watching a child's movie but this was worse than having a stick in my eye i also didn't like being battered over the head with the god heaven belief thing in all it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life and i've done some serious time wasting in my day
<START> i was disappointed with the recent 2000 american remake of this english mini series though it followed the plot line very closely it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original out not to mention adding shallow preachy heavy handed so my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick with the original it's much longer but gripping and totally well done interesting complex and textured without the preachy self righteousness and it's beautifully shot as well br br i find it galling that these heartless remakes of great overseas films get so much hollywood fanfare at the oscars though i did like benicio del getting some deserved praise
<START> flowers if it's one thing you'll take away from this movie it's gonna be the flowers they feature so prominently and are used as plot devices you'll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends br br set in amsterdam daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life one a professional hit man eking out a living the other an interpol agent featuring a pan asian cast korean hong kong and crew director andrew lau from hong kong writer from korea and a thai post production team i could imagine the headaches in coordination br br park yi jung woo sung is a hit man who found a soft spot for painter young played by the pretty jeon ji hyun it's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies where her clumsiness caught his attention however being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career he can only admire her from afar do little or perhaps big things for her in an anonymous fashion but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4 he becomes her guardian angel from afar shielding her and keeping her safe from harm br br young is in love with this mysterious stranger she is constantly waiting for him to appear but i really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost daisy delivery nonetheless she's terribly moved and touched by this sole act however as the stars would have it interpol detective jeong woo lee sung chances upon young at a town square during one of his undercover missions and he too is captivated by her in a similar fashion because of his profession he is doubtful if he should make the first move br br which is where the audience would find it frustrating the lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy then again it's the good guy park yi being infuriated by jeong woo's pursuit but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself and jeong woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly it's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up br br that aside it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued and it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers or their loved one but fret not action fans there are enough cat and mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of infernal affairs as well as ample gunfights although i felt the ending could have been scripted tighter br br what rocks is the clever editing telling the story in a non linear timeline no worries it ain't that bad you'll still be able to follow the narrative from the points of view of all the leads keeping you in suspense and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event which i thought was extremely well done br br it's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares with plenty of classical music to the soul as with romance movies all the leads are eye candy the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy faced argh ok lah at certain angles jeon ji hyun br br if you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action tension department then daisy would be your choice if you prefer a more conventional weepy then the other korean movie making its debut here at the same time you are my sunshine would be your alternative and yes i totally dig the ending scene which i thought only the koreans do it best kinda reminded me of the one
<START> i love the first and third but this one was an abomination it was almost as horrible as 'the never ending story 3' for the same reasons they took a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes farming villages witches supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid and thought it would be funny to mix in our materialistic pop culture world of rock roll sushi i think thats what it was and flashy sports cars these two worlds do not belong together i do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio i have a sense of humor but this is just stupid this is what hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas don't give up though the eye of is much much better that one i gave a 10 this one portal of time i give a 1 believe me i don't always give such extremely high or low ratings i just tend to comment only such movies
<START> this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad or both that it didn't matter as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule for those u s residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey it's like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey it isn't pretty for our european friends think of two great rival football soccer to us clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other ouch of c outdid themselves here br br une hommage du maurice rocket richard m richard
<START> compared to the acclaimed hollywood remake this film is less flashy but much stronger at providing an overall picture of the drug problem the remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads that of a farmer whose meager livelihood depends on drugs as a paying cash crop and whose increased involvement with the drug trade in an effort to better himself destroys himself and his family additionally the story of the daughter's addiction goes into the problems not only of withdrawal but the high likelihood of this original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to go into the issues more thoroughly and remains stronger meat on this controversial subject
<START> spoilers throughout br br not good the movie differed completely from the book not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good br br i guess demi moore was ok actually i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other however the big disappointment wasn't with ms moore br br why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart i'm referring to him as the millionaire because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version just another change br br people who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall he is also fascinating the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot it was almost like seeing a completely different movie br br i know many movies vary widely from the books but i also thought redford's character was a bit of a wimp this isn't redford's fault he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another clichÃ© love story involving 1 woman and 2 men that wasn't really the point of the book br br this could have been a lot better even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much but changing so much around definitely takes it for me a few points down
<START> this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions this is most certainly not it br br having said that the acting was great and locations authentic this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time instead it isn't even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all
<START> idiocracy is the latest film to come from mike office space judge and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity relatively speaking it is a story about joe bauer luke wilson who is quite literally the most average guy in existence joe and a prostitute named rita maya rudolph become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber they were to remain suspended for only one year but due to lack of oversight joe and rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future br br here's the scary part this film explains in a very realistic and plausible way how the entire population of became absolutely retarded with no natural predators the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest smartest and strongest people for progression of genes just the people who breed the most unfortunately those people happen to be welfare sucking trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits this abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now joe and rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet if it helps imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks jocks and seeing this nightmarish dystopia joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and rita can get back to when they came from and that's basically the whole plot br br but despite how one dimensional i may make it sound this movie is higher brow than you can fathom nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses warning signs if you will of modern day dumb permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in idiocracy the film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal i don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you but let's just say that it is pretty thorough i can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor but it odd as it may seem has a purpose to show how dumb and crass these people are br br this film unfortunately is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor office space no one will see it in theaters but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome funny movie when it comes out on video my only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here other than that good characters funny jokes and better than average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow br br final note if seeing our youth becoming gang wanna be's acting like redneck ghetto trash and being proud of it if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity for god sakes watch this movie
<START> you could see the final outcome from a mile away all the signs were there the prom the liquor the fast ride the distraction of the females a good commercial for usage and later model vehicles that sit the passengers further back from the windshield also the ending is rather anti climatic as the ford van barely suffers a across its nose after hitting a bridge at high speed highly unlikely more damage to the van would have made it a little more believable and why do these films always take place during after a prom is it a case of once you survive the prom you will be good for life more than anything else it shows the lack of policing the prom for liquor and not keeping tabs on the minors who are leaving the dance for a joyride
<START> the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty check on the dinosaurs keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this also keep in mind it's a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and doesn't like him but he's still like yeah okay that just defined the stupidity in this movie one melissa proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies i can go ride a mountain bike between them but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far there's no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him but they have to stick to the formula of course and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like one of the army guys in this one how low can your acting career go the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying studio 3 to get into the frame it's not even honest pulp it's all taken from carnosaur which even sucked all by itself and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie

<START> instead of writing a paragraph i'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time 1 it is a visual odyssey that could only be told on the big screen the special effects that won kubrick his only oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of jurassic park and t2 they allow kubrick to give an accurate or at least are the most accurate depiction of space travel to date the silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science but also adds to the mood of the film to be discussed in a later point with hal the fact that kubrick shot the moon scenes before the apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move many have said that upon its original release it was a favorite trip movie i can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time sorry phantom menace fans 2 kubrick's directing style is terrific as in all his films kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots his camera is not as mobile as other greats such as scorsese but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold faces are the key element of a kubrick film like classic movies such as m and touch of evil kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view point even he uses extreme close ups of hal's glowing red eye to show the coldness and determination of the villain i could go on but in summation kubrick is at the of his style 3 hal 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history i whole heartedly agree with the late gene opinion of hal 9000 most of this film takes place in space through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself a mood of isolation is created dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter with nowhere to escape combine this mood with the cold calculated actions of hal 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable i still although having see this film several times feel my chest tighten in a particular scene 4 the controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is i'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open ended kubrick has stated that he to make 2001 open for discussion he left its meaning in the hands of the viewer by respecting the audience's intelligence kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning not the end of a meaningful discussion on man's past present and future the beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space no other movie save the great citizen kane leaves itself open to discussion like 2001 it is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind instead of waiting in long lines for the phantom menace rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience
<START> i am not quite sure i agree with the director of this version of the scarlet pimpernel i imagined sir percy a very calm seemingly lazy aristocrat this particular sir percy appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and i did not appreciate the houdini james bond mission impossible style escapes that sir percy engineered either in the previous versions wit was the tool for escape not technology neither were the characters of marguerite and adequately portrayed there seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters br br i do not wish to assign any blame for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation had the director's interpretation coincided with mine perhaps i might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals br br i much preferred the version from 1982 anthony andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable calm fop so were jane seymour and ian mckellen in my opinion the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption i recommend sticking with the previous versions either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982 br br
<START> the script seems to have been wholesale ahem ahem cough cough borrowed from a certain other movie involving using a self propelled manned drilling machine scene by scene the two movies were almost identical just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit br br but other than that i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deep underground in the earth genre of movies it's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over this movie is almost bearable far better than supernova which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb dumb dumb that nothing could save it a note to movie makers employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with it would be a very small part of the movie budget but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science br br production values almost passable i've seen far worse in my time br br a new thought for disaster movies instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity stupidity caused disaster movies with glowing heartwarming endings sort of justify stupidity by stating no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity it can be fixed which is definitely not the case a self caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of don't be so damn stupid in the first place should you watch this movie if you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store sure why not but do avoid supernova as i can assure you that you're not that bored that definitely was not one of luke perry's better movies this one is better that's not saying much but it is better br br one dead hoof up for being a deep underground genre movie one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre
