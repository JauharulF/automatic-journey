<START> i was waiting for this movie for a time in the first day of the air in turkey i watched it it was totally a disappointment for me i was planning to watch a historical movie but the one in the screen was a fictional one first of all the main character of the movie han the great conquer was portrayed like a soft calm even a loser one you can not feel the power in the movie historically the war machine he created was conquered Â¾ even more of the world know in those years to do that first unite the asian tribes however in the movie this loser man is in one scene poor alone man and in second scene he is commanding armies war scenes were incredibly week in the final battle the mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy as a consequences me and my friends just laugh at that scenes mongol army means mongol archery horseman you can not see that in the movie another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie i do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed as a prophet we can say in the integrity of the movie it is acceptable however the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of khan after gave him a mission is really funny when the monk died in the desert wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent we are talking about the again we laughed there are a lot of more things to say but i don't feel that this movie has value to talk more
<START> this movie is total dumbness incarnate yet i've seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because despite its sheer dumbness it's very entertaining and it has one of my favorite hokey movie actors casper van dien who is here in his full hokey movie glory here casper van dien is fully casper van dien and ya gotta love him for it if he hadn't been in this movie it would have been totally unwatchable dreck or at least far than it already is br br the cough cough science used here makes absolutely no sense at all no one else in the world noticed that big asteroid approaching the earth besides that small group not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies for just such a thing an asteroid that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight and a chunk of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it a rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous shockwaves that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the planet's surface surely someone would have noticed such a thing the science used in this movie is so completely ridiculous that somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it is br br one thing i noticed is that despite the uber heat all the characters weren't dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked with it at the most the characters looked like they had been lightly on occasion by someone off camera with a water bottle to give a sweat sheen authenticity was not a goal that this movie and constantly strived for which in a weird and hilarious sort of way gives this movie its entertainment charm br br is this movie actually worth watching definitely assuming of course you have absolutely no expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality and it's your desire to wallow and in total hokeyness at the moment
<START> here we have the inimitable charlie chaplin forsaking his slapstick past to tackle the serious subject of anti semitism and intolerance in general he portrays two characters the sweet innocent jewish barber a war veteran and the raving and ruthless dictator the jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long due to the whims of and his armed thugs who routinely rough up its residents or leave them alone dependent upon his mood that day or week the barber is among them but is befriended by his former commanding officer schultz reginald gardner who seems to keep things quiet for a while until condemns him to a concentration camp he seeks refuge with the jews in the ghetto most specifically the barber and the feisty young woman hannah goddard the premise will be who will be the one among these jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of and his cronies we needn't guess too hard to know the answer the barber is a dead ringer for the dictator and he is outfitted in his image accompanied by schultz also in full military gear hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of where mr maurice cousin has a farm and they can live for a while at this point himself has been arrested by his armed forces thinking him to be the notorious barber the latter meanwhile has been escorted with schultz to a podium to make a speech announcing the conquest of the ensuing ten minutes is pure chaplin himself speaking from his heart of tolerance love and freedom and denigrating greed and hatred albeit chaplin started production on the film in 1937 it can be forgiven some naivete he was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this persecution and hatred and said had he known the full extent he would never have made the film because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation he has a marvelous supporting cast reginald gardner henry daniell as his aide de camp the always wonderful billy gilbert as the bumbling herring goddard jack oakie as the dictator his rival for conquest veteran european actors david gorcey leo's father maurice among others the scene he choreographed with globe with just a musical accompaniment is sheer luminous inspiration and luminous as well is goddard at the film's end smiling through her tears i have seen this film before but there is always something new in it for me last evening when it finished i sat there in tears i defy anyone not to be moved by it
<START> steven seagal's films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since the patriot the plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who the film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making but seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame oh and i haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is even by seagal standards even as straight to video fodder this is not worth a view even for seagal fans give it a wide berth
<START> br br summary not worth the film br br as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family after coming to an arrangement with rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah eventually she accompanies her cousin a passionate leader of the brotherhood to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been scorned by rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of fenton until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision br br
<START> i am utterly astonished at how over rated cemetery man is among horror fans now i usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre styles into one and i love just about every zombie comedy i have ever seen to my dismay this italian cult classic really didn't show me a lot to get too pumped up about it follows the unusual duties of a full time cemetery care taker and his retarded man child curly joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death he meets a widow whom he wows with some grisly grave yard atmosphere and develops a quick romance soon having sex with her on her dead husband's grave the husband's corpse springs alive and bites her triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the movie cemetery man attempts to incorporate every element it can like horror romance comedy action and fails entirely in the long run it plods along never able to focus on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer such as the paunchy relationship with a living severed head a motorcycle riding zombie launching out of the ground the main character deciding to gun down random people on the sidewalk etc this thing is so convoluted and dull that it's nearly impossible to take it seriously sure it's stylish and often elegant but even the most artsy kind of films need the right kind of lineage to allow it to make sense cemetery man plods along appearing unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes which becomes very tiring after a while people argue that it's a more sophisticated zombie movie frankly when it comes to zombies i don't want anything more sophisticated than romero there's a little bit of gore and nudity mainly in the scenes where it wants to play horror movie but not nearly enough to make up for it's uncompromising lack of structure terrible film
<START> very good 1939 film where john garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder trouble is that the killer and garfield's girl ann sheridan in a brief but good performance get killed while trying to elude the police br br a crooked attorney persuades garfield to flee n y he lands in arizona and meets up with the dead end kids they've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble br br of course garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash br br may robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth claude rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in arizona br br the film really deals with garfield's relation to the boys while the ending is good you want to see garfield go back to n y to proclaim his innocence
<START> movies like these do not need sequels part of the advantage of don bluth moving away from disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight to video poorly animated cash in sequels but apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to all dogs go to heaven so we get this br br charlie sheen replaces burt and he's not really as good most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark different or entertaining as the original br br i feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap br br please no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em
<START> i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it i had seen it when i was younger and loved it after my second viewing i still loved it and i still do br br this is a love hate film if you like bottom young ones the comic strip then you will find this funny if you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother i love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it br br the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work br br yes the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film
<START> director and auteur jean pierre was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as france's third republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks it was a time he says when all the adults were a little bit insane he and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional the structure a classic farce is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical satisfying conclusion the peg for this plot is frederic played by brilliant newcomer gregory who is fully up to playing opposite adjani depardieu and ledoyen the real strength of the film is in its supporting performances m has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue though not yet as widely influential as renoir's of the game ' voyage' richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic though it demands a lot of the audience it gives much back one of its demands is tolerance for a certain and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching a crime melodrama no a spy thriller ah a romantic comedy recommend it to friends just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy
<START> in 1967 i saw an outstanding musical at the in new york city where angela lansbury lite the stage as mame but did hollywood give her the lead no lucille ball great as lucy was given the role she killed the film what a mistake there was no chemistry as there was on the stage bea arthur and angela what a twosome when they sang it is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today
<START> this is one of those religious horror films which never explain why the forces of evil are 10 000 times stronger than those of good we've got here a satanic cult which can 1 beam away people like in star trek 2 kill through little children's dolls 3 transfer a soul from one body into another 4 hypnotize telepathically from a bigger distance and 5 cause drastic car crashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others kids in this case survive unscathed br br on the other hand the forces of good can 1 sit around helplessly 2 stand around cluelessly 3 panic 4 laugh hysterically 5 waste time by doing nothing 6 read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens and 7 arrive too late to satanic rituals br br in every religious horror movie i have to assume that that movie's world is inhabited by god and by satan i also have to assume that satan can't be 1 000 000 times more powerful unless the movie has a world order resembling that of hell in other words where were the priests in this film who knew something the best that this movie's priest could do is guess that there are some witches about nothing else from reading all those books in his study at the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic then laughs hysterically only to finish in a major panic attack so this is supposed to be god's contribution to fighting satan ridiculous every good religious horror film has the powers of good equipped with some form of more or less supernatural power or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight evil in that sense this movie is quite idiotic as is the casting of the droll martin to play the high priest of the cult there is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky martin lead a satanic ritual i mean it didn't have to be christopher lee or but couldn't they have found someone less funny looking also why does the couple go back to the town after their car is put out of the running after their friendly encounter with the town's folk no sane person would have gone back they should've just walked on the man's explanation to his girlfriend and the viewer is that who knows what's in that direction
<START> if i assume that you know what this film is about i am also forced to assume that you've come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what i say if all this rings true read on you are likely to find some with at least part of this review if you're undecided or not really entirely certain what happened in the late '70s and early '80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective instead br br although i didn't grow up in california the american punk scene was the first music scene i ever truly lived in at the height of the hardcore i was immersed in from about 1979 1981 everybody had a band and the only common between bands and indeed members of their audiences were br br the rejection of conformity br br tolerance and enjoyment of difference br br a desire to have fun hard and fast br br hairstyles politics dislike of authority figures and violent slam dancing were not integral to what i experienced though there were certainly cliques or factions who tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress speak or act punk enough and there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascistic paradigm of anarchic self mutilating angry young cop haters br br although the interviews with audience punks in penelope excellent cal punk documentary decline of western civilization present a very narrow view of the subculture some of us enjoyed the interviews with the bands club owners promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of 'the scene' nevertheless it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged unfortunate as this is the blame for it rests solely with those who promote believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes not the film makers don't blame the messenger br br the music presented here is not going to be for everybody nor even most it's not the most crude stuff out there but it's loud obnoxious fast and less concerned with technique than with raw energy br br for me seeing early black flag with ron reyes singing x fear and the circle jerks was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film as much as i like the germs seeing darby crash for the mess and the nice guy that he was left me a bit cold nevertheless the scenes of darby playing with his pet tarantula while shut down droned on and on in the background were precious the x interview is also great br br straightforward documentary style is supplemented by wild pans and zooms during the musical segments during the interviews framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said considering her experience and the budget did as well as anybody could have with this film br br recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun honest direction less rebellion before punk was co opted into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy
<START> indeed cynthia is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond though i'm just wondering how she ended up as a patient' where hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight as seen from the previous episodes br br anyway this last episode is really suspended the ending is not so understandable i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming br br i just hope the next season will give light to more unclear hanging events that were happened br br just can't wait further for season 3
<START> this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be but i thought this was amazingly well acted and a powerful creation if lacking a little subtlety in i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play it creates an eeriness that works well with this flick i am also a great fan of alan rickman so that might be my bias personally i found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing this could in fact be anywhere and probably is i say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me and likely for anyone involved in any sort of political activity
