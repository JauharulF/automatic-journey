<START> i enjoyed carax's les amants du pont and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard well the first 10 minutes were ok but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life a sad disappointment
<START> i don't know which was worse the viewer's made dopes of or the stars in this movie who look like dopes am i to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed the child was a bit dark am i to believe her mother her father and her husband never once said hmmm this child looks a bit dark am i to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records that lisa hartman had this wow look on her face when she told her mother christopher is half black what was that for real gee do you think so so not only did the grandmother and grandfather look dopey and stupid never once mentioning this but i guess we were supposed to look surprised and say hmmmmm omg he is half black totally stupid movie almost an embarrassment even to watch this
<START> a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler br br the aristocats is regarded as one of walt disney's finest 2d animations with its charming script and cool characters but it doesn't quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle book br br the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin br br the young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with br br not the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments especially involving the cats and the dogs the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing br br the story after the boring beginning is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be there are hardly any lapses and no dull moments the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring not to mention two very strange british swans br br with disney you always get a strong meaningful message with the jungle book it is where you belong with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough it seems very far fetched and irrelevant br br my sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book cast br br despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to
<START> the quickie 1 outta 5 stars br br pretty poor movie an old as the hills story about a high ranking gangster who wants to quit passing on his empire to his inept son of course it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit so a contract is put out on his life after throwing a big party an exterminator jennifer jason leigh who i guess is never going to act in anything other than tv movies or low budget direct to video trash ever again is called to the scene our hero makes a pass at her offering her big money for a quickie she turns down his offer even though she needs the money but winds up staying overnight anyway even after being brutally harassed by the overzealous son who thinks she was sent to kill his father ugh the story just goes on and on you can see every twist and turn coming a mile away weird soundtrack by some group called the tiger lillies will drive most people nuts but i thought there was one kind of cool track towards the end or maybe i was just excited because i could tell that the movie was almost over jennifer jennifer jennifer what the hell happened to you
<START> make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck this film is a fun one to watch they really work well together as you would see in this movie the whole cast was very entertaining since i'm a dennis morgan fan this film was a real treat but everyone can enjoy it recommended
<START> pat o'brien had his best role ever as notre dame football coach from humble beginnings entered notre dame as a student circa 1910 he is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero br br upon graduation he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game in a way too bad the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher certainly far better and nicer than the one i had in high school erasmus hall in brooklyn to be exact br br he motivates his students he will not tolerate academic he is a coach for all seasons br br o'brien captures that common kind touch one of his students george is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by ronald reagan br br the years pass and the achievements run high but remains the same kind coach who testifies before congress when football is called into question br br donald crisp is outstanding as a notre dame priest who knew that was destined to coach football albert is adequate but his jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best was nominated that year in the supporting category for foreign correspondent br br tragic death in a plane crash robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human being the film is great
<START> nbc should be ashamed i wouldn't allow my children to see this i definitely would tell my church to stay away this movie is proof as to why nbc has always been a 3rd rate network the producers actors and writers should get on their knees and beg god's forgiveness for making this work of fiction there were no pirates noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark the ark had no deck lot wasn't even born when this event took place did anyone attached to this project try reading the bible there were more than two animals of each type taken read the story in genesis how could anyone bring this to any screen small or large
<START> at first glance of this mini i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and anjelica huston didn't return to the cast both john voight and barbara hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western br br cherokee jack jackson haysbert played an excellent bad guy and louis gossett jr was as always true to form with his excellent acting skills br br the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes including one of the best where the valiant shoot out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film return to lonesome dove was to me almost up to the quality of the first of the series the next 2 follow ups with james garner as call just didn't make it for me and that marries pea eye how the heck did that get in their that was a total mismatch of characters the first 2 of the series made the epic story the next 2 in no way were of the same quality br br now if the first 2 could be remastered in dolby digital and an anamorphic presentation the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today
<START> i must say that i didn't expect much sitting down to watch pitch black but i got a lot back in terms of excitement and pure fun it's the type of flick where you can just lean back relax and have a great time just being entertained this isn't a deep film by any means everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as alien predator or such but when i watch a rip off i want it to be good and this rip off is great br br it opens with a galaxy of stars some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene 2001 star wars alien predator a ship is cruising through space when inside the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awoken the ship has been hit by something they crash land on a nasty little planet with three suns everyone flocks out of the ship when they find that their prisoner transport richard riddick vin diesel has escaped confinement they scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him but they have no way of getting their ship to fly again they search the planet for water and civilization but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not too long ago br br then they find out that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black there also happen to be hoards of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet what are the chances they happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens what are the chances and riddick has a rare talent he can see in the dark again what are the chances br br there seems to be a lot of in this movie but a film like this isn't out to get oscars for originality or believability it's there to entertain the audience it does so with ease vin diesel is a big gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever but i've got to say if there's anyone who can fit the part of a trashy homicidal felon it is diesel listen to him mutter he did not know who he was fu ing with great stuff br br the aliens in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks those from alien and predators they've got long horizontal heads like a hammerhead the quick moving agility of the aliens and the stealth of a predator i assume david director and writer of the movie didn't expect audiences to believe his creatures were truly something never seen before at least i hope not br br aliens redux might be a better name for this movie but then again it is better than both the second and third alien films put together in a time when apparently ended series are getting revived terminator 3 alien 5 predator 3 alien vs predator pitch black stands out as a new series altogether two more sequels are planned let's just hope they don't get carried away i can just picture it twenty five years from now aliens vs predator vs pitch black aliens the fight of the year br br fight of the year title may be shared with the upcoming film freddy vs jason vs michael vs leatherface vs norman bates vs alien vs predator vs terminator vs james cameron vs the dinosaur br br 4 5
<START> age cannot tarnish the beauty of this east west love story for me ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of counter currents involving social conformity bigotry war doubt and the need for immense courage with hong kong as the backdrop this movie tells the story of a eurasian doctor and a u s journalist who meet and fall in love during the korean war as mark elliott william holden is intelligent breezy and a bit weak jennifer jones is perhaps well nigh perfect as dr han by turns doubt torn and ecstatic eager and hesitant others in the large cast include torin thatcher isobel murray matheson virginia gregg richard loo soo yong philip ahn jorja and donna martell many of hollywood's best oriental actors played smaller uncredited parts also the script by john patrick followed han's exquisite novel closely the direction by henry king was solid as always the thrust of the storyline is how unwilling han was to fall in love with elliott with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future and how unafraid he was despite the intolerance and interference they faced as their affair became known the film is unarguably physically busy interesting and often beautiful also the hill to which the lovers go to be apart the lovely bay where they swim are set against an already busy and crowded business city large social events and teeming streets hospital corridors and traffic filled arteries with cinematography by leon shamroy ben makeup and helen turpin's hairstyles the great work by set decorators sound and lighting art department and all concerned this has to be one of the most memorable productions set in a major non u s city of all time and one of the most difficult to capture on film yet what one remembers most here is the lovers thankfully not extremely young facing the odds against them and assessing exactly what they are then going ahead as if love mattered and those conditions which are set up as barriers to love do not the climax of the affair is mark's going back to war thereafter han receives his letters even after she knows he is has been killed they seem messages from a better wold a world where hope is all that matters courage is the price of admittance to that world and it is always summer on a high and windy hill set apart and above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be victimized made subject to ill fortune or brushed aside by militant forces of evil truly love is a many thing dr han says and this movie stands as one of that shining proofs as a pearl timeless as a chinese proverb and lovely as polished jade set against a rough background
<START> unlike bond and other detective movies alfred hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage and luck would get out of it jewel thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is vijay anand's tribute to the master of suspense the tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes vijay anand as a great director himself br br it is the story of a common man vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called amar who in fact is a jewel thief suddenly vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this amar who remains one step ahead of him the suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme just like hitchcock's movies jewel thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of br br everyone and i mean everyone dev anand vijay anand ashok kumar mala tanuja sd burman kumar etc etc are in their top forms this is one of the best thrillers ever made in india
<START> i'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising a k a not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate br br afraid i'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism great idea shame about the execution and it was most disconcerting to watch so many good actors as well as some very bad ones including the leaden lead all apparently thinking that they were appearing in a series of very different films br br i wish that a k a had been audacious innovative or just simply interesting sadly it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with arty aspirations a missed opportunity
<START> 1992's batman returns was tim burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one gotham city again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner it was also clever to see how burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman max christopher walken and the plan to make the penguin danny devito mayor of gotham anyway keaton again returns as batman bruce wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in selina kyle only ms kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous catwoman michelle pfeiffer a plan forms between both villains to destroy gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting the performance from michelle pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played the catwoman any better and devito was perfect as the penguin his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch batman returns is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive
<START> i'm a geena davis fan for life because of this movie i've always loved samuel l jackson and the two make a great pair on screen this said i think is the best action movie i've ever seen forget the twist endings that audiences have now come to expect and that filmmakers now try mostly failing to incorporate into their movies br br 10 10
<START> i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie it didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd the music was not bad it was quite nice usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes ali her acting had a lot to be desired however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie thank you
