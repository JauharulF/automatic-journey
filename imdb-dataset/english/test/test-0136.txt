<START> this film was bad i believe elton or is it mike wong starred in it anyway it was the wong that didn't have that goofy grin and looks meaner he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage he recovers and gets revenge gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film but he doesn't get to do much but what little he does seems to make the br br others pale in comparison also the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the wong guy controls this film is not worth renting or buying
<START> so we're supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle to the warzone just to find out why her fiancÃ©e didn't travel to switzerland or are we supposed to take it seriously it's not even remotely funny clever or entertaining it's stupid and so is the movie the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie even worse than jar jar binks dialog tries very hard to be funny almost all the time but it never is the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing and as for the plot did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for other than being anti government i guess that didn't matter to anyone neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield don't waste your time is neither funny nor entertaining
<START> this movie tries to rip off predator but that movie is much better this movie has truly terrible special effects and a mindless plot the team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientist is a combo of rough and rugged male delta commandos and pretty but tough female rangers none of them are too bright all the characters seem to be more than willing to run off into the forest alone and headfirst into a spear or sword and their death some of the pyrotechnics are very big and must have cost a bundle but the close ups of the creature are laughable as are most of the death scenes every clichÃ© that the writers could think of was used if you're looking for a mindless slaughter fest this may fill the bill the night i watched this was very slow so i sat through the whole thing i have to admit that it's been a while since i watched something this bad there is very little to redeem this movie i'm amazed that junk like this gets produced
<START> i cry at a lot of movies call me sentimental call me one of those viewers who always likes to see a happy ending this movie though it has a sad ending was great of all of the actors that i would love to have lunch with it would be sidney poitier his acting along with john cassavetes and jack warden of 12 angry men fame is stellar his character who befriends a man on the run cassavetes and helps him out in every way possible is incredible br br this is another one of those forgotten noirs made during the end of the noirish era it is well done has a superb cast extremely talented acting and great cinematography it is a film worth watching over and over again i highly recommend this one this is just another truly great film done by mr poitier and should be sold on dvd even though i cried kudos to such great art
<START> a masterful performance by jamie foxx is just one of the highlights of ray a 2004 film also starring kerry washington regina king curtis armstrong richard schiff sharon warren patrick and many others all giving excellent support to the film br br the film has several main focuses the first is charles' childhood the drowning of his brother george which haunted him for years the glaucoma that blinded him and the strength taught him by his mother don't bend don't break don't ever be a cripple she eventually sends him to a special school where charles' gift of music is discovered the next focus is charles' artistic evolution as a nat king cole like singer to his arrangements of gospel music his foray into country music and the unique sound that became ray charles the third focus is charles' personal life his marriage to bea his many affairs his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation br br because charles lived a packed 74 years there's a lot skipped though charles was orphaned while in his teens the death of his beloved mother his rock isn't in the film while he is shown on the circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs his near starvation as a musician isn't covered at one point he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it but the jar broke he was that down and out bea is shown with him when the state of georgia which banned him adopts georgia on my mind as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes charles back to his native state yet he and bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned she probably was there however also she wasn't his only wife he was married once before he met her that marriage isn't covered in the movie we're told of one illegitimate child there were 12 it would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film br br what isn't skipped is his glorious music which seems to go on constantly throughout the film continually reinforcing his genius and artistry br br charles' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout those who scoff at it as a made for tv movie don't give it the credit it deserves taylor direction gives ray a good pace and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully br br as ray jamie foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part foxx wore prosthetics did his own piano playing and spent a great deal of time with charles preparing for the role he nails him but it's not an impersonation he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body a man full of denial about his addiction hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked and he's in denial about his home life thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children in the movie child and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on he demands to be paid in 1 bills so they can be counted when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal he makes his own deal and leaves his job br br one doesn't so much marvel at foxx's performance as accept him as ray from the first time he appears on camera br br this is an excellent biography which like walk the line is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist whether or not you're a ray charles fan ray is something to experience
<START> i don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre i really don't dark yes bizarre no it i s sad and with lots of emotions specially with the story they say it has elements of s m but i really don't find anything of that sort except for catwoman's whip br br this movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade they have strong motives with strong feelings involved catwoman a great performance by michelle isn't just a sexy chick who likes jewels she's on her personal crusade and well by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him strong performance by danny devito again i think michael keaton is the best batman and he carries his costume well br br you can totally see that it is a tim burton movie because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy but also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions
<START> warning spoilers ahead even if i doubt that anybody hasn't seen this yet br br the movie starts off rather well but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny sugary sweet predictable and unrealistic romance' mess i mean it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage but these problems are never solved but just forgotten br br basically as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back without even asking all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and cliche' 'having a baby will change ending br br the two main characters' families and neighbours are also extremely one dimensional and don't seem to serve really any purpose if not to irritate the viewer and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the moments' start br br i am sorry to be ripping this movie but given the start i would have expected something more 4 10 for me
<START> despite its title is not really about drugs in the best tradition of crusading british tv drama analyses and about its ostensible subject which is not some mythical scourge but a matrix or process with identifiable social economic and historical roots causes and effects there is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four sets of characters from spectacularly separate global and class backgrounds a poppy grower forced into the pakistani underworld by poverty and a cynical government the english ex olympic swimmer wife of a drugs baron on trial for trafficking two shambling german policemen whose determination to convict the latter arises as much from class anger as any faith in the law and a tory junior minister whose cambridge student daughter has become an addict br br is unapologetically didactic from the early scenes of jack lithgow in pakistan investigating the government's success in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more british aid we are bombarded with facts about the problem but these 'facts' come from a variety of sources government representatives left wing lawyers with vested ideological and domestic interest in the corruption poor farmers who need to grow to survive br br facts normally reassuring markers on a map are clearly not enough the more facts we get the less the situation seems it is not until jack the film's moral centre the man who connects all the narrative threads actually journeys into the heart of the drugs darkness learns to shed his tory hypocrisy the use of drugs but refusing to put any serious money into tackling the problem and creating the conditions through various free market where drug flourishes just as the anti heroes of the old warners' gangster films were actually model american capitalists so the are the ideal being espoused by thatcher and reagan that at least the reality of the problem can be acknowledges br br like i say isn't really about drugs as jack finally recognises after being sacked as a tory minister drugs isn't really the problem it's a society dismantled by a woman who said there was no longer any such thing as proved by jack's non existent family life systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness increasing numbers of whom turn to drugs br br what is most frightening about is not the graphic numbing depictions of drug abuse the technical detail of which ironically reflects the presentation of more 'legitimate' verbal factual information but the dystopian vision of a britain stripped of any joy beauty or community a bleak wasteland of derelict tenements and soulless modernity a society of ready for the thatcherite smugglers and to ply their trade br br this isn't just a contemporary british story it records the decline of an empire built on trade reduced to lawless drug it is surely significant that the other sites in the programme are germany and pakistan crucial agents in the empire's decline here the old imperial amorality comes home to roost the formerly enslaved victims their bodies abused by their masters' power returning to the imperial centre london the seeds of its decline literally carried in their bodies embodying the fears of all those late 19th century gothic novels br br is one of the great achievements of british tv and is in many ways superior to the recent hollywood remake the political focus is obviously sharper jack's decline is much more effective than because he as agent of government policy as well as a bad father is very much part of the problem whereas the american's only real political flaw is complacency in almost every case characterisation is tighter and much more plausible compare lindsay duncan's steely helen already bitten by experience and failure and her risibly superficial counterpart br br unlike the dubious racial undercurrent of making mexico dark and other the ultimate wasp horror being sex with a black man the portrait of pakistan is richly tragically drawn with disconcerting arguments about drug protection punctuated by scenes of gruesome violence throughout the linking of public and private is expert visually the film is remarkably inventive without ever being flashy or especially in the last episode where the buildings and decor seem to move as the system closes in if like its remake feels the need to shore fragments then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is much more damning jack's speech bitterly despairing
<START> i have found this epic to be of an astonishing striking even heartbreaking beauty some kind of in beauty and decorative richness a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism the choreography herein is hugely enjoyable the actors are thoroughly enjoyable i have been a big fan of crouching tiger Â as well but this one was even better they have kitano's ingenuity in delighting in what is pleasurable this beauty affirming adventure cinema is an act of courage when was the suspense so exquisite and genuine and the art of showing huge crowds gigantic armies Â the film has something deeply satisfying and a steadfast good taste there is an enormous pleasure in making such a deliberately impressing and clean show Â it's good beyond words few few adventure films let alone epics gave me such an uninterrupted delight br br fan can be monumental not monumental is monumental fun like leone's movies like some '60s epics also like the hobbits trilogy it is fun
<START> john barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief lupin while no one knows for sure this is the case the inspector lionel barrymore is sure of it but cannot prove it so lionel spends much of the movie following john hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief br br although i liked the film i really think i had higher expectations for it and thought it might be better than just a very good time passer that's because it paired john and lionel barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors i think i expected sparks and magic but instead only caught glimpses of it here and there now this is not to say this is a bad film it certainly isn't it just didn't rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film i strongly recommend you see thanks an adequate script the film is pretty good but i was surprised to hear no french accents at all in the film even though it was supposedly about french people also there just wasn't much life in the film until it was nearly complete the ending was indeed excellent and entertaining so good that it elevated the film from a 6 to a 7 it's nice to see it ended on a high note
<START> a woman in love with her husband he's suicidal decides to have a baby to save his life she's been to a fertility clinic as has the lover she takes so both know how artificial insemination works but instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world the 5 turkey they engage in coitus we also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancÃ©e he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse further even though this is a business arrangement the first time she's with her sperm donor she takes off all her clothes as if it's a seduction plus her husband doesn't notice when 30 000 goes missing from their bank accounts does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most hollywood fare far fetched on all counts
<START> i like j horror anime and even kinda dig the pink movement which some have claimed this a member of but this did nothing for me i willing to go a step further and label this one of the biggest let downs of my film watching career br br three young go around getting their kicks out of raping girls one of the group starts to develop a about their pass time when his kid sister nearly catches them in the act invariably the group turns on itself as the once friends begin fighting with each other it ends on a down note befitting the film as a whole br br aside from watching the friends yell at each other which they do a lot there isn't a whole lot going on here the film is littered with long continual shots that only exacerbate the issue on top of that even when the film starts to do something interesting it suddenly gets bogged down in ethereal philosophy that never makes any sense for instance after one of the buddies has his change of heart about assaulting girls he goes out and does it again but then stops his buddies from taking their turns huh the cinematography is slow and lighting is poor the writing is ok as is the acting which makes this a sub par cinematic effort from the start mix the lack of technical prowess with the flimsy content and you have nothing more than a waste of time br br oh and one more extra note at least one of the girls that appears in the buff does not look old enough to be doing that kinda stuff br br 3 10
<START> 'a new generation' is the third amityville entry to base its plot around writer john g jones's premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners first a lamp then a clock and now a mirror however this is also the first amityville since 'the to directly tie in to the real life events that started the whole series this time around keyes terry robert partridge an artist is given a macabre looking mirror by a homeless man one day soon enough people around him start to die eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house indeed on the very night a man named franklin sonny in ii' murdered his entire family unfortunately for terry his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood br br this 7th installment in the often worn out franchise is something of a disappointment for me things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven yet entertaining 'it's about time' and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots not the first episode but the source material itself it should have been better than it was br br however three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me to say the least one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series on the one hand it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity but at the very least they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly not repeat them over and over again br br there's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition fest brings since you already know what's going to happen the carefully paced build up is simply slow and tedious or maybe it's just tedious anyway director john probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices which lacks any kind of subtlety there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities if they don't take it too seriously why should we br br which is a shame because 'a new generation' has a more than capable cast i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name in the credits she captivated my attention just as she always does and if anything i was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive terry o'quinn was equally charismatic and again underused partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over coiffed lumberjack shirted square jawed hero type and while i'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed it's not as if anyone here is performing ibsen br br the sets are also worthy of note from the dramatic artwork filling room to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback supernatural sequences getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories clearly is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror unfortunately it is meant to be a horror film after all br br 'a new generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should however it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours honestly the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'the for whom the story won't be such a massive deja vu trip
<START> i'll admit that i've never seen waiting for guffman 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant when the advertising for best in show had the tagline from the team that brought you waiting for guffman a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film for shame critics for shame times two any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world but this is one film that i hope people will experience now that its video dvd best in show is without a doubt the best comedy of 2000 br br the film begins with a mockumentary style introducing the main competitors not to mention screwballs of the annual best in show competition where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog we have the loveable and harry pepper guest with his the simple gerry cookie fleck levy o'hara with their nut case yuppies hamilton meg swan hitchcock posey the gay dog scott dolan stefan higgins and the airheaded millionare sheri ann ward cabot coolidge along with her trainer christy cummings lynch they all have their minds on one simple object the blue ribbon which will be awarded to the best dog and do i have to tell you the rest br br director writer star guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that the idiocy of films like american pie or other pointless teenage flicks won't take over the world after all his idea is simple make your comedy not just funny but smart funny but instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like zero effect and high fidelity he used a rather unusual approach and as i understand he also used this approach for guffman whether you notice or not a very large part of the film is improvisation in other words what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script maybe even not even dreamed of by guest and co writer star levy but with a gentle hand from guest he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other less adept actors now that's smart br br the cast is of course what makes improv work the most all of them are a comedic marvel to behold especially guest as pepper but the real standout has to be fred as buck laughlin the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of that is if the announcer was trying to be funny can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press there's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a doggie style of a time its priceless as is his performance br br i hope that people engage in this 90 minute the film deserves so much recognition it did get nominated for best picture comedy at the golden globes but didn't win i can't see why i mean in the comedy department it is best in show br br grade a
<START> lowe returns to the nest after yet another failed relationship to find he's been assigned to jury duty it's in the plans to somehow get out of it when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade br br through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl played by camp lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear camp of attempted murder while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time br br i've heard that st augustine is the oldest city in the us and i also know it has some ties to de leon so the backdrop is a good place to start unfortunately it's the only thing good about this movie the local police are inept the judge is an idiot and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like joanie cunningham i don't know whether to blame the director for poor direction or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effort br br in short this movie was so boring i could not even sleep through it 1 out of 10 stars
