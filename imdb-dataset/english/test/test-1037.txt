<START> i have so much hope for the sequel to gen x luckily my hopes have came true you got a whole bunch of action comedy silly comedy and surprises i think the newcomer edison is really a hit in the movie but i really find sam's 'alien' stupidly annoying with english although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong the action set up is much stronger than the 1st br br this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60 of the movie is in english from the cantonese this movie will not disappoint you i recommended this for young 'uns that care about pure action packed fun br br
<START> young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick up truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember we've seen this a thousand times before already and approximately nine hundred and ninety nine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans as it doesn't feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick it's very sadistic and nasty but every teenkill slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays so that's no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writer director john damn well realized that the ultra thin basic storyline nearly wasn't enough to fill a whole movie with and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldn't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck ran over him twice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length i've ever seen instead of all the pointless padding should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie alexander's character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren't painful enough if you ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face that's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but you're better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called they're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror but they'll have to come up with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
<START> spoilers with the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten whole and alive by the fish br br the movie piranha piranha starts with this scary looking piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but spoiler that's the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a piranha is the movie again what you do see is a travelogue of venezuela and it's people and the venezuelan jungle along the amazon river basin together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but that's about all br br there is some kind of a story that has to do with this great white hunter william smith which ironically means piranha in the native language spoken there is this what the title of the film piranha piranha really meant the person is played by legendary hollywood hell's angles biker and all around tough guy william smith br br at the beginning of the movie this trio of american tourists jim and his sister terry peter capri and their american guide art green tom are on their way into the venezuelan jungles to go sight seeing with terry taking photos to send back home terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun even when art saves her life using one when see's attack by a six foot long rattlesnake terry almost belts him for having a gun which he promised her he wouldn't take along with him on the trip br br at a jungle rest stop or bar the three run into who we first saw catching monkey's in the jungle at the start of the movie makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the amazon basin br br even though a bit strange at first the guy is so in to himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are any people around him turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with art even shows terry who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes don't really die but become a part of him after he kills them a bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination br br it's much later in the movie that for some strange reason maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty fighting that he's almost left unconscious just when about to finally kill art he's shot to death by terry who after experiencing what this insane nut job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life saving occasions br br worth watching if worth watching at all only for the scenery and nothing else it's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish or piranha horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with smith he does have the build for it playing tarzan of the venezuelan not african jungle
<START> 'in the line of fire' is one of those hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit but although i've seen it a few times i usually end up sitting through the whole thing again why it's good clint eastwood is great as usual and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual the character secret service agent frank is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect president kennedy in dallas and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president however the film doesn't make him a depressed brooding and obsessed character he's charming and personable and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin he's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by rene russo the killer played by john malkovich at his best is cerebral deliberate and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death he even goes by the name of another presidential assassin john booth br br the film is consistently enjoyable and it delivers all the goods suspense action romance and drama all in their proper amounts it's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it
<START> this movie has it all it is a thriller a chase movie a romance story a mob tale a comedy a road movie well in fact it's none of this at all br br all the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen but no you are still watching the same dull uninspiring and superficial clichÃ© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility a hit man with his quirks a girl who's playing hard to get mob guys acting tough and incapable cops yawn br br i'd recommend not to watch backtrack if you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor go and see 'the three of by tommy lee jones now that's what i call worth watching
<START> most of the brigitte bardot movies i've seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence unfortunately she was given few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality which was a real oversight she deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way as genevieve in love on a pillow we had a clear exception to the trend of light fluffy vehicles for it was an interesting artistic film by any reasonable measure and in it a 28 year old bb was at her most alluring une parisienne is another featuring an extremely captivating brigitte in an interesting well crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious lady's man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife there are several good performances here her playboy husband michel is one the prince played by charles boyer is another with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast as for brigitte bardot the way she looks in this movie is the way i remember her as a kid in the fifties she was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time more beautiful than any other actress of the period including marilyn monroe her curvy coquettish sexuality amply displayed in several bosom baring skintight dresses simply jumps off the screen she was more hip and cute than the women of america are today nearly fifty years later obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians in stark contrast the sex kitten was sexually liberated intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity she used it for a higher purpose than mere self interest she believed in love a still photo simply could not do her justice you had to watch her slender yet voluptuous form with its 20 inch waist lightly cross a room you had to see that wild blonde mane gaze into her big brown seductive eyes and listen as her full pouting lips spoke french in a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera her beautiful orbs twinkling what a babe for fans of brigitte bardot une parisienne is not to be missed
<START> how can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of peter cushing the determination of donald pleasence and the bust of peters easy you give them a terrible script to work with br br peter cushing in an evil role leads a satanic cult that has captured a couple friends of donald pleasence donald plays a determined but aloof priest that desires to locate his friends but needs the help of fred from scooby doo to locate them he summons the help of a new york who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon in his task meanwhile the girlfriend of one of the missing people peters joins the search if all this sounds interesting then you like myself were mislead br br it doesn't take long for the trio to sniff out the baddies but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish also women will find this a crapfest every time they get on the bad guys trail our two male heroes tell to stay at the hotel even though she can handle herself better than the squeamish priest played by pleasence br br story the script really lets us down no tension is built no worthwhile dialogue is given the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times peters is told to stay behind and let men do men work if you're interested in seeing a minotaur on film don't bother we get a statue of a minotaur that spits flames br br violence there are some attacks and a few sacrifices but those of you who drool for gore will be letdown br br acting even though there are three of my favorite actors in this film there is nothing redeemable here peter cushing doesn't have much screen time donald pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and peters is ill used this should have been much better given the talent involved but then again the yankees lose a game here and there too br br nudity peters takes a bath but you see next to nothing she isn't as obliging here as she was in the flesh and blood show
<START> a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this this is however the first time i have been compelled to write a review of one br br put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen even worse then boggy creek ii br br the entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when dr klaus stands in this chamber thing turns all vampire ish br br the only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers but for all the wrong reasons
<START> i was in my early 20's just graduating from college when this movie appeared seeing it was event of great impact not only because of the high quality of the film as evidenced by its many awards but because of its place in the historical context of 1959 because of social progress since then it is nearly impossible to fathom that my college had only begun admitting carefully screened black students in 1953 a mainstream high budget with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959 br br the movie was given a deluxe roadshow reserved seat presentation in only the best theatres complete with a souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color multi track stereo sound etc almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie gershwin's music superbly performed and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving br br i was recently able to obtain a faded copy of a two hour cutting of the film and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame but the musical quality has not diminished sammy davis and pearl bailey are masterful in their portrayals what a crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the peak of their careers
<START> i've seen three of the animatrix episodes and this is my favorite of all of them the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe program was a stylistically impressive number it just felt kind of silly i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from watanabe director of the incredibly popular and for good reason series cowboy bebop it has some of the best elements of bebop slick sci fi adventure a no nonsense slightly apathetic hero working for hire a bounty head more or less and a chase scene all wrapped up in an excellent film noir packaging watanabe's tarantino style slickness comes through here full throttle
<START> the 2005 edition of the royal rumble came live from the save mart centre in california the two top championships of the wwe were being defended the undertaker was battling in a casket match shawn michaels was taking on edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last october and of course the every man for himself over the top rope royal rumble match itself who was going to take the price this year chris benoit edge eddie guerrero edge john cena batista edge shawn michaels there was no shortage of contenders br br it was batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy or should i say a botched finish batista and john cena were the final two men in the ring batista was supposed to dump the young smackdown star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor the referees acted on their feet as we had an arm raising contest similar to that of bret hart and lex luger back in 1994 this brought out the chairman of the board vinnie mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring it was unusual to see vince mcmahon sitting legs out telling the two men to restart the match batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped cena to the floor sealing his own future with a championship match at wrestlemania 21 br br the undercard for this years royal rumble had a very solid line up with many of wwe's biggest stars competing in matches each brand had two big matches each br br raw opened the night with the match between shawn michaels and edge this was a good technical contest back and fourth all the way until edge got the pinfall this was a smart booking decision and kept edge as a contender to the world heavyweight championship br br the second match of the night was the feud ending casket match between the undertaker and the match was not a classic but then again have their been any classic casket matches it was entertaining especially when got involved and then kane popped out the casket to a great pop the undertaker surprised no one when he got the win slamming the lid on and this mediocre feud br br the first of the two championship matches of the night was john bradshaw defence of the wwe championship in a triple threat match against both kurt angle and the big show this match was very good again not a classic but entertaining none the less jbl took the win after pinning kurt angle his celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy long informed him at no way out he would defend the wwe championship in a barbed wire steel cage match against big show not a very nice way to spend a sunday night br br and of course there is no show without punch punch of course being reigning world heavyweight champion triple h his rematch from unforgiven 2004 with randy orton was lot better than the original encounter it's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to the game br br so the first big one of 2005 was a good one it achieved its goals feuds ended and new ones began we were now officially on the road to wrestlemania 21
<START> how to summarize this film it is simply impossible why you should see it maybe for the story very probably for the actors giorgio catherine above all for the universe and the poetry this is a tale sad sometimes dark but a tale i love this film just waiting for the dvd thank you mister

<START> the whole exercise is pointless why make the film at all the lighting is ghastly but the sound is just a joke like a high school production whoever put the budget together for this film should be drawn and quartered for allowing it to be made without the proper budget for with equipment fit for recording br br so much dialog is unintelligible due to losses in echo or the lack of proximity to the mic economy should have been made on any other area the whole production is lifeless and just lame with such amateurish half arsed production it lacks warmth clarity and has no design to it
<START> this film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department awful awful awful it's only around eighty minutes long but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an andy warhol film then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting br br where to start the putrid script the disgusting cinematography the so bad its bad acting the spectacularly dismal effects dreadful music or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve this film is an incoherent shambles br br a particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when dominic decides to shoot a cat cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average english accent god damn to right that woman god damn this horrendous monstrosity br br everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again
