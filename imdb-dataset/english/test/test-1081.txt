<START> the film is one of the best horror films i have ever seen overall i'm not a big fan of horror films but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching however as they are based on horror i know that the stories are unreal as they are fictional therefore i can't take them all seriously on the other hand is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films br br this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline most horror films i've seen are all quite fake but because was so incredibly sophisticated and directed with superb acting especially by craig sheffer aaron boone amazing special effects great lighting and fantastic dialogue i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody whatsoever that many other horror films have as well as being horror has elements of thriller romance and action all rapped in one if you haven't seen this film i recommend you watch it as i rate it a 10 10
<START> the casting and direction in undercurrent is more insipid than inspired in this noir clunker that fails from the outset to get off the ground robert taylor's wooden style poses a roadblock almost immediately for the highly affected kate hepburn and it's bad chemistry from the outset br br naive and innocent ann hamilton hepburn falls for handsome airplane manufacturer alan taylor and rushes to the altar with him she soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him as alan becomes more remote she delves further into the murky past and ann soon finds herself living a nightmare instead of the american dream br br undercurrent resembles a few hitchcock plots but vincent minnelli rapidly establishes he is no master of suspense hepburn is no shrinking violet and she is a hard sell for a character more suited to the reticent styles of teresa wright or joan fontaine minnelli never really succeeds in getting kate to defer in desperate fashion to taylor's limited abilities as an actor her attempts come across as silent gish while taylor's wide descent into madness takes on restrained bela lugosi robert mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother talk about piling on br br cinematographer karl provides some highly stylized noir interiors but minnelli and cast utilize the atmospherics meekly and the tension remains tepid with minnelli far from his forte musicals and hepburn's victim role fitting her like a bad suit undercurrent drowns all involved
<START> the residents are a band known for their strange appearances and odd musical stylings so obviously their music videos aren't going to be exactly normal in fact these little videos are abnormal and bizarre but have a huge artistic value to them the atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals it's a great watching experience br br basically icky flix just consists of many residents music videos made for their songs the music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like it's straight out of an 80s horror film what doesn't change is the quality of these videos they're great br br any fan of art films will love these they're so original with their visuals and the angles they are filmed at and the lighting especially make these so interesting the music is creepy and catchy and highly original and these short films are mini classics that deserve multiple watchings this is a near perfect collection of short videos br br my rating out of 56 mins
<START> i know i loved this movie when i was 12 14 years old now that i am 24 i watched it again and i wished i hadn't because all the things i laughed at when i was younger is no longer funny so this is an hour and a half without fun for me the jokes were lame not funny or just too childish so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid is now the things i don't like about it besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is and the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on but if you are young you will probably love it i rate this movie 4 10
<START> is torture ever right no the answer is simple and absolute with no qualifications possible the reason as this film showed is the effect torture has on a society the values that have been hard fought for in western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are for all men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society one where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as humans to protect this society institutions have been developed to deal with wrongdoing openly fairly and honestly these institutions have been adapted and honed through generations of hard work one could argue that these are the true of democracy as they belong to us all allow us all to be heard if we allow inhumane acts to be committed in our name if we split our society into those who have rights and those who don't then we undo the work of our ancestors moreover we are all complicit and all guilty and tainted whether those that we accuse are guilty or not is of no importance we are defined by our attitudes and our responses
<START> this is one of the best films i have ever seen how anyone can knock this movie just my imagination first of all gooding's and harris's performances were simply spectacular especially gooding that is the only way i can describe the acting spectacular you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off then you see gooding and his performance was magical as for the plot since it was based on a true person it goes where the lives of the characters go for all the action buffs it might be a little slow but then it's not an action film i definitely give this movie a 10 it deserves nothing less
<START> it looked cool from the movie sleeve but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest the film quality was poor and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film may god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what i can only describe as my new one and only reason why i never will want to see or trust an australian made film again i have to write more so i will again say that the actors were so bad that i'm positive i could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of trojans please don't see this movie for your own sake
<START> however closely the movie is to the comics it doesn't matter this movie radically moves away from the boredom of interview with the vampire although it's acting was good and slides in the wonderful action scenes very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all disadvantage poor graphics does it matter nope
<START> in all honesty i haven't seen this film for many years but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze i can't risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way you have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days i don't know if it's available on home video or not but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults
<START> i have found this show by accident and was surprised to find out that nobody i know has ever heard of it this was by far one of the best shows i have seen in months if not years and i cannot wait for more episodes to come out sleeper cell portrays a psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside of a terrorist cell who has to constantly make difficult decisions in order to maintain his cover while staying true to his real cause this is an extremely well done show it keeps you intrigued from the first episode till the end and though progressing slowly is fast enough for you to feel on the edge quite realistic and humane it touches on important topics and every episode presents an interesting question to ponder about this show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on tv and is not trying to be anything either it is genuine and unique it is a show about a human being his difficult choices and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything br br i gave this show a 10 for great storyline good progression excellent cinematography excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell
<START> seriously i thought it was a spoof when i saw it at the rental store but i realized it was just crap i can't even believe i didn't shut it off like we all know those snakes weren't they were pythons and gardner's the acting was lame and i still cant believe the ending loll if your gonna watch it just watch it for the end it was seriously priceless way better then 6th sense i don't even know if the makers of the movie actually thought this title would fly the only time it is really going to fly is when i throw it in the garbage just watch it for a laugh it was hilarious in the stupidest way don't buy just rent
<START> some teen agers go to an old deserted farm house left to one of them by their dead grandfather unaware that there had been several murders there decades earlier because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest couldn't the guy have thought of something better to sell his soul for the man's grandson and his friends are set up to be the next sacrifice for reasons which are never explained the stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend the black guy with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians have to do battle with three killer scarecrows but don't be tricked like i was this isn't nearly as fun as it sounds it's mostly just a lot of chit chat about ball kicking dope smoking and the lead actor complaining about never knowing his parents the camera work is atrocious and shaky maybe done on a hand held camcorder in some scenes which maybe a good thing since the scarecrows look like they just came from some kid's birthday party and apparently they could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows some of the best movies i've seen have been these low budget independent horror movies but this one is just pathetic the cast and crew seems to have just been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other had never acted before and had no intention of acting again and had a few thousand dollars i can't believe this movie cost 130 000 to make and a weekend of free time on their hands even the lesbian skinny dipping scene is lame br br i think it's amusing also that as of this writing there is a sequel to this film which no one has even bothered adding to imdb br br out of and i only rate it that highly only because of the skinny dipping scene no matter how lame it may be
<START> solid documentary about kids who first surf then skate in the face of the american dream sadly some of the youngest and most gifted succumb to the lure of drugs while others become slaves to the crass marketing of their go for broke instincts few come out on top but the die is cast and fruit of it all is the new national pastime skateboarding the new york times notes that it was once considered a snub to authority now however skateboarding has its own summer camps video games magazines actually it always had these and corporate sponsors commercialism co opts another kid cultural
<START> now for sure this is one of the lightest hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet it is still touching i really like bruce's style and persona i haven't loved everything he has ever been in but he brings it to the 'big time' for me in most all his film endeavors br br the story begins he is power confidence and style with a capitol 's' he drives a porshe he lives well in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city that's russell he is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it his acclaim he is russell he knows what it takes to make it it just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation ally set there is a problem an intruder at his home the alarm has been activated br br russell can't seem to figure out for the moment what is happening to him it's different and yet it is somehow familiar a small boy who looks exactly like him as their lives run smack dab into each other there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him you have unfinished business to take care of now br br amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life she works with him puts up with his and yet she is smitten with russell very much so with rusty his past now in the picture and talking a mile a minute singing too late at night everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly br br willis is fun egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable disney modern times classic 'the kid' and to add his little heavy duty side kick spencer breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure chi mcbride is an inspirational supporting character as he is the heavy weight champ teaching 'little' rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground br br all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even lillie tomlin as the secretary and aide to russell i originally saw this back in and then again years later with equal enjoyment this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly
<START> why it's none other than ator played hilariously bad by miles o'keefe surprisingly i had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before mystery science theater 3000 tore it to pieces i highly recommend checking out the mst3k version since it's hilarious and one of their best episodes ever br br the movie on it's own is basically the kind of typical b movie crud that italian film makers were churning out in the early to mid 80's this film was apparently made to cash in on the conan craze but it fails miserably on all counts br br keep an eye out for the scenes where ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang glider during a cutaway br br thong fish is ready br br rating the movie itself 1 the mst3k version 10
