<START> this one isn't even lively enough to be fun something is out there ripping people off off screen after a spaceship crash off screen while government executives investigates off screen and bad actors says stupid lines on screen including a guy who looks like jim carrey with a hangover the monster when it finally is shown looks like an extra from robot monster but there ain't enough monster fu anyway br br fortunately it's pretty short skip it unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this
<START> if only disney had stayed away from it see i think that this movie has some potential well the main character's situation does at least take out the whole jordan cahill thing and you've got the beginnings of a decent movie of course you also lose more than half of the film but oh well not that much of a loss br br so here it goes you take a typical preppy suburban teenage girl danielle panabaker who's actually a decent actress whose best friends screech a lot mostly over a pop sensation i'm assuming it's a direct quote from the movie movie's like this almost always involve that particular phrase named jordan cahill except of course wants more out of life enter brenda song's character a sophisticated individual who is just what needs honestly i don't care what the character's real name is i like the acronym better the two new friends go to see jordan cahill one to drool one to make fun of the and they come out of it with his cell phone hijinks ensue and everything turns out alright in the end br br if only disney or any major film studio for that matter didn't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them it's sugar coated crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with a little film called 'high school musical' comes to mind
<START> okay so maybe the acting wasn't bad but i am typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come the chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer guy and few people other than uninvolved bystanders and the seem to dispute her so what is the point of staying with this drama beats the heck out of me i kept thinking or hoping there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation but none was forthcoming in summary i cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless tv movie based on a true story or not
<START> original movie lovers can actually love this show if they just stop complaining all the time br br the emperor's new school brings up some old jokes from the movie like pulling the lever to lab and pausing the episode but since it's a kids show it's just classic and is in their right places even though the style is much more simple the animation and characters keeps their personalities very well and it surprised me actually eartha kitt makes excellent voice acting for and j p does a wonderful job for voice instead of david spade who played in the movie great plots hilarious moments and amazing looks makes this show worth watching just stop complaining about everything
<START> great film about an american g i who quits the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war she accepts but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and such meanwhile her brother and an old friend form an anti american terrorist group called the werewolves their purpose to drive away the occupants you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von trier's film europa zentropa james best best known for his role as roscoe p coltrane in the 1980s television show the dukes of hazzard is shockingly excellent as the american he should have become a big movie star Â at this age he reminds me very much of warren beatty the other main actors are good as well fuller's direction is quite good using a lot of long takes again although they are not nearly as complex as they were in park row the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue the only problems lie in the script as seems to be the case with all of the fuller films that i've seen it's not too badly flawed but it ought to have been expanded fleshing out major characters and parts of the script helga the wife goes through a major change but completely off screen therefore the emotional center rests squarely on best's shoulders fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film i hope that doesn't sound too harsh she just doesn't really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed she has so few lines but fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on i would have had her death solidify david and relationship myself and the film ends too abruptly and it lacks payoff these aren't really the biggest flaws in the world the way i described them makes them sound bigger than they are 9 10
<START> this is one of four 1970s movies by tv writer lane slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns they feature likable tv personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars including light touch love interests the others are they only kill their masters james garner 1972 and the girl in the empty grave and deadly game both andy griffith 1977 br br alda's is set near vermont mount angel next to horse creek the others in california garner's at seaside eden landing and griffith's in the mountains jasper lake all try to capture the feel of a small town to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it on that level they are somewhat entertaining that they were often re run itself suggests they have some appeal but they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue slack pacing bland settings flat or exaggerated characters and off putting forced attempts often juvenile or crude at color or humor br br alda's and garner's are the most serious about story characters pacing and tone they have the best supporting casts though alda's is put to better use the griffith casts pale in comparison alda's has the best director br br shocking has some surprise and drama the killer's method is inventive the tone is more even and the dialogue more natural than in griffith's alda's film does not suffer like the others from smug big city transplants to the town or from hokey exaggerated local characters both of which come across as figments of a hollywood scriptwriter not as genuine the worst offender is the griffith movies' pipsqueak mumbling moron whit who we are told tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch dragged away the dock for the police boat stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them and filled out 11 on the withdrawal slip of t only to be discovered by the teller mercifully absent is the clunky heavy handed repetitive style dialogue from the griffith movies you going to lunch i'm going to take out the boat you going to take the boat to lunch i'm not going to lunch you're not going to take the boat to lunch there aren't any fish in this lake why are you fishing here it's illegal in horse mountain it's posted here too you're breaking the law some law there aren't any fish in this lake then why are you fishing here i told you it's illegal in horse mountain please call me lloyd my name is lloyd okay lloyd call me lloyd that's my name my name is lloyd br br but alda is too low key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small time police chief certainly not a red hot lawman in demand by a rival town slate has the character admit as much when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue as a result of an accidental name recognition rather than detect or investigate barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial his secretary lasser feeds him a key clue why didn't i think of that he says an embarrassing funeral scene plus a plot contrivance leads to another gift clue br br worse barnes is more interested in the military style helmets of the county police sent to help him deadly game also suggests slate has something against the military than leading them or his own men effectively he allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control again he is ineffective and nearly killed in the climactic scene which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected by accident the erratic northeastern accent that alda affects does not help believability br br there are plot holes why would the killer strike after all these years and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible but they are nothing compared to later ones a couple together a shopkeeper in his store during business hours a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and unbelievably his dog br br alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies barnes first appears in a motel bed he then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids this and talk about the female doctor smack of a crude mean spirited pattern garner's film has been described as sleazy including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her griffith's feature an ersatz ropers routine in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into the supply closet a gratuitous locker room type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death did you take her out i took her in once a reference to bank teller bernice as swollen up in places and to sticking a pin in her and to hating and firing secretary maude because she was too hairy a description of the female doctor's practice as two tables and a flashlight a humiliating scene in which fran ryan propositions griffith offering some home grown and an insulting subplot in which a woman pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon seems to sleep around br br finally alda's film has a grim bleached out colorless lifeless look and feel only louise lasser adds spark at least the other films had some spirit scenery and pleasant music griffith's got out onto the mountainside onto the lake and even out into the big city you feel more like re watching masters or empty grave than shocking
<START> everything is illuminated a young jewish american searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape nazi persecution while embarking on a cross european tour with some unlikely associates br br liev schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos when successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask check we usually get a mishmash of genres check but what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible intelligent and moving br br elijah wood plays jonathan an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes he is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph the sepia picture bears his grandfather an uncanny resemblance to him and the woman to aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a hip hop loving break dancer alex eugene his apathetic and perma vexed grandfather boris and his dog sammy davis junior jr what ensues is essentially a comedy there is an un patronisingly simple introduction with voice overs alex's is especially funny as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969 proving how popular he is with the chicks and break dancing thus setting him up as jonathan's antithesis br br schreiber begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves all three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something schreiber was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is the horrors that are allowed to crack through i e the past are presented in an almost palatable tone incidental music cinematography which make them all the more unsettling br br as the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really are br br elijah wood is as authentic as usual bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen formally a resident good in lord of the rings and a resident evil in sin city he plays jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth boris as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled however it is eugene as alex that makes the show the director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmicky br br schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul the continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity truth and family if there was a complaint it would be the speed at which the film changes direction though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of world war 2 in a completely fresh fashion br br chi
<START> born bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining the movie is similar to the black circle boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences
<START> this movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun friendship escape danger sex maturity etc the problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level which is why it failed to build a decent story around them i couldn't follow the point of any part of this story nor any reason why i should care br br this movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all it's basically about a girl being in love with her sister and her sister being in love with the idea of men while the latter tries out her love of men the former tries to win her sister back by getting even br br the plot is weak the characters are weak and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker without the sexual substance
<START> since i'm from norway one of the top ten or so richest countries in the world it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times and since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in norway during the five minutes of the shooting there mr direct to video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice so he must have powerful friends in the customs br br please do at least some research before going to an exotic country dudes you may hurt the feelings of old fans br br old fan with hurt feelings
<START> this movie was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nation a patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramatically a definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the over the top acting you often saw in other films of the day br br one annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
<START> this film is about a young man's painful journey to discovering his sexuality br br the film is raw and unpretentious it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times and some events are not properly explained i can understand it though because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life br br the low budget of the film is clearly discernible it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done the narration and some dialogs particularly the scene in the classroom with the french teacher have so much echo which makes it hard to make out what is said the ambient noise notable traffic noise is also captured throughout the film when a scene cuts into another the level of traffic noise changes br br this film is probably not entertaining but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embracing his sexuality
<START> although the concept of a 32 year old woman portraying a 12 year old girl might be a stretch for today's br br sophisticated audiences in the 1920's this was what the fans of mary pickford desired and expected from their favorite star the opening scene displays annie's tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multi ethnic street gang in comic battle with a rival group the sight of a young girl being in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude but the scene is played in such an our gang fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously anyway annie can dish it out as well as take it once annie returns to her tenement home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire it becomes more difficult especially in close ups to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street urchin however for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief the rest of the movie has it's rewards vacillating between comedy annie's gang puts on a show to sentiment annie plans a birthday surprise for her irish policeman father to tragedy her father is killed on his birthday the film gives mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era br br of course the requisite happy ending is eventually achieved the evildoers are apprehended with the help of annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day which is a good a way as any for a mary pickford movie to end br br
<START> if this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the wga a professional association of screenwriters then it's time to hang up the word processor astonishingly inept writing direction production at every level even for a tv movie no cliche goes in this jaw droppingly bad movie what were they thinking does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this
<START> please if you haven't attempted to sit through this garbage and are considering viewing this flick mini series do yourself a favor and find anything else to do floss your teeth start learning to play the cello beat your dog anything you choose will be time better spent than watching this junk this is not a bad movie that you can get a few chuckles out of it simply sucks in every way possible just boring from beginning to end br br and for those animal lovers out there that feel my comment above is insensitive if your dog could speak he or she would beg for a beating rather than suffer through watching this mess
