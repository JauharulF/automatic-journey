<START> i saw this short film on the dvd for ridley scott's film the there was no introduction by scott before the film it just started right up br br boy and a bicycle is hardly an example of ridley scott's other work it bears no resemblance the film shows a boy played by tony scott riding around on a bicycle guess what that's pretty all that happens the boy rides around rambling on and on with pointless confusing dialogue the film was shot in black and white and since it was directed by ridley scott i expected some cool cinematography or visually striking sets instead i was treated with nothing this film isn't even good for a first effort however i recommend that any fan of ridley scott should check it out at least once
<START> i was actually planning to see this movie when i noticed it in my tv guide but after about 5 minutes decided time is definitely more precious than who's that girl could ever be worth describing how bad madonna's acting looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film this crap is an insult to movies and intellect i almost never rate a movie i don't see from start to finish but in this case the former is impossible 2 10
<START> i will always think of mr firth as dorian gray if i live to be 100 br br perfectly acted and directed bringing oscar wilde's insight wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television br br more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money br br a must have for all wilde fans and indeed for everyone else inspired and perfected every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done br br by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired watch it then try to watch another version it's just not the same is it
<START> when a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small texas town people start to die the county sheriff tries to investigate but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials it turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woods br br i like low budget science fiction and horror movies i like monster movies so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie sadly i didn't br br i don't mind the bad acting the corny dialog the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad it's good kind of way br br but where others of that type and night fright differ is that night fright just has terrible pacing and it drags on because of that there are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening the searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods but nothing interesting is going on if these scenes were shorter the movie might not have been as boring though i don't think simply cutting those scenes would save this one br br i have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that i gave it a chance before slamming it in this review sadly it has gotten worse with each watch there won't be a fourth
<START> up at the villa fooled me into thinking i d be watching something similar to gosford park the film opens at a ballroom in 1930s italy which is populated by vulgar americans and uptight upper class brits but in truth up at the villa plays out far more like a merchant ivory production which is very bad news because it s a very slow and i do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely if you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie i didn t
<START> this movie was a complete waste of time the soundtrack was bad story was lame and predictable and the acting was terrible one of the worst 25 movies i have ever seen after the first ten minutes the rest of the film was completely obvious
<START> i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good and i watched a video on it so i was really into watching it i watched it and damn the fighting scenes are really good if the guys can't fight like that in real life they sure fooled me there isn't as much fighting as i would like i have to say but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular they don't show much but you can tell it's violent and cool but there's also the plot that goes around a love triangle between the main characters though it's a bit twisted tae sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble as well as fights he's the leader of his school and is the rival of won who's the leader of his own school a bit of a playboy hot headed and a rich boy then there's han a girl with not a lot going for her her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother the guy she liked is dating her old friend and then she meets won who goes to her school and tae sung who calls her older sister eventually she discovers tae sung is her brother fruit of one of her father's affair and he loves her despite of their blood relation meanwhile won falls for her and takes her as his boyfriend but she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother who confesses her love to her overall it's a wonderful movie but if i was really depressed after the end and i just couldn't help but think damn are all korean movie i watch about fighting death depressing stuff incest 'cause that sure was the case with old boy and temptation of wolves it's a very good movie but people have to be ready to cry at the end
<START> this movie is a must see for any war movie buff one of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as br br if i say its safe to surf this beach captain then its safe to surf this beach br br smell that you smell that lance what napalm son nothing in the world smells like that i love the smell of napalm in the morning you know one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours when it was all over i walked up we didn't find one of 'em not one stinkin' dink body the smell you know that gasoline smell the whole hill smelled like victory someday this war's gonna end
<START> this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 3
<START> an off beat but very delightful performance by john travolta sets off this very funny comedy his interpretation of the archangel is as a womanizing overweight ladies man and he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to chicago john hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for chicago tabloid owner bob hoskins angie macdowell plays role much as she did her role in four weddings and a funeral maureen stapleton is neat in a cameo her comment michael doesn't suffer fools is just one of many memorable moments bob hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect a little to off the wall mainly you're there to see michael take on a bull mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing
<START> a question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film who are the crazy people br br the answer become less clear as the film goes on br br renee zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and while her voice is still high she is incredibly effective as the shell shocked betty in fact she is so effective i almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable br br this is the first time ms zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task br br chris rock Â though as foul mouthed as usual Â is fairly subdued as wesley he is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed most br br there are some interesting allusions the first time you see betty she is dressed almost exactly like dorothy gale from the wizard of oz' Â then later in the film she is compared to dorothy when she says she has never been out of kansas before at one point the song that doris day was best known for sera is on the soundtrack and then later charlie morgan freeman describes her as having Âa whole doris day thing going on ' br br this is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast br br it has a surprising ending that as contrary as it sounds is actually fairly predictable br br if for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice morgan freeman
<START> co directed by and starring rutger hauer this film short was based on a short story by dutch writer harry br br in the 10 minutes of the film's length you will get to see a life time as 'harry' unravels his long time fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same room br br using black and white film the textures are accentuated in this delicate telling of a tale the voice of 'harry' drawing you into his world br br a subtle tight performance from rutger hauer and 2 non speaking characters wonderful soundtrack by dutch musician br br at the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on dvd region 2 liv ullman as a bonus track but is due to be on the re released dvd of the hitcher another tight but very different performance from hauer br br see this film if you can
<START> historical movies always take liberties conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences etc however historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history this film does not the only scene i actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night he confronts the dangerous intruder with i don't remember sending for room service the main entertainment value is in its badness i recommended my local video story put it on the turkeys shelf
<START> this was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's yes it is a rip off of goodfellas but as the saying goes good poets borrow great poets steal and pta has stolen brilliantly from some of the best plus added some genius touches of his own i gave this a ten which is very rare for me br br the main reason i am commenting on this though cause i could just rave all night is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue what are you thinking this deserves the full screen experience look at the ratio it was shot in i saw it 5 times at the cinema and haven't bothered to watch it on video br br nuff said
<START> honestly this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting heather graham could never live this down it has three titles for a reason to protect the guilty beautifully bad dialog do you like ribs and a plot only a mother could approve this is your friday night entertainment br br my roommate rented this under the title terrified because he liked heather graham but terrified is what we felt after the final credits not because the movie is scary but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel br br horrible movie there are a few no name actors that provide some unintentional comedy but nothing worth viewing heather graham's dramatic climax also was one of the most pathetic and disturbing things i have ever witnessed i award this movie no point and may god have mercy on its soul
