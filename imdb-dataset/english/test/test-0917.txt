<START> joe d'amato might have made some other notable movies in his very long and very prolific career prolific of course by turns of making very cheap z grade movies in italy's big exploitation boom of the late 70s early 70s but porno holocaust isn't one of them or at least shouldn't be granted i should not expect much from a movie with such a title but i thought considering the back of the description that it might have some fun horror scenes with the horny mutant cannibal zombie turns out the zombie doesn't appear until more than halfway into the movie and at every turn we get instead a tawdry sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine which is fine but it's not very enjoyable except in the most what the f is this bs kind of way there's laughable dialog involving lobsters costing more from mail order japan than in paris hot slim women play and who have particular sexual hang ups letting the door be unlocked to be raped and a bi polar kind of enjoyment out of getting gang banged br br it all leads up to the island where the main attraction is a guy who early on just spends an absolutely pathetic forget ludicrous amount of time just staring at the newcomers to the radioactive wasteland of the shot on caribbean island and once revealed has a face like one of the guards in jabba's palace and has a sweet potato for a main genital but much dumber than anything before it is the relationship that develops between the monster and a dark skinned lady who has an inordinate amount of time to escape but just sits there blank faced as the monster brings gifts and for what must be a racially motivated exploitation move on the part of the filmmakers the monster only rapes and kills the white women and not her and it ends of course with a happy ending i use quotes of course out of a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending at all br br bottom line this is not what you might expect as possibly being a bloody horror movie with plenty of tacky but cool looking italian monster zombies devouring human flesh if anything what violence is in the film is done on a shoe string a log hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath which is like the aftermath of a tomato hitting someone so really the last part of the title is meant more for market sake yet even as a porno movie it has little to go on except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the caribbean as an interview with george eastman suggests this was just one of a few quickies made while on the island its got penny bought schlocky camera work and similar actors filled with genitalia about 3 4 of the whole time and with wretched lip syncing and music like nino forced at gun point to make something snappy in a bordello and it's still a piece of celluloid dung all the same all of this could be an immense guilty pleasure but it isn't
<START> mockney comes to brighton despite a poor reception in the british press and state funded british cinema written all over it i rather hoped that we'd get a bit of the grimy hard nosed london by the sea of graham greene br br it doesn't even aspire to this characters straight out of their clone 'n crimp trailers reproduce guy ritchie's types the format looks more like a british tv series than a film brighton is a backdrop goldmine wasted with plastic studio work br br i watched this film in pursuit of a good performance from famke janssen she's a bit slick for this company her brand of big screen belonging more to blockbusters such as deep rising as for acting a role even the search continues circus is boring 3 10
<START> i don't want to write too much about the film but basically it's an action comedy with a little bit of romance thrown in about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become highway men together fantastic performance by robert and everybody else involved a brilliant who really makes you hate him some great comical lines actually laugh out loud amazing action and a great plot choice of music and ambiance all fantastic basically brilliantly directed and written i recommend this film to anyone who likes a good british movie or a good bit of action i don't know why the film never took off i thought it got no where near as much recognition as it deserved if for nothing else watch this film for one of the greatest finale's of all time not to give anything away but this one really get's the heart beating
<START> in an earlier comment i mentioned how much i enjoyed this film better second time around i don't from that opinion strangely i can't find anyone else who did like it br br my mother was going to see it but several friends told her no way my sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out part way through br br my wife's suggestion is that australians see the characters as just normal everyday americans and therefore it's not funny but hey most americans think all australians are like crocodile dundee so it's nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change
<START> for a film by a first time director this is a simply amazing little film though i have to admit that it's a bit hard to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it as the film takes a definite stand in favor of assisted suicide however what i loved about the film is that i had no idea this is what the film was about until the film was more than half complete and by then i was already hooked br br in addition to the excellent way the subject was introduced i was amazed at the very professional style of the film with some of the best cinematography i've ever seen in a short film plus this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film just beautiful br br as i said this is a controversial film i myself struggle with what i think about this debate but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way i really have to respect the team who made this film
<START> this film gave me probably the most pleasant surprise of any i've ever seen it was not a big budget production and its premise middle age amateur jazz musicians get an unexpected professional engagement at a catskills like resort seems rather modest what's not modest is the film's success this is a little slice of life movie that is most entertaining throughout director frank d gilroy also wrote the script and it's full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists br br the actors are journeymen who do a solid job the biggest revelation to me was cleavon little he plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for an ailing band member his attitude immediately clashes with the others while they see it as an opportunity for big fun and a once in a lifetime thing he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one this leads to conflict but when the group gets in trouble he steers them through little who died too young really showed me he was a fine actor with this film br br this movie is a true sleeper the kind that a film fan always hopes to discover i recommend it wholeheartedly
<START> a short review without any spoilers follows br br i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness i'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters br br roy new movie you the living is nothing less than a complete masterpiece you the living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera i will not give away the content of the scenes here because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details but yes most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed when the film was over we applauded for several minutes we had no other choice br br so what's the score with you the living hm isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions history guilt the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects and these themes work very well together br br the images created are brilliant the depth sometimes surpasses songs from the second floor br br well sorry for this ranting praising review look out for the flying house in the beginning folks br br 10 10 stars a masterpiece i never throw this grade out
<START> the phenomenon helge schneider defies easy description or quick yet for the international audience not acquainted to him one could say he's something like a crude mix of weird al yankovich and andy kaufman adding a foible for jazz music and 70s outfits while his stage performances already are eccentric his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous br br 00 schneider is in my opinion best movie he stars in the two leading roles police detective 00 schneider and murderer villain baxter and also in a precious smaller role as physician dr br br in the opening scene we see how modern art loving baxter accidentally kills the circus clown bratislav from whom he has bought a used jaguar when a beloved sculpture slips out of baxter's hands fatally hitting upon reading about the incident in the newspaper 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick lt who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name they pick up baxter's track quickly and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion one of the movie's best scenes but initially fail to gather any proof the story winds through many turns with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny such as a daydream by 00 including the most unusual view on a running man's brief clad crotch in movie history a police department party during which gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized and a visit at the already mentioned dr baxter then is finally caught attempting to escape to rio de janeiro on a plane br br always worth special mention is andreas who in this case plays 00's wife as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in movies br br so all you folks out there looking for new laughs i strongly recommend this movie the catch you have to understand german as i doubt there's an english version around
<START> i'd heard of the case but hadn't really paid attention during the whole hoopla of writing the book being arrested etc however this movie did an excellent job of detailing martha the brothers the murder mark involvement and the results of his investigation i especially liked the flashback scenes with martha talking about her last summer the actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real martha was probably like that it made martha seem like a real person rather than a victim i'd definitely recommend watching this
<START> i've read the positive comments on this movie i assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why i watched this whole movie but i don't think i laughed even once during the duration of this film the jokes were mostly very bad but when the jokes had some promise the delivery was off if you liked it maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left this movie had a poor script bad acting poor directing weak plot nothing of virtue and was not entertaining if you haven't seen this movie don't
<START> i enjoyed carax's les amants du pont and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard well the first 10 minutes were ok but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life a sad disappointment
<START> this film is bad not so bad it is good just bad it is however hilariously bad i watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other chuck norris film ever again if you have to choose between this film and death you should happily choose this film however as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making hence the hilarity br br it is a constant depression to me as i grind away at my desk job that some people get to be involved in movie making and decided to produce things such as this br br 1 out of 10 still better than starship troopers however
<START> given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible a drunkard a bad father a and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits any way i found the other male hero of the story captain a more endearing character the two female roles were played by actresses and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2 another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive that think that age old conventions can easily be surpassed the atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it's possible political outcomes i think one would recommend such a movie
<START> while its not the masterpiece that le samourai was i've accepted by now that jean pierre melville was never able to top that classic i find le rouge to be much better than bob le i felt that bob le was an above average and influential b film but still a b film le rouge proves that as a filmmaker melville improved as he continued john woo is a massive fan of melville even though their film making style differs while woo uses fast motion for shootouts and an operatic sense of violence melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well he wasn't interested in creating quickly paced action films but more meditative crime thrillers in that department he was one of the best br br le samourai is still his best work mainly because it has more character development than this but on a technical level they're probably equal besides while le samourai had one great lead performance this has four alain delon is once again an ultra cool gangster on the prowl this man's silence is fascinating is superb as the police inspector on the case of the heist and escaped con he steals every scene he is in and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor in france he is best known as a slapstick comedian in the mode of buster keaton yves montand is great also as the shaky and paranoid gun expert gian maria a regular in spaghetti westerns is overshadowed by his three co stars but still does an adequate job br br once again melville's direction is superb taking equal influence from both american crime thrillers and the french new wave the man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose this is more slowly paced than most caper flicks but it really pays off by the end le rouge is a bit short of being an absolute classic but is still one of the best heist flicks ever made tarantino must've seen this before making reservoir dogs 8 10
