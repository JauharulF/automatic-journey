<START> hulk hogan stars as a champion wrestler a real acting stretch named rip who is forced to defend his honor his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network because wrestling sells however when rip declines the network gets a circuit fighting championship called and i'm totally serious battle of the tough guys who's champion zeus played by tiny lister jr maybe the deadliest man alive rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital no holds barred is pretty much what i expected from vince mcmahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre hogan it is basically lots of unintentional humor tons of awkward sequences a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity in other words it's not unlike wrestling itself so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they're getting the movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this i myself found this to be ultimately hilarious they're are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself such as the way hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limo how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way hogan recites from his i e i'm not going to be around when this check clears no holds barred is a lot of fun true though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker br br out of 4 fair
<START> has a delightfully fresh script acted superbly by both young and old actors alike john doyle has done an excellent job bringing humour to a tragic true story keeping a sometimes sad story fun and engrossing particularly to those of us not familiar with the events of south east asia during ww2 br br john doyle's parallel story line successfully bridges the gap between past and present allowing the audience insight into the long term effect war had on the prisoners and their family's lives as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which nicely rounds out the tales both individual and collective doyle deserves praise for this effort we have in the past been delighted by his abundant and quick witted humour as evidenced in his long running collaboration with greg as roy h g ' br br as the series is approaching half way we are looking forward to how the story develops with anticipation
<START> one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me br br the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word br br it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to many aryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and more so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away br br i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance oz doesn't mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldn't say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing thats if you can get in touch with your darker side
<START> spoilers follow and i haven't even seen it br br let me guess the murder is related to the evil property developer wanting to develop the riverside and dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar dastardly plot if anybody who's seen it could let me know if i'm half right you'll have saved me the time it might take to watch something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to steer clear of both this film and its enthusiastic reviewers on the other hand it sounds intriguing but if it was any good would it really be given away with a sunday rag and what sort of track record does foley have anyway br br so as a public service i managed to sit through it it's worse than 'swept away' really i've read stories by eight year olds with more drama than this truly awful and i was half right
<START> i just watched congo on dvd in most cases i love these kind of movies but this one is different it made me write my first comment for a movie on imdb i was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result you can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script and as a producer frank marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch he never should have tried to become another spielberg this one shows how hard it is to make a good movie maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen if can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one if you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind
<START> this was a great movie and safe for the entire family which one doesn't see much of anymore my wife and i and 15 year old son loved it even though you had an inkling of how it would end it continued to be a fun journey and the final ending surprised us there should be more movies like this
<START> this was one of the worst films i can remember seeing i am sure i have seen worse though if that me slamming it br br the humor isn't funny there are stupid stereotype jokes that again aren't funny i was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film it was a complete waste of time i enjoyed martin in earlier films but not this one same for queen latifah she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too but this role was horrid br br i mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script i feel strongly you can't save a formulaic unfunny script with decent actors this movie as a case in point still all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film i am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted made released theatrically and promoted
<START> unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph as a child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wanna be tough redneck played to perfection by brad although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to river raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity
<START> first of all it is sheer joy to hear the legend perform such wonderful and timeless music this movie and soundtrack is a tour de force ray charles is unique and amazing i truly adored the film as it was inspiring and entertaining throughout br br jamie foxx has become one of the premiere actors in hollywood as is clearly shown in ray and he should get an oscar for this role it is unprecedented in fact everyone who worked on this film should receive accolades i really liked kerry washington who played the exceptional wife ray charles obviously married well regina king is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary sharon warren who plays a struggling young mother br br in all honesty i'd say this whole project was arranged the entire cast was perfect great screenplay and awesome settings major props to the director taylor and crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of ray charles to the screen so flawlessly this is my picture of the year certainly one of the best biographical films ever made
<START> its a space flick or at least i think it is you got half naked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters its friggin hilarious the acting is so bad that space nuts looks like an emmy award winning film the story is simple space prisoner gets chance to reduce sentence by investigating a space station that lost contact with humanity she finds a doctor experimenting with women and a angry of alien she fights them so on and so forth its a movie worth seeing it just to wet your pants with laughter if you like real sci fi flicks its a no no but its a great mood setter for the amateur film maker because i can guarantee their film is better than this
<START> wow this film was terrible it is as simple as that it is actually the first time that i walked out early as far as i can remember this turned out okay though i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a movie br br where to start bad acting bad jokes humour which i simply cannot stand sorry but snot pee and scat are not funny you have seen the title picture that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes with the two heroes hitting and mutilating each other which is supposed to be humorous all by itself it is not br br apart from body fluids violence and cross dressing i do not remember much about this at least not much good i was really really disappointed by this piece of garbage or let us be honest here given that i am actually a big fan of british i e black humour i was angry br br so want my advice three words do not watch
<START> this is a classic b type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see it started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller but i was mistaking all movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller but that doesn't happen it runs slowly and peacefully til the end with nothing interesting in it just the ending was unexpected and original but that's it vote 2 5 out of 10 oh one more thing why is this movie rated r anyway
<START> it seems that all companies that are enjoy with the taxes taken by romania for picture grant the image that disappear since 1994 they are hardly try to get the oldest car the had founded but they never take pictures of the ferrari aston martin and all new mercedes that are more the you can find in some important countries br br a second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in bucharest where they had the possibility of clear the streets and put garbages on dressing people with i don't know maybe '90 clothes a making them seem so stupid that you will realize the script was maybe a second hand bought from ebay or worth br br i for future to keep making movies in us and to make good money there than to give us a little bit and shame our country i have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message beyond my english sorry
<START> talk about a bore snore this 3rd rate biker film was putting me to sleep as soon as the opening credits came on the screen the shame is that the cast included many fine actors among them george kennedy karen black leo gordon richard lynch lance henriksen and william forsythe br br a take off of the western classic high noon this is basically the story of a former u s army green beret henriksen trying to get someone to help him rid a one horse town of a gang of creepy bikers br br everyone tries but the script is on grade school level sad to see academy award winner kennedy in such a comedown from his out standing performance in cool hand luke br br if you have trouble sleeping at night this would be a perfect movie video to rent you'll be sleeping in no time
<START> moscow zero stole my money and i want it back this is a horror movie not thriller not suspense a horror movie yes this movie is a horror horrifyingly bad after many years of lurking here at imdb i am actually moved to set up an account just so i like at least one other reviewer here can warn people do not watch this movie it will steal your soul or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button br br seriously i'd love to hear the director's voice over on an enhanced dvd there's another horrifying thought to see what the hell they were thinking the producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the val kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution br br i actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand which provided no subtitles to the russian dialog not that it mattered much straining to hear the russian translate it in your head if you can only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury br br i will give this movie a 1 because i cannot give it a lower rating and because it did achieve one remarkable thing it somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie not feel claustrophobic now that's a dubious achievement br br here's your spoiler and the ending holy mother no pun intended it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming the climax of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape i have ever seen on film exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this the off button
