<START> a possible minor spoiler the first jurassic park was an effective but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good the sequel the lost world had a few decent moments but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a t rex running amok in san diego now in jurassic park iii what little story there was in the first one and the sequel has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non stop action which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done br br sam neill is back as dr grant who is given a proposition by a couple william h macy tea leoni to come with them to an island to help them find their son who's been lost for over 2 months but of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them br br this one was obviously intended as a thrill ride with no real story whatsoever but even on that level the movie doesn't deliver director joe johnston jumanji somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the jurassic movies and squeeze the life right out of it br br the dinos look okay though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary the bottom line is it's not a very good film even as a thrill ride out of 4 stars
<START> i won't spoil it for you although you probably could care less if it was spoiled you'll know what i mean after you watch it poor story b rated movie quality typical horror stupid situations rare timing i should of known when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add quotes just tells me that the movie bombed big time and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner but i kept getting let down i don't usually waste my time adding comments to any movie in fact this is my second post i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it
<START> no one expects the star trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie including the goofy scenes with kirk spock and mccoy at yosemite br br i would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it even the cable channels avoid this movie
<START> as well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story fire is also a comic satire of middle class indian culture i find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie these two genres i e deep meaningful alternative love story and comic satire usually mix together just as well as oil and water do but mehta somehow manages to achieve the balance to near perfection the servant behaviour the family's treatment of him the bedridden grandmother's constant inescapable presence obsession with a teachings coming from a culture much like india's these are things i can immediately identify as being typical they have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed while developing her primary subject matter mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully in fact much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary the film flows from the comic to the serious with great br br all in all brilliant use of symbolic devices radha compared to sita of legend and coming out of fire unscathed and therefore pure the lifelong desire of the young radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom kudos to shabana azmi radha the lighting crew and deepa mehta their very un hollywood like and un bollywood like talents made this movie special one criticism the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well br br the verdict 9 on 10 nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind
<START> here's a spoof that's guaranteed to entertain folks in the iq range of homer simpson it's a cheap shot at every great superhero notably spiderman and batman but it doesn't end there it gets progressively worse until it disintegrates into a pathetic ensemble of slapstick by the truckload br br for those interested in the plot you've only to watch spiderman while under the influence of some heavy narcotic what you get is dragonfly man Â a boy wonder who loves the girl next door suddenly inheriting some stupendous super powers br br the rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth but don't' take my word for it for kids this is somewhat amusing for adults it's a great film to drop the kids off for
<START> i was at the world premier of this movie and have even met todd a couples times around town once at olive garden todd isn't a bad guy he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams br br as for the movie it is good if you like zombie films with very little plot and lots of blood and guts you get to see some kansas city locations and lots of raw meat what could be better look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies with just a change of clothes or hats you can have a good drinking game with this movie take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt
<START> certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics which is one reason you should never pay attention to them this film is a perfect example the critics like director eric rohmer br br this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager pauline she's taking care of for the summer and the relationships they have with a few men it's talk talk talk and more talk br br for those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play a friend of mine loaned me this tape he thought he was getting some sexy french film and was disappointed i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring br br how this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable
<START> ed wood rides again the fact that this movie was made should give any young br br aspiring film maker hope any screenplay you might have thought of using to br br line a or a birdcage should now not seem that bad do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids watching this br br movie made me realize that boa vs python was not that bad after all it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film it is understandable why this director has so many aliases there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to br br make your toward your tv set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it
<START> i think not i mean yeah if you compare this film to the godfather or maybe a little older film like casablanca or maybe even a little newer film like the english patient it doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie or does it i think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great oscar winning films you should never do that which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie in the categories best picture best actor in a leading role and best actress in a supporting role this film really deserved all of them the magnificent dustin hoffman gives us once again one of his best performances a couple of times in this movie i forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real i have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful so dustin hoffman passes the test with flying colors in my opinion there are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best katherine hepburn meryl streep jane fonda and ingrid bergman i can't help it i think she's great meryl streep even though she's in a supporting role is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real wow that's all i can say justin henry was great considering his age his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful so i say good job to cute little justin henry br br while i was watching this film for like the third time alone i couldn't stop crying i tried but i couldn't thank god i was alone this is probably the purest film i have ever seen other films that were nominated for best picture was apocalypse now norma rae breaking away and all that jazz i'm ashamed cause i haven't seen any of them but from what i've heard apocalypse now is great but when i heard about norma rae i only thought of sally field i think that considering the other nominees this film deserved it's five oscars and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future just like it has for the past 28 years good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget br br thanks for your time
<START> this is for different reasons a very very bad action movie first of all seagal is terribly out of shape he looks old and fat plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement secondly his opponent is a very weak villain this is about a smart and mean and chestnut does not deliver so what about the action well the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the alcatraz jail they shoot wild and bad because compared to the amount of required ammunition the bodycount is rather low there is nothing to save this movie there is not a single good line and not a single good joke the little psychological interlude with one and judge mcpherson is ridiculous so what does it have well the usual bell helicopters silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion doors riddled with bullets and 1000 watt lights shining through the holes characters jumping through the air while shooting loads of weapons coming from nowhere a long black coat containing a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold the pain continues to the very last take a hopeless approach to lighten up the closing credits californian don michael paul was writing and directing at least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind
<START> the movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography except for a couple of brief special effects reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv's early years nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his mood swings kills her and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan he wasn't very versatile watching him essay comedy is almost painful but no one was better at wounded idealism on dangerous ground or the psychic pain of this movie few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure br br lupino's problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape it's a nail biter all the way this is not one of lupino's many fine soulful parts that she was so good at instead it's a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting ryan's already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive looking ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality sensing trouble ryan abruptly fends her off finesse is not his strong suit insulted whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work women's work that does it up to that point he's been courteous and professional with lupino trying to set himself on a normal path but whiting has hit his raw nerve now there's heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door leaving lupino to pay the price it's a riveting scene expertly done br br anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black and whites in favor of wide screen spectacles too bad what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front she deserves at least an honorary oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much
<START> captain willard martin sheen has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to assassinate colonel kurtz marlon brando as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders and since kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for capt willard to understand how col kurtz could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why but what will he decide to do once he finds him br br any movie that can start out with the doors' the end is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song apocalypse now does this perfectly i can't think of anything better for it to be set to the vietnam war and the insanity in the minds that it created an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the jungle in vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder through it's use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here br br an overall great cast with the exception of laurence fishburne of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread i just don't like fishburne ever since i found out he was cowboy curtis in peewee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold i realize the pettiness of this but i simply do not care we need to sick gary oldman on him brando is excellent as col kurtz and i can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence sheen is also fun to watch as willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie has to be robert duvall's lt colonel before this film i never pictured duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date he simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gung ho air cavalry commander who loves to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i also love the smell of napalm in the morning br br the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on willard's mission is to kill kurtz plain and simple but it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself in the redux version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey i don't feel they take away anything though it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it in fact that's the entire point on top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like to go completely mad br br a big war movie lover this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter all of them classics i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what i've said all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam war so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless even if after having most recently view an i think it's a tad better in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given as a fellow reviewer has previously stated an is one of the most ambitious films ever made
<START> the reason why this movie isn't any better known and more appreciated to me seems because of its subject because of its controversial subject this movie never got a proper big release and still remains a fairly unknown one to this very day not that it's subject is that controversial now anymore though br br basically in essence it's a movie about a white man befriending a black man the friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic but the way it gets portrayed in this movie makes it all feel very real we see these different mingle in with each other as if it's just completely normal unfortunately of course back in those days it really wasn't regarded as anything normal seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been an hard thing to watch for instance for some proportions of its 1957 audience br br you can really understand why sidney poitier has always been and still is being respected so much by the hollywood society and the black community in general of course it's one of the reasons why he also received an honorary award at the oscar's in 2002 in his movies he often fights against discrimination and prejudiced issues with of course in the heat of the night as the best example of this a real role model that certainly has inspired many afro american actors to this very day but on top of that he also was a great actor yes he is still alive but he has pretty much retired completely from movies now it seems since his last credited role is from 2001 br br this movie was martin directorial debut and he also wasn't given too much movie to spend on his movie the studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of its concept and or because it was first movie or perhaps it was simply due to the fact that mgm just wasn't that big anymore and it had left its best days behind them ever since the '50's on metro goldwyn mayer sort of had the reputation of making not too great and cheap movies while in the early years before that it was really one of the biggest studios with lots of stars and acclaimed directors attached to it who made many award winning classic movies luckily for them their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the mgm logo appears at a movie people are no longer expecting a lesser movie anymore br br anyway even with its restrained budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one the movie is very simple with only a few characters and a simplistic plot in it the movie however still manages to capture you with its story and subjects without ever starting to become preachy or anything about it it makes the movie an effective one as well with its subjects br br really a movie that deserves to be seen br br 8 10
<START> this show is amazing i love each and every episode carrie is a spitfire and doug is a lovable and at times a moron arthur spence danny deacon and carrie's boss add just a nice end touch to the show tying up all of the funny pee in your pants moments in one of the seasons doug tries to get carrie drunk because she is nicer when she is drunk nice husband right carrie isn't much better when her boss needs a ips driver to testify in a small case at her job carrie hesitates because she views doug as a slob and doesn't want him to embarrass her so she hires friend instead wife of the year but who i believe to be funniest is yell at random arthur he is drop dead hilarious and angry hey you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy this show is hilarious and if you haven't seen it yet then you haven't lived
<START> quite simply goldeneye is the single greatest n64 game to date the learning curve is just about perfect and you'll still be playing it with your friends months on as the multiplayer mode is nothing short of exceptional br br the system for acquiring cheats for once requires some degree of skill rather than simply knowing which buttons to press and the challenge of aztec on 00 agent level is astonishing br br all in all it's the best game i've ever played on the n64
