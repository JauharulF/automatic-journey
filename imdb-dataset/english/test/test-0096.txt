<START> started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all the scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off glad i didn't pay to see it didn't laugh or even smile once there seems to be a strange tendency for americans to classify their films as 'comedy' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha i have finally learned to avoid what americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny now it looks like i will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in america i don't understand why america can produce amazingly funny comedies like two and a half men will and grace king of queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour this film wasn't gross or anything but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn
<START> this film grabs you from the opening scenes and never lets go you watch indulgently upon viewing janos excitement over coming to america he's a likable fellow you cannot help being fond of him even when his eagerness is replaced by bitterness as his fortunes turn you know that in his circumstances you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive this movie comments on society's worship of beauty and all things superficial and is only more true in the culture of the twenty first century janos himself becomes victim to this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend you're young and beautiful if you could see you would have the world and like many a modern gangster movie when her safety is threatened he extracts a powerful revenge his innocence is not altogether lost however for he demands an equally high price of himself knowing he deserves his fate br br peter lorre is in fine form in this starring role only a few actors could convincingly accomplish this character's transformation from innocent to embittered criminal in sixty nine minutes lorre is well supported by all the cast making this a real ensemble picture and not just a vehicle for one star with a bit less preachy dialogue this movie would be a 10 highly recommended
<START> br br fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace and far more entertaining if you ask me hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days i hate to describe it too much it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots the princess anne droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair and fluke is even more of a dork than his original if that's possible ernie is one crazy son of a buck he's also the source of now the apocalypse now spoof
<START> mainly a biography of a lustful doctor robert robert downey who has his way in the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half mainly katharine meg ryan br br the good fantastic set decoration i e the lush king's palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting support br br the bad after 50 60 minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some badly needed restoration shall we say the film may look nice but it's a long two hours to sit through too long
<START> lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers both boys around 30 living at home with absolutely nothing going for them i live in the midwest and i can't name one family like this i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor now i realize i need to have a agent to that humor to make it work the acting and camera work and editing was fine the first 15 minutes got you set and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end and we watched the entire movie the male family members as expected simply walked out after the first 30 minutes
<START> i broke my own rule buying this movie from the 5 88 bin at walmart basically if a movie has a big star in it and you've never heard of it before it's usually for a reason well in the case of this movie the reason is because it sucked they plaster sandra bullock's photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait and it reeled this little right on in i was thinking of donating the disc to charity or giving it to the library but i don't think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie worst lines what do you mean army buddies what do you mean your dad
<START> this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen br br i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism but this is supposed based upon a true character br br our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father he also has a doll fetish but i cannot figure out where that came from his co workers find out and tease him terribly br br during the day a mild manner accountant and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls they are all attractive of course else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist he graduates eventually to actually killing and that is what gets him caught br br like i said a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood
<START> this show is perhaps one of the most boring most unfunny shows i've ever seen while the humour was subtle and i'm all for the subtle humour the jokes just weren't funny br br the show is about two in their mid thirties living in new york trying to start their music careers br br i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other kiwi behind during a mugging okay the plot idea has potential but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler and the other half was actually important to the story br br what i mean is they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy i've got one piece of advice for the writers mention it once for the idiots who can't figure it out by the way he's acting and move on br br and i found the characters were annoying the character who left the other behind brett came across as being overly innocent and naive the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voice br br a third character who was the band manager was obviously incompetent but he was the one character that i liked he's also the one that earned the show a one star rating br br all in all a show i have no intention of ever watching again
<START> not only unique for its time but one of the greatest science fiction films of all time made without cgi on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures stanley kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has stanley kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in history thus far br br this film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb br br stanley kubrick and the great c clarke collaborated to write this time less classic br br aliens a special message on earth at the dawn of human kind and one on the moon which modern man finds br br finally humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway br br any one who studied film and or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film br br if you don't like it then you belong to bollywood or your a true aussie
<START> spoiler ahead br br i suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for tv movie but this one was especially bad the plot was a good idea but badly done the acting wasn't especially good and the ending of the film was just terrible the main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath it's completely pathetic br br there is only one reason really to watch this film yasmin bleeth although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before don't bother even watching this waste of time if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch drop dead gorgeous instead it's only an infinite number of times better
<START> this is the classic western the good glenn ford the dashing hero the ex soldier the man who would not hold a gun again he eventually has to stand up the the evil land baron edward g robinson who owns most of the valley and wants it all then there's barbara stanwyck the real ruler of the roost edward g robinson's wife who will allow no one to get in her way even making edward g robinson look weak she is so evil that everyone else pales next to her blind ambition and ruthlessness to rule the valley and everyone in it the gleam in her eye as she sees people face death for her is unnerving it is worth waiting for throw in a young brian keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own with the requisite shoot outs ambushes and close ups of hard riding cowboys and you have a heck of a western without giving anything away there are enough twists and turns within to make this not just a standard cowboy shoot em up
<START> broken silence or race against fear 1998 starring ariana richards william susan blakely tracy ellis ross scott marissa ken david bruce dawson director joseph screenplay sara jean phyllis murphy br br this is another lifetime channel film made exclusively for television released in 1998 directed by long time tv series director joseph l inspired by true events it's a lot like the majority of lifetime movies a cautionary tale for women raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family a mother father wife husband and mentor teacher in this case track coach the young and little known actress ariana richards she played the small girl in jurassic park delivers a highly convincing performance as high school track athlete mickey carlyle who is raped by her coach kurt william and must suffer in silence as no one believes her story except for of course her own mother susan blakely together mother and daughter fight to put kurt behind bars the film drags on quite a bit is ultimately predictable at times far too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself but is genuinely powerful in the end ariana richards' performance is of the daytime soap kind but she is the strongest in the entire cast her facial expressions body language and overall acting is realistic in terms of how she as an aspiring athlete idolizes her coach is in turn violated by him and must now live with the shame trauma and further fight him in court william plays the part with a nasty sort of duplicity though he is far from subtle he has abused other star athletes before who have remained silent and made it to the top and appears outwardly innocent william a lesser known actors like the others has has never done a role like this but but he does a believable and strong performance overall it's especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy lead actor in everything else he does including some lesser known films and on the soap opera guiding light the only real problem i had with this film is the manner in which the film is structured as the film opens we watch coach about to rape mickey letting us know right away that this guy is no good but this makes for weak character development and story if the first scene had instead been the sequence with the opening credits in which we see mickey running jogging in the city across a lake we would have better character development because we don't know that coach while seemingly interested in the success of his star athlete is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen mickey a person whom she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realizes she was wrong about him director joseph is no stranger to drama for tv knott's landing star trek quantum leap the outer limits lois and clark earth final conflict and movies like la femme in 1996 had directed another lifetime movie similar to this stand against fear 1996 he manages to convey the gravity of the event we are genuinely disturbed by the coach lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student these scenes are graphic and ought to be viewed by mature audiences but its message is clear sexual predators and rapists are not always a stranger and can assume different forms and their preying grounds can even include a high school this film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that rapists will cause no further harm to others despite other negative reviews this film does a great job in expressing its message and ought to be given to mothers daughters high school students including both male and female as bad as rape is staying silent when it happens is even worse
<START> pretty br br pretty actresses and actors pretty bad script pretty frequent let's strip to our undies scenes pretty fair f x pretty jarring location decisions the college dorm room looks like a high end hotel room probably because it was shot at a hotel pretty bland storyline pretty awful dialog pretty locations pretty annoying editing unless you like the music video flash cut style br br this one isn't a guilty pleasure this is more an embarrassing one if you must watch this pick a good dance techno album and turn the sound off on the movie you'll see the pretty people in their pretty black undies and probably follow the story just fine br br the cast may be able to act i doubt that anyone could look skilled given the lines plot that they had to deal with
<START> richard 1991 documentary about gary cooper gary cooper american life american legend gives us a look at the tremendous all american star through his films and his life narrated by clint eastwood the theme is definitely gary american as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns and scenes from meet john doe mr deeds goes to town and sgt york the best part of the documentary is the home movies of cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life there is also a hilarious clip of cooper on the jack benny show doing the comeback on the number bird dog and benny loses it the documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with patricia neal which nearly ruined both their lives br br there's a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio retrospective it jumps around a lot and has no footage of cooper being interviewed which would have added a lot also clint eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive what it was was boring and monotone given that cooper himself tended to be the strong silent type on screen we could have used a little animation br br on a personal note gary cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived there were some looks at him in his early films but not nearly enough for this fan that smile those lips that bone structure he was handsome throughout his life but in films like morocco and desire he is devastating instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances as howard in the fountainhead giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand a young suave cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch this documentary alas was definitely produced by a man
<START> this is a bizarre oddity directed by the guy who edited the texas chainsaw massacre chuck gives a hilariously over the top performance as the owner of a roadside wax museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near the wax figures look so real one of the teen's points out heh heh heh not so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned house of wax style terror i can think of many many horror films that are worse than this one
