<START> this movie is a real thriller it was exciting from shortly after the start till the very end if you are a real suspense nut this is the movie for you the characters were very well developed and the scenery was beautiful the story was very well written similar to some others i have seen but quite different in several ways a must see
<START> gypsy is possibly the greatest musical ever written so it's too bad that it's film version was such a disappointment to make up for that we have this re make which if not flawless is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical the script is completely accurate all the songs included and the staging remains close to the original jerome robbins' staging bette midler is a deft choice for rose her singing and personality merman esquire and her acting splendid peter reigert is a fine if not a great singer and cynthia is a straight forward natural louise in truth a live taping of the 1989 revival with tyne daly might have been a better idea if only because gypsy is simply more exciting on stage but this film is a fine translation of a great musical
<START> engaging entry from europe about czech fighter pilots flying for the raf during ww2 it's always interesting as an american to see a new point of view on familiar events in history there's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative still it is compelling all the way through there is a good balance between drama romance humor action and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast this is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring hollywood epics like pearl harbor a solid production all around this is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema
<START> well the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended
<START> this sequel is quite awful to be honest i'm a fan of kung fu movies and this is by far the worst i've seen bride with white hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment 1 was brilliant in some ways with an unique odd ball evil bad guy br br the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie instead the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen clans but there's no antagonist in this movie so the revenge is mute br br the worst part to this movie is the kung fu or lack there of they literally had a street style knife fight the character at the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography
<START> maybe we aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here i have a database of all the dvds i own including those received as gifts which this was and so when entering a new one i always refer to imdb for such info as genre runtime director leads etc when entering this i noted that it was a comedy and so i decided to watch it at a time when i wanted something light and a good laugh well it was neither there were absolutely no laughs at all and an inordinate amount of gratuitous profanity are there really radio announcers allowed to broadcast the sort of filth that steve jones dishes out what if a decent child happened to tune to his station br br rather than enjoy a good laugh or even a little giggle i found the whole thing thoroughly depressing i have given it 3 out of 10 but to be honest i don't know what those 3 are for i suppose the basics of lighting and sound weren't too bad br br we have an ostensibly stone broke loser giovanni ribisi who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car who pays for the fuel and live in what could be a nice apartment who pays his rent given the opportunity of forming what might have been some sort of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl he even blew that perhaps it was she lynn collins who earned this movie the 3 points the fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense i make as much in one night doing this as i do in two weeks' hairdressing br br unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth forget it
<START> i just watched this movie at the santo domingo international film festival while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story before a movie with ray liotta but i can't remember much of it of course this one is a lot more dramatic especially at the end br br this is the story life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain after 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife son and all the people he knows the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go br br watching emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing the affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesn't despite that the movie is still funny exiting and involving either it makes you want to help emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him i liked the analogies photography and the good performances br br 7 5 out of 10
<START> but then again what ever is i picked this up at my local store for you guessed it 99 cents plus tax i remember seeing this on video as a teen and thinking it was a cool flick too bad the film and my memories don't match regardless its not a too horrible way to blow a couple hours and it is neat to see some vintage bill paxton and mark hamill blah blah blah man oh man i cannot think of anything else to say about this flick just filling space to meet the ten line rule good golly this is pathetic just how bad is this movie that the best i could come up with in regards to it were five of text so anyway ten lines of text eh hmmm ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember squat about a film you just watched
<START> i bought this film on dvd despite the stale review and that was idiotic that review was completely accurate and i have never seen any worse erotic film in my long life even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings plus a nice cover but my own extreme erotica c films are over 100 times more erotic just in the soft delicious aspect with probably less than 100 times of this films budget the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book or any new exciting element of slave training except some very strange and sad developments then did the main male character klaus kinski not look a bit like the second master of o he try to play and not even lovely arielle dombasle did look delicious in any scene
<START> this movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me wanna scream lame nicholas write the movie yes man but direct this maybe he should stick with writing br br i am so disappointed because i heard all the great review i was expecting something like knocked up they say this is from the maker of knocked up why can't i see the resemblance but this just felt like a shallow overdone theme kind of movie for me i am so disappointed actually it's not bad if you consider it as your average chick movie but that character of the band guy just get on my nerves br br maybe i was just not paying enough attention to the movie but yeah they have some funny lines and scene but i don't felt the originality and the ending make the movie a little bit better at least the ending is not some boring clichÃ© one
<START> this is one of the best movies i have ever seen br br it's so full of details and every time you see it you'll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they can't do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there aren't br br i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever br br i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skit so the machinist secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them
<START> the piano teacher is all about huppert's character a middle aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which lurks a powerfully compelling aberrant personality unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study the film follows the huppert character through the term of her anguished relationship with a pupil delivering superb performances in the process not for everyone the piano teacher will play best with those into foreign films and character driven dramas dealing with dark issues a
<START> i seriously donÂ´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released sure itÂ´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies i seriously donÂ´t think that the people who hated gate really understood it gate in its uncut form much like the deer hunter shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life like the immigrants and in wyoming and living in comfort and privilege like the settled americans in wyoming and in the prologue and epilogue living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life leads in the epilogue also as michael cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate it is fascinating as a document of and maybe indictment of american life in old west wyoming the dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional combined with great music and cinematography the movie works like a truly poetic work of art granted gate with its refusal to patronize the viewer is not for all tastes however hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster that gate and cimino really do deserve more respect all people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind br br
<START> sit back and let director lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of india when was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie this movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in india if you didn't want to visit india before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now this movie has dancing girls a chase scene and the mafioso involved but it has a lot more thanks for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale i loved the ending we women don't want illusions in life we want reality p s i was friend at the film festival and met you briefly good luck with your distribution efforts and i'm talking up the movie a storm
<START> after watching waco the rules of engagement i was just sitting in disbelief of what i was witness to a big cover up by the fbi a massacre by gung ho trigger happy government agents i clearly remember the waco standoff i was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on cnn i remembered reflecting about all the children as i watched the mount camel compound burn in april 1993 i remember feeling sorry for the children but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader david and the other davidians film shows clearly and beyond doubt even though it is biased that the fbi lied over and over again i think that this film was a big contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in 1999 the outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the davidians presented i was very disappointed about the verdict because as far as i know it didn't take into account all the lying misinformation and evidence cover up by the fbi and other officials why have no one be prosecuted for hampering the work of the texas rangers investigators why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and the compound shortly after the incident these are questions that i haven't been given answers to by the government most importantly what about the children in this new investigation i haven't been informed about who was responsible for spraying the cs flammable tear gas into a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and i haven't found any answer to whether the children's muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas while they were alive if they did i would surely think that the janet reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass homicide or manslaughter the question that was raised by but not mentioned is was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent a plan that would have been accomplished with 112 or were the officials in charge so incompetent that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions both are equally frightening even if the davidians set fire to the compound the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job if the officials in charge knew as they claimed that the davidians would set fire to the compound why the did the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it into a furnace and why didn't they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would occur dark questions that still won't go away the final and most relevant issue of this film is the way that the davidians are demonized by the government through the media who just feeds it in to the public i clearly remember the resentment i felt for the evil davidians that i saw on cnn in 1993 now that i'm older i can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they are gearing up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended targets demonizing people with words like they have different unlawful values then us they don't enjoy freedom and they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life makes them so much easier to
