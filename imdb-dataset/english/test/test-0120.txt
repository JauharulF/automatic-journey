<START> i am a big gone with the wind nut but i was disappointed that both gone with the wind the movie and scarlett the mini series are so different from the books gone with the wind left so many things out in the movie that were in the book and they did the same with scarlett both were good movies but i really liked both books better there were so many characters left out of scarlett and the ages of some characters didn't seem to match up with the book the time lines don't match up either scarlett realizes she is pregnant on the ship to ireland in the book but she realizes it when she is throwing up while in also sally is made out to be an ugly monkey like woman in the book and the movie casted jean smart to play her who is obviously not an ugly woman over all scarlett is a good movie and it helps anyone who was disappointed in the way gone with the wind ended to see what might have happened if margaret mitchell had lived to write a sequel herself
<START> this is an important historical film since it was the the first all talking feature film br br the film was made for a mere 23 000 dollars br br it grossed over a million dollars upon its release br br this film all so helped define the gangster melodramas that were to become the bread and butter of the warner's studio in the 1930's br br the popularity of this film ended the silent era more so than its more famous part talkie predecessor the jazz singer the film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote br br the only actor who might be remember today that is in it was eugene palette
<START> i want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie the acting was horrific i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d'onofrio i will never look at them the same again keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise everyone knows they never could act thankfully only dan attempted an accent his accent was a disaster as expected i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read
<START> first of all i just wanna say that i'm a very big naruto fan i love the anime and the manga stories also the first movie just confirmed that naruto is all about great fun great action great story but then came the 2nd movie i was very hyped because the first movie turned out great but it didn't satisfy me one bit the story was lame action wasn't all that great especially compared to the anime series same goes for the quality of animation i found it very poorly could the story get any lamer any where's the of naruto not once does he turn demon i mean come on my advice is see the series until episode 140 then it's just fillers and then read the manga because that's still great ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future br br all and all i gave it a 4 just because it's naruto
<START> while i have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the russian revolution such as potemkin and ten days that shook the world i did not particularly enjoy this one this was mostly due to the annoying and artsy way that the director chose to shoot the film while potemkin excelled in its editing style this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse in some places the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish plus and this was truly annoying the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over the top what i mean by zombies is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the ukranian peasants were the people stand like mannequins in many scenes and they stand like this unmoving for a very long period of time while the evil capitalists and of the masses walk by gimme a break this movie is a wonderful example of style over substance and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction br br by the way the dvd for this film is improved somewhat if you leave the audio commentary on this makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights
<START> a film for mature educated audiences br br i saw random hearts in an advance screening shortly before its north american release this romantic drama was quite a treat i'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise but the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor br br all time box office draw harrison ford star wars raiders of the lost ark the fugitive air force one patriot games is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate internal affairs officer dutch ford's very subdued nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss betrayal this is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for harrison ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters next year harrison ford returns to action first for director robert zemeckis forrest gump back to the future in his summer 2000 thriller what lies beneath and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of tom the sum of all fears will be harrison ford's third outing as cia operative jack ryan br br director sydney pollack out of africa the firm tootsie has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to scott thomas' congresswoman it's a very sharp energetic portrayal for pollack not only is sydney pollack a gifted director he is also one of the most believable natural and charming actors around see eyes wide shut as well br br kristin scott thomas the english patient the horse whisperer shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy this is one of her better films and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite ford's quiet man toughness br br the subplots work wonderfully especially the subplot involving ford's character's investigation into police corruption look for a chilling effective turn by heat actor dennis haysbert who plays detective george the obstacle to overcome in investigation into police corruption br br the rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight charles s dutton whose long overdue for a film leading role goes to show that he is one of the best character actors around and bonnie hunt who i find extremely solid in this production steals most of her scenes with that wonderful charming smile as wendy judd br br the technical side of pollack's thriller is top from dave pollack's the firm perfectly surreal feeling jazzy score to philippe rousselot a river runs through it crisp photography to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh despite the film's unfortunate downer premise br br i highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery well paced plot character driven stories and romance all rolled into one this is a terrific story about betrayal forgiveness it also features one of the most surprising yet poignant and certain to be controversial endings for a harrison ford film in recent times random hearts is definitely one of the better films of the year br br 1 2 out of or 8 5 out of 10 0
<START> this movie is beyond horrible avoid at all costs i want my hour and 20 minutes back br br not funny at all you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once swears spill out of the speakers like a waterfall each one getting more annoying as the last and not contributing to the comedy or plot general comedy not this movie in general br br all in all its a lame a 5 watered down typed out cold ish movie but tremendously awful the movie focuses around two groups of a city and how obviously dumb is that where the two opposites have battles with each other story is much like a 4 year old's bed time story without all the swears and stupid jokes br br movie 1 10 because you can't give any lower scores
<START> the book of life was rather like a short snack the appetite for hartley's next full length movie br br this movie doesn't need to be seen on the big screen watch it with a few friends who are hal hartley or wayne wang fans or better still try to convert some newbies
<START> essentially this is a dreadful film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you depending on how much you want them to in opening up the red green show for the big screen the filmmakers jettisoned the rustic charm carefully honed over a decade's worth of episodes set in and around lodge in favor of a blandly photographed road movie with a ghastly faux hollywood big musical score and profoundly boring storyline that's not embellished with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the tv series br br having devised a plotline that keeps most of the members of lodge offscreen for most of the film and requires virtually everyone concerned to be despicably mean to the loveable harold who's the hero of the film the usually crusty red being relegated in this incarnation to nothing more than the role of head harold abuser the only performers who really get to shine are patrick mckenna and peter as harold and ranger who deliver satisfyingly large screen versions of their small screen characters
<START> the first 1 3 of this movie i loved and thought it was going to be one of truffaut's best films i loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world sight unseen especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen pal so she could take her place she then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared i was really hooked and wanted to see more br br and then the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb despite her coming from new an island in the pacific and he from reunion an island in the indian ocean when he goes on a trip to the south of france he stumbles upon her almost immediately hmm odds are 000 000 to 1 but he finds her then instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police he forgives her even when she acknowledges what she has done okay this is tough to believe but okay but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him no one is that stupid yes the character catherine deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks this is just silly plus if he only wanted her as a sex object then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil br br this movie due to it's very ridiculous plot does not deserve such high ratings unless you are a die hard truffaut fan try another film even one of truffaut's just not this one
<START> nemesis 3 is the worst movie what i have ever seen i think that nemesis 3 was only 30 minutes long and that movie was so boo oo ring when that movie ends and i saw word nemesis 4 i thought i will not watch that movie never again
<START> well how to start i saw the italian job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop i couldn't quite remember why i had a bad feeling about it now i do br br after voting for the ratings for this film i saw the statistics apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls no wonder they didn't pay enough to charlize to flash and i guess some girls magazine has rated mark abs awesome br br other than that this film is completely predictable the actors are mainly forever b stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel the first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating to detail their gold heist all in all lots of noise about nothing br br i think charlize theron is good and ed norton could be more as he's been before apart from donald sutherland's look i'm here too appearing in the beginning i'd say this movie ought to have a pass if you're above 18 all over it
<START> loved the shots of airports dallas phoenix etc just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof and the tri motors and the well dressed passengers fast forward 75 years br br but what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a chinese adjacent the logo aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage remember when the mutual acquaintance neil and jill encounter says that become a general in a chinese rebel army that based on the hammer and sickle could only have been the people's revolutionary army of mao tse dung never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed would that logo and that reference have survived during the cold war br br additional observation 12 27 this film of the 30's with the soviet emblem may must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in hollywood and much of america during the depression adds to the historical value of this terrific film br br also i liked the american dream aspects of two guys from taking at least part of the world by storm red blooded literally and copiously in jim's case american boys br br others have commented more ably than i on the etc i loved it all br br this gem deserved more than the mere 1 5 stars osborne and co rated it on tcm if only for recording parts of american history of the early 30s
<START> mame is a disgrace to many things to lucille ball to a story which has been told better many times over and to the musical genre altogether ms ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily sedated bea arthur is good but it is not enough the production is very shoddy and cheap looking the songs are sub par and nearly every joke misfires also lucy couldn't dance well so the music had to be slowed down to a pace avoid at all costs but do see the delightful auntie mame
<START> i saw this movie a few years ago and man i never want to golf again i mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved and i'm not talking about victimless stuff like forging a scorecard no no based on what i've seen here they shamelessly massacre policemen and golfers alike on hallowed country club grounds judge would be spinning in his grave and do they repent for said sins no no based on what i have seen here the typical response by a slain ninja is to take over the body of a buxom female telephone and seek revenge i find this morally reprehensible and needless to say after viewing this nonsense i not only stopped golfing and talking on the telephone but also decided to stop feeding the homeless
