<START> lord this sucked there's a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation this film is an example i lost track of how many times women are slapped hit whipped or spanked in the film and then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped hit whipped or spanked you know they want it right sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play acting other times it plainly isn't but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to let go br br every scene of this film reeks of misogyny speaking as a straight white married man in his late 30's not a teenage lesbian women's studies major with a chip on her shoulder lest you get the wrong idea br br perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago
<START> some plot spoilers ahead br br the nashville network's so called rebirth as the first network for men is a complete disappointment as was its block of adult cartoons the new ren and stimpy was just plain awful gary the rat mediocre at best and pretty unwatchable this cartoon is mostly boring if ren and stimpy suffered from gross out overkill lacked any decent shock gags funny witless gags clever gags or gags period the concept is bad to begin with pamela anderson a stripper cum superheroine saves the city from an assortment of goofy supervillains this cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs like darkwing duck and the tick but without those wit and good writing or even good agent tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy but she is neither and this cartoon's failure to make her one or the other brings this series down br br watch your taped episodes of the tick and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like
<START> conrad ferdy mayne a hammy cult icon dies from a heart ailment not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and tv commercial director both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults his body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students they wish to invite him to dinner they are quite big fans what these kids including a young jeffrey combs don't expect is that will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest br br the list of violent acts include pulling one guy's tongue out setting a woman on fire elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face decapitates one fellow and another guy alive in a coffin a really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around ghoulish activities br br silly hokum from troma is limited by a very very low budget and slowwwwww pace the film feels a lot longer than it is the film isn't really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark at times is an ominous presence yet at other times he just looks real silly

<START> i watched this mini in the early eighties sam waterson proved himself to be a great actor in fact when he began law and order i was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it it is both factual and entertaining everyone should see it to know what really happened i was so moved i purchased and read the book of worlds and saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight if you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance mr waterston can really provide an audience enjoy the movies
<START> most christmas movies have a redemption theme but most are a variation on a very similar plot this movie is wacky and has an unusual plot you may need to hang in there for the first half where events may seem hard to believe for a movie but not as unbelievable as real life scott adams the creator of dilbert says he's never made up anything in any of his cartoons they're all based on real life stories told to him by his fans the second half starts to fit the plot together i enjoyed it br br btw one reviewer noted that the idea of someone not having cash available is not credible in these days of but it's perfectly credible if you've lost your wallet who carries atm cards anywhere else while on a business trip
<START> i was looking forward to the guardian but when i walked into the theater i wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time it's kind of like the olive garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it br br i'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect i'm still not completely sold on him something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with his simian features br br it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers' orange face lift my concerns briefly at initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and a smirk that'd make george clooney proud yeah we get it i was totally ready to hate him br br but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs br br darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clichÃ©s predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment value br br i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group br br do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isn't bad enough sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies br br man who wants all that responsibility not me i had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought i'd have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education br br not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers br br the gist br br moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but had i paid i would've felt i had gotten my money's worth
<START> this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on this has to be the worst football movie ever made this has to be one of the worst movies period the premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4 this movie isn't even a half a star bad acting scott bakula sinks as usual larry miller sinbad couldn't act if he tried rob schneider's one liners completely stunk fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower not even close a complete waste of time and of film if we could give a negative number minus 9
<START> koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down they got too carried away with stock footage and photography so little content the executive producer puts his own image in the film its just pretentious maybe if they had more than 3 million to spend maybe it would have been something i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad but godfrey the director of koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi directed this i'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together
<START> this show was so exhausting to watch and there's only two numbers drowned world substitute for love and paradise not for me were you can sit down and just contemplate it all the opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling as madonna enters the stage via a gigantic crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses galloping horses play a role in this show due to madonna falling off one the infamous scene of madonna on the crucifix is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million the number of how many african children are orphaned due to aids at the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in donating we then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown there's an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of i love new york and ray of light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements towards the end there's the music number with the song disco inferno mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known the ending again is full of energy as the show wraps up to the tunes of lucky star and hung up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end the message have you confessed comes up the dvd is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus jonas did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour
<START> this was a pathetic movie the alien was decent but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful the plot is something that's been done over and over again however this one does it the worst the acting was c p the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on no one developed any concern for the main character the movie was far too slow paced and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie there are some movies which suck but can still be enjoyed because of there total outrageousness but this doesn't even have that whoever made this film thought that they could make something good and they failed miserably there is nothing this movie has to offer except a headache avoid it
<START> this film appears to be an exposÃ© of the current trend towards globalization and in the wine industry around the world are more and more either joining large the american producer in the case of this film or paying high priced experts to help them make the perfect wine and as a result are becoming very standard and predictable to some this is a good thing especially since few can afford to pay 50 or more for an everyday wine and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller is disappearing i truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business sure good and cheaper wine is a nice thing but like what's happened with beers with giants like and busch food mcdonalds shopping european shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from american ones and mega stores like walmart asda are taking away much of the uniqueness of the little guys so i definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers however with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus the film simply became too big a chore to watch and i lost interest an 80 90 minute focused film would have been much more effective especially since the average viewer is not an that's the high brow word for a wine aficionado br br on the very positive side the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking plus the topic is so relevant and timely however despite choosing a good style of documentary making the film simply goes on way way way too long and ended up making a very dull film
<START> i have to differ from the other comments posted amid sporadic funny moments there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny the strain shows i watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation none of us were thrilled
<START> the first reviewer is right in this movie we see ourselves up to the majority being agreeable trying to stay out of trouble just trying to live our lives and we see how easily these very human traits so fundamental to the functioning of society can lead us to become complicit in a great evil br br the story is set during world war ii with the radio newspapers and movies reminding us of hitler's attacks on jews to underscore the irony of the same kind of violent anti semitism taking place in america at times that seemed a little heavy handed to me br br it feels more like a play than a movie but it's so thought provoking that such quibbles mean little perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot hinges one one little fact that struck me as rather implausible larry has lived an uneventful life until middle age yet all it takes is his beginning to wear a pair of spectacles for everyone everyone to at the first glance take him for a jew i willingly suspended disbelief because the plot kept me moving forward but the implausibility did bother me throughout the film and quite frankly i didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a jew larry seemed to think so because her name was hart and later when he married her i don't know why his neighbours assumed she was jewish for the first part of the film i wondered if there were going to be elements of fantasy larry's seemed exaggerated almost to the point of the grotesque why not call the police on seeing the rape even if the attacker was a neighbour and i thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal the red of the houses seemed too red entrance seemed deliberately overlit generally the colours were almost crayon like in their intensity br br in the credits i see that it was filmed on campbell avenue and wallace avenue in toronto so i plan to drive down there near today to check out the colours really it was good to be reminded that the clergy at that time were often leading the evil of racism remember how the pope refused to speak out against hitler seeking only to get protection for the church it was the same pope by the way who when rome was about to be liberated by american troops requested that the first soldiers to enter the city not be black check your history i don't recall ever hearing of this movie before that's a shame it certainly is of great interest to every thinking person to everyone interested in american history or racism it's one of the clearest illustrations i've ever seen of bertrand russell's dictum do not go with a crowd to do evil
