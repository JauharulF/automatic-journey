<START> this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is so much at the house that goes wrong that would not happen it isn't even funny granted this is a movie meaning things that won't happen in normal life happen here however this movie is more far fetched than theories that no child left behind is working all of these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage i could deal with an owl joke the first few times but after an hour i just can't take it i would rather kill myself than see that damn owl again did i laugh during this movie no not even once no horrible horrible horrible the fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with ashton kutcher bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse but wait the day is saved because the damn owl can fly wow amazing however i do give this movie some cred its not as bad as epic movie
<START> after the atomic bomb hits hiroshima charred bodies lie all around deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them and one person after another dies of radiation sickness this black and white film however sad and scary is not without humor the story revolves around a young woman who was hit by black rain after the explosion she is trying to get married but everyone keeps dying and people are worried the same will happen to her after finding a suitable mate who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan it will frighten you and will perhaps make you cry the acting is good not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made

<START> this movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny i found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80's movies that i have ever seen i like most 80's cheap horror movies but i would never rent this one again it just did not make any sense a family that lives in the woods invites their son his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter in law do not get along well we never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of esp and the daughter in law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this thing that we have no clue as to what it looks like all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of darth vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies then when we finally find out what and who it is all i did was laugh this killer turns out to be some kind of alien japanese warrior from ww2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family and all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of this movie is pathetic avoid it it's not even worth renting
<START> wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade a half human half vampire known the he has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood since he teamed up with whistler kris kristofferson he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries but omnipotent overlord deacon frost stephen dorff is tired of living in harmony with the humans food as he calls them and he plans to the blood god and take control of the world br br this movie is well cast written and directed ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue blade is certainly more action than horror but it definitely delivers br br 8 10
<START> the movie seemed a little slow at first but it picked up speed and got right to the point it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget i enjoyed it it is very close to reality as any movie about the atomic bombs that were to be dropped on japan i have recommended it to friends i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz
<START> bobcat goldthwait should be commended for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything melinda hamilton stars as amy a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark she struggles with telling her fiancÃ© john of course the truth does rear it's shaggy ugly head the film deals with the fallout of said escapade the movie is well acted by all save for perhaps jack as dougie who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture and the film while solid enough seems to miss it's mark a few times every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our a tad hard to relate to bobcat should be commended for doing something different as i said before but different does not always equal good and this pales ever so slightly not to own directorial debut the criminally misunderstood shakes the clown br br my grade c
<START> if a movie has an unimaginative hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really really funny you can get away with a lot if you're funny but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in grandma's boy they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance br br the movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone when alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does the movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them br br the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting the game takes place in a video game development company which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy but don't be fooled this is not a movie about video game developers this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games br br the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of j p j p is i think more or less conspired by the creator of doom john carmack at least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games br br in the movie j p is a weird obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game that makes no sense at all if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games as j p is supposed to be then even if you're quirky and obnoxious people will still admire and respect you on some level if stephen hawking is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make jun of him to his face br br also game are just as likely to be geeks as j p but in the movie they are basically frat boys it's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie and while that formula has worked very occasionally in the past it is absurd in the setting of a game company if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one unless you're a hack br br about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events and i realized i hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway so i stopped although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clichÃ©s which they did br br normally if a movie's bad i just say it's bad and then run out of things to say but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe br br shame on the movie for luring a good actress like linda into it then surrounding her with talentless nobodies i'll give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the anti shirley partridge though
<START> eagle's wing is a pleasant surprise of a movie keeps the viewer interested i didn't know anything about it being made by the british until i read the other viewer comments i can understand why it won an award for cinematography for it was brilliantly presented must have looked magnificent on a vast theatre screen br br it seemed to be a lot more realistic than most westerns in portraying how the west was more truly won as well as the complexities of the characters it presents the indian sam waterson character is particularly intriguing he seems to be brutal in the savage environment he is conditioned to but displays remarkable respect for the frailties he witnesses in the white men women he encounters he is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands but he has a limit to his sense of vengeance even a compassion when he is in a position of power observing the wilting white man bent on revenge as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach as such his character seems complex but to the harsh lands he lived in which were threatened by these intruders he is not heartless in his dealings with br br the magnificent horse he rides is a critical link it is interesting to note how this indian handles it compared with the martin sheen character who has it in his possession power for a time eagle's wing is an unusual western a genre i am not drawn to but i really appreciated this excellent offering which i would rate second only to a man called horse
<START> the bone collector is set in new york city starts as one of the world's foremost crime scene experts lincoln rhyme denzel washington is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden jump forward four years alan gary swanson his wife lindsay rubin olivia are kidnapped soon after new york cop amelia angelina jolie is called to a crime scene finds the buried mutilated body of alan amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence makes a note of it which impresses rhyme when he is asked to work on the case he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of lindsay having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill leave forensic clues for rhyme the police br br directed by phillip i watched the bone collector last night i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the lambs 1991 se7en 1995 serial killer thrillers i have seen in fact it makes friday the 13th 1980 look sophisticated realistic the script by jeremy was based on the book by jeffery is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin for a start it takes itself deadly seriously that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad the character's are truly awful i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down there's just not a lot the script can do with him in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance why is he so impressed with her then there's cheney who is not only unlikable shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh skin surgically removed from their bodies how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves the intended target rhyme anything else also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife being able to walk use their arms they are actually defeated nearly killed by a who has no movement in his body below his neck how did that happen i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's shoots rats for no apparent reason br br besides some of the worst written character's ever the story plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they i mean a bloody animal bone shaved rat hair logically how does someone go from a bone rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim has the whole of new york to choose from there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going there is so much wrong with the bone collector it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever it's atrocious on all levels has zero credibility apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting br br with a supposed budget of about 48 000 000 the bone collector is well made with good production values that hollywood gloss about it i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen i think she is absolutely terrible in this denzel washington just sort of lies there really queen latifah is awful even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichÃ©d one dimensional character br br the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while i saw it for free on telly last night i still feel cheated ripped off there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing works either way to be honest
<START> you think the police are always right br br you believe that eye witnesses are always right br br you believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98 of a basic investigation br br you believe a u s city might have a few bad apples in law enforcement but that the good cops will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil for sake in the bud br br you believe that the possibility of an ex football being as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff and being allowed to beat confessions out of randomly selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the america of the 1930s but not today br br you believe a judge will not send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer by nabbed by the police because it was hot and they did not feel like working that day br br you believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are exceptions to the rule and an injustice like this could never involve your family member someone in the middle class or someone like you br br you think that you are aware of every terrible indisputable 100 proved outrage of the last 10 years in america yet you haven't seen this film
<START> like many other people i've heard about more and i wanted to watch it due to the music that was composed by pink floyd i must say that i was truly disappointed not because of the music but the movie in itself it's a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm where does this disappointment come from according to me from different things first of all the movie's subject the drug links up badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the movie this one should have taken place in the sordid areas of paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climate for example moreover it's supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched out barbet schroeder doesn't insist enough on the dramatic side of the story you could have wished a little more of madness cutting on another hand schroeder doesn't succeed in gaining the audience's emotion and adherence in front of the two main characters' distress you watch carelessly their trials with drug whereas the two main actors they're perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the movie especially farmer at the end you only retain the beauty of the landscapes bathed in sunlight the film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969 nowadays it br br seems dated the hippy culture is nothing less than a faraway memory
<START> what distinguishes some of the 'lone star' films and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties was their lack of what we recognize as formulaic story telling to be sure they had good vs evil the basic element of any western boy meets girl and some stock characters such as the old rancher and his beautiful daughter or grand daughter and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman but the way the action played out was often different from film to film br br 'the lawless features earl in his big star turn not as for some inexplicable reason pandro a 'half apache half american posing as a mexican who speaks the language fluently ' his biggest posing as a mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi clothes the only plot seems to be that he wants to steal ruby the granddaughter of old dusty gabby hayes when meeting her for the first time gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators you'd think that because the opening scene shows killing john wayne father off camera it would play a bigger part in the film it doesn't too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains br br we get many good stunts though from yakima canutt including pulling ruby up on his horse when he rides by jumping on and knocking them off their horses a horse leap off a cliff into a lake and even the same slide down the sequence that was in the lucky texan 1934 although this time the mighty yak uses a body surfing log instead of straddling a tree bough and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too since they are in a desert br br the high point is clearly john wayne's measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling with those fantastic cliffs of red rock canyon seen in countless serials westerns and science fiction movies framed behind him no final gun duel at fifty paces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie when john wayne finally catches up with him drinks poisoned water from a and dies br br after a couple too many chase sequences gang is finally captured in cabin emerging one by one from behind a cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon now blocked off by having been no riding off into the sunset or kissing the girl the final shot is ruby now mrs john tobin on the telephone to the now sheriff john tobin what would sheriff tobin like for dinner the film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning the pacing is slow some parts with the sheriff cause it to drag and the horse chases fill up the film so despite the different and unusual elements it comes off as one of the weaker lone stars
<START> i must say i was disappointed with this film although it is well acted and directed the underlying story simply plods along too slowly br br granted in another mood i would have liked it better i did chuckle a lot but rarely laughed out loud and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day one neither of us had heard of before this one paled in comparison br br if you see lots of movies then by all means see this it's distinctly better than your average fare but if you like me have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining save this for later br br rate 7 10
<START> this took me back to my childhood in the 1950 's so corny but just fab no one ever could play flash gordon like larry buster crabbe just great i have two more series to view flash gordon's trip to mars and flash gordon conquers the universe cannot wait br br
