<START> funny yes a freleng classic to watch sylvester turn green is always a treat and it brings us back to the days when cartoon slapstick was brave and geared for the adult mind br br loved it
<START> i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadn't seen one that i hadn't liked br br the premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if you're short on funds maybe you shouldn't have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision br br there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems br br two final questions br br who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now br br how many times did this guy say man
<START> emilio is a successful business man a perfect father and a good husband or that is what everybody think the perfect storyline he has carefully built all along these years will start closing around him all of a sudden will he be able to keep up with his own lies br br this is a very well laid out drama with great acting and steady direction even though the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase the tension the movie explores some of our worst fears do we really know the people we deal with can we be so sure br br the story develops at an increasingly faster pace as it reaches the point where emilio is not in control of his lies anymore a good deal of spanish movies have interesting stories but are far from technical proficiency the perfect rhythm and well shot scenes make the actors so credible we get inside emilio and hate him and suffer for him as his situation gets more and more desperate there is no need for any spanish folklore nor is this an attempt to create a hollywood style flick this is real spain 2002 and regardless the obvious of life existing in reality there are good chances somebody we know is not quite like the person he claims to be not just a great commercial product it will let you wondering where lies can get us to can we keep up br br well done
<START> i first was made aware of this film when i saw a preview before another movie i was intrigued but it didn't get to see it before it's short run in theaters was done br br it is not an easy movie to watch multiple times there is much violence inflicted upon unarmed civilians there are lessons to be learned here one of patricia arquette's lines sums up on to americans if it didn't happen on tv it just didn't happen there is a lot of truth to that br br another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces she is an american citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass it doesn't work that way br br the scenery is beautiful the acting is all decent the professor is especially good mainly though i care about these characters francis and gray are fine but their appearance is short so they don't matter much patricia has guts in the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly as it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military dictatorships in the world in this century and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their oppression br br san is the female political leader in the movie in real life she won the nobel peace prize she was only recently released from house arrest the w bush administration as of the date i write this is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and re form the government the government was under such scrutiny that is changed the name of the country to the republic the u s government has yet to the new name br br if you don't wnat a message in your movie don't watch this one if you don't mind a little with your entertainment then it's a fine one
<START> no no is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless cgi movies being made the pastel and color pencil backgrounds were a surprise after sen to chihiro no spirited away and no shiro howl's moving castle being so similar stylistically the style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well the time and effort put in to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life the detail and care it takes makes the movie turn out so much better there are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action the greatest to me being a scene were sisters transform into massive wave like fish while she runs on top of them the story is simple but fairly well written and played out the plot stayed focused around character relationships and while it wasn't played out as well as in no totoro my neighbor totoro it is still great i felt that each character had the an appropriate amount of screen time unlike spirited away which was so jammed with distinctive characters that it could have been stretched out into an entire series the radish spirit there was a another whole movie right there my only real problem with the movie was the end the way its worded in the english version at least makes it seem like there's going to be some great test given to which turns out to be just him promising mother that he will love though putting more thought into this leads me to think that translation may not be that accurate to the actual meaning in that the test is the promise and that deep down he really means it the movie did seem to end abruptly though other than that the movie was great and i highly recommend it
<START> this is a new approach to comedy it isn't funny br br the joke is that this in and of itself is supposed to be funny br br the story is based on a french short story located in paris and the characters have french names louis for example played by bob hoskins the movie also stars the equally french jeff goldblum and natasha richardson the situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those carry on movies from years back br br i believe these are also jokes to cast these actors who make no attempt to act french in any way to have them cavort in the manner of broad english dance hall comedy and to leave the whole bloomin' mystery unexplained to the audience br br in the humour department this is practically the round table isn't it br br the movie tries to be charming and quirky and i guess these characteristics are sort of funny not as funny as duck soup or love and death perhaps but funnier than the deer hunter or the battleship potemkin br br it is an example of personal filmmaking it makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience but stays true to its premise and its internal logic although all the situations are unbelievable they are logical within the film's own bizarro world br br i generally like this kind of eccentric movie but i found this one to be paced too slowly to be dull witted tedious and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit it just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways and wastes some wonderful talents along the way it has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars who are all otherwise distinguished players i found it to be the biggest waste of talent since the betsy and i wish i had never seen goldblum and hoskins in this thing br br so call it an interesting miss and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill br br
<START> this movie was horrendous it had absolutely nothing to do with dark harvest and the dvd was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe neither of which appeared in this movie br br the beginning was a jumble of random scenes that most of which had nothing to do with the movie except that they sort of show that the man is psychic but not too well br br after the first 10 minutes of the movie there is an hour of just the man character looking for his daughters it gets vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before but that's the extent of it br br and why might i ask was this movie rated r there were two drops of blood and 4 curse words and how on earth did it get into a video store this movie was poorly acted poorly filmed poorly written and overall horribly executed
<START> a teen aged girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex jockey to participate in london's grand national a fine adaptation of the classic children's book with an excellent start making performance by taylor as the energetic but polite youngster rooney is ok as her trainer although he has some overly melodramatic moments crisp and revere are quite good as taylor's loving parents filmed in technicolor it looks beautiful the problems are that there are corny elements nothing very interesting happens and it drags on a bit too long the race is exciting but could have been much more so
<START> the man with the golden arm otto preminger's controversial panoramic crime drama plays itself out among the mental descriptions of its living and architectural occupants in rhythmic lashing arrangement opening the film a closeup from within a bar of frankie looking in through the window already tells us to the prominence that the protagonist's subjective experience will grasp pulled in the direction of increasingly slighter spaces the film shuts itself off as the local gangster's long drawn out poker game shuts itself from the daylight bolts itself in as sinatra's frankie machine has himself locked in a room in the celebrated scene of his harrowing struggle to overcome his habit in delving into the shapes and faces of its jazzy urban haven the visual traffic in the man with the golden arm characterizes skewed psychological circumstances forming an overpowering environment as maintained by the recurring tracking shots into closeups of frankie's eyes br br the grace of this fiery drama striking as early as the exciting opening crane shot displays the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows the wonderfully dilapidated urban sets define an independent place with no beginnings or ends an indeterminate state the sort that in reality hardly last as long as this skid row seems to before being gentrified or leveled the flair of certain performances particularly robert as the wonderfully named underworld gambling boss and arnold as frankie's trusty four eyed lapdog becomes this fiery surreal feature pleasingly the premise of drug addiction sinatra's powerhouse performance elmer bernstein's infectious forceful jazz score and saul famous influential and controversial opening sequence centering on the animated paper cut out of a heroin addict's arm ensured that in its era the man with the golden arm presses forward upon the cause for realism in the still reticent hollywood it is impressionistic and subjective as i say but its intent its force and its spirit are much closer to home br br what absorbs me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film it has the illegal card games short cons the fights the guns the double crosses characters on the lam a femme fatale a stunningly sexy gun moll the shady nightclubs and urban landscape but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment really it is the perfect environment and genre in which to tell this story a crime ridden urban borough where it's all too comfortable to escape through a bottle or two or three or four or drugs a transient dose that really just functions to keep one in obscurity from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could bid
<START> extremely boring i don't care how many avant garde bones you have in your body this baby sucks and don't go and see it because i mentioned that save it for warhol's empire it's far more entertaining i have seen other films that were far better so i am dumbfounded why this is considered a masterpiece as an art historian i have had to consider radical works by marcel chris burden and damien hurst and in these artist i can still see artistic intent even quality and an entertaining aspect in the rendering of their art as for india song it's not even soft porn nin was almost here g rated slide show of sex and a voice over that does not relate to the slide show movie pure crap and not even campy sadly just a bore and a waste of 2 hours to add insult to injury the print i saw was faded and scratched to hell harvard film archive if i want to see entertaining boring i watch bunuel yes india song hold your head high to late modernism and be truly bored watch a 70's porn film with all the good parts cut out and turn the sound down you'll get india song but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or the screams of the vice consul
<START> i first saw this on thames television and loved it i subsequently saw a dreadful write up by someone who certainly hadn't watched or listened to it so i bought a copy and then i bought another copy the only sad thing is that it is not available on pal vhs or region 2 dvd the australian version is great but this one is better i might buy another
<START> this may not be the worst movie ever made but it is absolutely the most boring wonder why it is shot mostly in the dark and mostly with vincent gallo walking away from the camera or looking down because he doesn't want to show his face for actually agreeing to being in this movie i liked his early stuff but the pretentiousness of the brown bunny and then being cast in this drivel knocked him down a peg in my book and val kilmer i actually want to send him a sympathy card the doors to this actually the casting was the only reason i watched this movie and val doesn't even show up until the movie is more than halfway over simply a sad movie
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen after watching it i walk out like what happened i am confused to this day can someone explain that movie to me please both the acting and picture quality are so bad you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder first i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie because it's unbelievably bad movie this movie isn't scary at all there is even no typical horror clichÃ©s too the plot and acting of this movie was terrible it's not fantastic surrealistic or horror it's just hideously bad turkish feature film and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters when i watch i fell into so hopeless so sad for young turkish movie maker please please don't make 'cinema' like this
<START> another gray horrible bit of schlockiness from the family corman the first space capsule into outer space crash lands back on earth with some of the worst special effects ever and the pilot appears to be dead but appearances can be deceiving he's actually more alive than the rest of the cast including a patronizing misogynist old doctor who'd also really really boring a greasy guy who looks like he's cornered the market on hair oil another guy so dull he doesn't even make much of an impression a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry over the old guy's patronizing and a female photographer with a farah fawcett haircut pre farah of course and about as much liveliness as a dead duck br br what are any of these people's names i think it was steve apparently everyone in the cast including the women were called steve anyway the dead pilot steve turns out to not only be alive but to be baby aliens or or shrimp or whatever inside his torso the momma beast that implanted these little critters looks like a giant bald parrot with claws once again i am impressed by the laugh ability factor of the monsters created by the house of corman the space carrot from venus in it conquered the world is still officially the worst most laughable monster i've ever seen grace the screen but the cormans always manage to deliver when it comes to bad cheesy looking monsters br br they also managed to deliver on their other trademarks as well i e a boring confusing plot long gray shots thank god corman did most of his films in black and white since his color stuff still manages to look somehow gray two or three locations max stupid and lame props and special effects and lots and lots of dull dialog there's only two deaths in the film if you don't counted the roasted parrot err alien blood beast being offed at the end of the film cheers rang out through the land i'm sure when the alien rips the old doctor's head off and apparently eats it now it can talk in english and has the doctor's memories it can also move the pregnant astronaut around as though he were pinnochio br br the monster's apparent intent is to rebuild its race using human beings as food and giant there's a confusing bit at the end well more confusing than usual anyway in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this but it makes no sense whatsoever something about how humanity is about to follow in its race's footsteps and destroy themselves by something they'll soon create it never really said what that was it could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches who knows its baby minder stabs himself rather than let the alien shrimp crawl out of his body and the oily guy and the other guy burn the parrot alien to death with a molotov cocktail ahh the smell of roasting chicken err alien end of story in which the rest of the characters wander off and leave their dead comrade laying on the ground to rot oh hell why not save yourself the expense of a funeral i'm sure that was what corman was thinking when he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheaply as possible
