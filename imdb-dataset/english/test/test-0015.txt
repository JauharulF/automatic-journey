<START> after all these years of solving crimes you would've expected criminals to know that they can't afford making mistakes with him especially not with regards to talking much this time br br columbo goes to college and actually explains his entire technique but for some reason the murderer still doesn't pay enough attention however this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues
<START> i was really surprised to see that unlike most documentaries this was written directed and produced by a film critic richard most of the times i know of where film critics had major involvement in films the films turns out to be bombs rex reed starring in myra breckenridge and roger ebert writing beyond the valley of the dolls are prime examples however in this case the critic's powers are used for good and not evil and the results are better though this isn't saying much as the films i just mentioned are among the worst films ever made br br as for the documentary it's narrated by clint eastwood a pretty good choice and manages to discuss his long career from his silent days until his death in the early 1960s the only negatives and they are slight are that the film is awfully short as are most film documentaries and there is very little about gary cooper as a human being you really don't learn all that much about his life however as a nice overview of his films it works very well
<START> 'don't look in the is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that is one of horrors real underground stars and imho is vastly overdue some proper recognition is his undisputed masterpiece this scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on it succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness and he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory there is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing in a word classic also if you watch first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks other films in summary they really don't come any more esoteric than this well actually they do track down 'keep my grave mad genius accept no substitute
<START> i remember this movie with feelings of sheer agony more than half of the film is commercials no really the slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes and almost is the end result is a love story of predictable schlock all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary debbie boone hit yep that's how fast it was produced the song that inspired it was still big on the charts when the film was released br br despite decades of seeing bad movies this one still impresses me for its extravagant no holds barred headlong jump into the most tedious absurd and indelible cinematic badness it truly deserves to be on the imdb list of the 100 worst of all time and has never left the top 3 on my personal worst list br br enjoy it for the sheer masochistic thrill
<START> this is such a beautiful movie not only does it portray war it also has friendship love the life of is filled with sadness every aspect of his life fell apart i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice br br i see a slight similarity to 'pearl harbor' which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman however this film is much better made because this does not portray the woman to be unfaithful easy going the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing well built up i definitely recommend this movie to all people
<START> jack frost 2 the worst horror film i have ever seen why 1 the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2 the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on 3 it escapes after being completely submerged in anti freeze first film 4 get this it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film 5 killer snowballs i have yet to be drunk enough to see ginger dead man so as of the writing of this jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest horror film ever even surpassing the of it's predecessor if you can believe that
<START> ms sen the maker of mr mrs iyer directs this movie about a young girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating condition br br konkona sen has been an aloof kid ever since childhood and has shown signs of delusion no one knows why the dormant tendency however slips out of control when the job assignment takes her to neighboring bihar where she's raped by some political goons the resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic depressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia she careens out of control over the years progressively getting worse and sinking deeper into her private 'world' br br the juxtaposition of an divorced elder sister and how her domineering ways make an already bad situation worse is indicative of what a fine line there is between abnormal and seemingly normal ms sen also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly mind altering drugs but what about the poor and the destitute who're always left to fend for themselves and usually fall by the wayside br br the romantic connection between dr kunal and anu was unnecessary also the cafeteria scene where dr kunal explains to anu how real their world really is to them was redundant anu should already know all that the english dialog is a bit awkward at times though the acting compensates for that konkona and shabana prove that their reputation is every bit worth it waheeda rahul and shefali play their limited roles very well br br extensive research seems to have been done about this illness its very evident but its not clear if can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient side by side also in the early part dr kunal recommends e c t shock therapy while the fact that it doesn't work for schizophrenics only for extreme with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder br br the ending of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution maybe no solution the movie could have ended on a nicer note since worldwide the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fruitful if not very fulfilling lives under good medical care br br nonetheless its an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject hats off to ms sen no one in india could've done it better
<START> in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper br br the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people won't really pay to see either the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air time br br the first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch r rated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
<START> i just viewed jean renoir's wonderful film french can can it is a visual delight and a great entertainment the recently produced moulin rouge pales by comparison i didn't quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received now i'm convinced more than ever that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like jean renoir's version of the same story he succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast and the great french actor jean gabin was in rare form the dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one i'd ever seen it was long but i didn't want it to end this film deserves to receive more recognition than it's got
<START> after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters i was hooked on the topic i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie people getting vaporized people panicking fire explosions it was all so great br br so a few weeks later i enter my video store and i see david michael version of war of the worlds on the shelf it couldn't have come onto dvd that fast could it i said to myself i read the back of the case and saw c thomas howell instead oh i remember him from the outsiders so i thought it might have been a try br br i was wrong dead wrong as soon as i watched the opening credits watched them take forever i knew something was wrong something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did the whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years from the acting the special effects stupid looking tripod things when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons and most of all it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version in fact the plot was boring and there were only 3 scenes of destruction what the crap i ended up being so bored that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting and nothing was really br br my advice don't even touch this movie stay 100 feet away from it the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month buy that one but please please i beg of you stay away from this turd before it smothers us all
<START> normally i am a typical creepy crawly girl but after watching this film on youtube of course i'm having different perspectives and also i did not know that my favorite animation studio fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans lighted cigars and cigarette butts footsteps etc and how a plucky young grasshopper named saves the day and wins the heart of honey the bee i love the lovely ms honey you know after watching the film the bugs reminded me of the some of the bugs from don and out of the songs in the film i love we're a couple in the castle when i sing that song it almost made me cry br br this wonderful film was the second and final feature to come out of the fleischer studio the film was originally going to be released on november of 1941 but since the fleischer's rival disney released dumbo weeks earlier paramount changed the date to december of the same year but mr bug unfortunately went into a then unrealized trap of terrible timing having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on pearl harbor mr bug was a financial disaster and led to the of max and dave fleischer from the studio they had established in 1919 and reorganized the company as famous studios another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes how sad it was overall i love both films from the fleischer bros gulliver and mr bug
<START> jack o 1995 was a really bad movie we are talking snoozefest x 100 no entertainment value whatsoever no budget no gore z grade actors etc etc this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn't have been made the only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew linnea quigley was in it and sure enough she does her obligatory nude shower scene which is lovely yes br br but as for the film itself i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had no desire at all to finish it it's just bigtime lame ok br br i love horror movies i'm an avid fan a massive fan i love low budget horrors i love it all but i hated this rubbish so i think that will tell you all you need to know about jack o br br i give this movie 2 10 the 2 is for the 2 minute linnea shower scene the movie itself is a total zero
<START> i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival br br this is the first indian film i've seen in the tamil language and while it does share some similarities with other indian films wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline the director attempts more than just to entertain the film tells the story of a precocious nine year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war torn sri lanka gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point though it is a simplistic one is played by p s and she is one of the few child actors i've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying her charm and beauty held the film together
<START> know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples 1 in the movie paul really meets before he dies in the book poirot only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if plan would have succeeded poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been poirot was in the morgue when mrs identified the victim 2 the movie has combined two persons into one cinderella has been removed by the movie the girl hastings falls in love with and the ex girlfriend of jack are one person in the movie why for god's sake 3 hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid 4 the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you shouldn't know 5 the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn't exists in the book perhaps because the person cinderella who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie 6 the book is very complex the movie takes only about 90 minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning e g bicycle race
<START> brilliant film i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f but thats how it is with post pulp era many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick but this one is well written funny coincidences ordinary gangsters who are family men resemble something from tarantino which is a good similarity br br anyway the film's about a guy bloke in australia which is getting mixed up with a hard core crime gang and ends up in a debt and deep s it to his assistance is his deceased brother anyone remember val kilmer in true r to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail the gangsters are cold blooded but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children they also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery so a humorous gangster flick with heath ledger in good form though i'm not a fan and bryan brown in great action as a gang leader
