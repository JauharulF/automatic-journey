<START> right here we go you have probably read in previous reviews on this film that it is awful badly acted avoid at all costs well i suppose in some ways this is true it is fair to say that you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plot to spoil however there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter the acting is so bad the plot so non existent and the ending so completely baffling it will have you laughing the whole way through there are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level do not expect an oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster it is worth every penny
<START> this story takes place in wisconsin i was half heartedly watching my tape when i heard the name i wasn't sure where it was taking place until i heard them say green bay then i figured it was wisconsin watching further confirmed it br br anxiously awaiting the outcome i could really feel frustration i did not know it was based on fact until the end it left me glad but sad and wanting to know more
<START> good grief to think i've seen it all danny thomas looks so out of place in this mishmash he seems really uncomfortable he can't sing worth a lick and when he's paired up with peggy lee peggy lee she easily easily him maybe the director saw this and made him do the really bad comedy routines that he sometimes does in the film peggy lee is okay but the whole thing is a shambles good for a laugh maybe
<START> is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production if i remember correctly we had to watch it on a uhf station and this meant using a in those days uhf not part of regular tv to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious i remember all the sound effects that gerald used to talk a great memory from 50 years ago i'll have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web by the way i try to do computer animation thats where the comes into the picture
<START> to quote clark griswold in the original christmas vacation worse how could things get any worse take a look around here ellen we're at the threshold of hell little did chevy chase know that he was describing the sequel to one of his best films christmas vacation ii sets a new high or maybe it should be low in bad movies my wife bought this dvd thinking it would actually be a sequel to the original but we were severely disappointed this film is lame it bears no resemblance to the original is an absolute waste of film and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it it must have set a record on imdb for the most bad reviews i really think we have a good case to win a class action lawsuit to recover the money we consumers wasted on this movie
<START> it begins with a couple of disgusting sex comedy gags but soon it reveals its true colors it wants to be a death wish clone i say wants to because the script gets so increasingly laughable by the minute that it ends up looking like an absurdist death wish spoof from a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles to heroes who dress up as commandoes and wave their machine guns because they don't want to attract attention to themselves to bad guys who drive around the city in a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle this film has too many ludicrous points to fit in a list the other major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart of course you know who borgnine and roundtree and even james van patten are but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes and you wouldn't know the difference 1 2
<START> the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by richard williams bell son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell titled our family trouble to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line if you must know the story read about it its much more gripping and conclusive
<START> people seem to be expecting citizen kane here the planet is a b monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed the director clearly has something to offer not so sure about some of the cast as for the effects ain't a lot of effects budget i for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci fi head or anyone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously if so watch blue instead i noticed one review saying it had ripped off alien like alien didn't rip things off the best thing about the film the director the worst thing about the film the cast maybe it's time for the director to move from glasgow to london and find some talent in the meantime well done at least you're trying to do something
<START> andreas arrives in a strange city he doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there he is ordered to arrive at work and gets his own apartment in the city all his co workers are nice and polite to him they say hi and smile when they pass by him but then later on andreas discovers that the city isn't that pleasant as it seems going home from work he see some people wearing grey suits cleaning up the bloody mess of a dead body apparently a suicide victim that had thrown himself out of the window the procedure is done with a calmed mind as if they were emptying a trashcan the following day andreas meets the suicide victim fully alive at work more and more andreas discovers the atmosphere of the city br br den might be the best norwegian film i've seen original artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films with only a few exceptions the plot is also very original and could even be called post modern horror as the film present us a terrifying thought of having to cope with a world that is completely and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning the more meaningless it becomes i am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a universe a nightmare that you simply cannot escape from not even with death br br go see it its really worth it i gave it 9 out of 10
<START> i have seen this movie twice now on cable the first time i saw it it caught me by suprise the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70's these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life's problems however this film did a great job of taking me back back to the vacant pools the backyard and the road trips to cherry hill nj i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it you had to live it otherwise it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me but for those of you and you know who you are who did live it you know exactly what i am talking about in any event i don't care who you are if you get a chance to see this movie do it i give thanks to the z boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie job well done
<START> naturally sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen it is such a piece of sh and loaded with complete bullsh i didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever it was all awful jokes br br the acting sucks many of the characters sucked at acting charlotte arnold sadie is such a terrible actor the other characters suck too magaret rain hal br br the plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable this is one of the worst shows made of all time it shouldn't have even been made the idiots who are responsible of writing this garbage should get fired if they already didn't the fist season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster its too hard to watch this show it is beyond awful
<START> i saw this film when it was released to theaters it's definitely one to remember i had forgotten the title until recently a friend found it via online search br br one dark night is rather unusual for the suspense horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways it's a nice old school film with props and scenes that reflect the times our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket for example br br as has been mentioned by previous reviewers one dark night is currently available on dvd the original negative was not available for the dvd transition some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn't take away from the story that being said the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good br br adam west plays a rather part in this film as son in law his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short br br the story builds over the course of the film unlike many horror films of the era one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening br br the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum pull the coffins out open them and move the corpses around attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes the rotting worm riddled corpses look quite real
<START> rks after the success of ghayal started work on this film which was a comedy the film was in making for 3 years and released finally in 1994 but didn't work for some reason before this film damini 93 released and did well br br the film is a mad comic film like most priyadarshan films nowdays but it is funny and well handled the film has a proper plot unlike today's films and makes you laugh most characters became famous be it crime master gogo shakti kapoor paresh rawal and others br br the film keeps you laughing throughout it's run time though being too slapstick and overdone yet it's one of the funniest films br br direction by rks is very good music is good br br amongst actors aamir steals the show and delivers his funniest performance this was his first out n out comedy salman does well but looks amateur front of aamir yet does a good job and their chemistry is delightful karisma is annoying and sounds like a child raveena is adequate paresh rawal is too funny in both roles shakti kapoor is hilarious in his over the top act khan dubbed by is very good and viju too is funny rest all are good too
<START> once in a great while i will watch a movie that completely surprises me one that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment one that is pure fun from beginning to end well folks when a stranger calls is not that movie it is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic our lead heroine jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller every clichÃ© in the world is used here from the stupid cat jumping out of a hidden spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime this movie is bad not even bad in a so bad it's good way more in a so bad it's boring way skip this godawful film and save your movie for something else you'll thank me later trust me on this grade d
