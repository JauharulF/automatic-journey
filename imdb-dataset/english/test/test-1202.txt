<START> the unfunniest so called comedy i've ever seen br br not a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dare twin town br br vegas i like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well english in the worst way in recent years the english films have been awful all of them ireland at least produced the commitments scotland with braveheart and trainspotting 2 stand out great movies and wales had twin town zulu last days of torchwood doctor who and under milk wood etc br br the comedy is paint by numbers the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunny br br england is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce it's the old class system that destroys english films the graduates spewing endlessly clichÃ©d scripts about working class people they've never lived with it is pathetic monty python wasn't funny neither was anything from br br let guys like jonny vegas and peter kay rob billy connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the british and english film industries will rise again what next prince edward to write a modern day oliver twist
<START> this is one of those movies that you just don't want to end the characters are rich like a well woven tapestry colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war a young man is taken in by a dynamic big hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences br br i couldn't believe this was a made for television film it was so well executed s is wonderful as nanny and she brings so much life to this role you want to be right there amongst her boarders br br i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd
<START> this is a good movie i won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that however i disagree with the statement that this is eastwood's best work that is just not a very position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in i would like to note that i find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie and peggy drier never again appeared in another film or television show in spite of giving good performances my curiosity has me wondering what happened to these two actresses
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br danny mel is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his job and to be a good dad to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother maxine but after an altercation with said daughters present at a working men's club he uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at louis colin salmon and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym free weights section there and to train himself into a tougher more assertive person before long he's taken the philosophies of louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman as the 80s disco faze kicks in but when associate sparky scott williams tries to do a sideline in drug dealing everything turns pear shaped br br as robert de niro once stated in the film a bronx tale 'there's no bigger tragedy than wasted talent ' the writer of clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film but without the ability it seems to put it all together into some sort of coherent film br br as a brummie some of the filming locations especially a scene at the end outside the ring o' bells pub in moseley were quite easy and fun to spot but the dour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things some really poor acting for instance lead actor with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though more established actors like and even telly favourite neil are sidelined to very small supporting parts while the disastrous and ronnie fox's lame villain take centre stage williams does a poor man's sick boy from trainspotting impression leaving salmon and shaun parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing as the excessive blood splattered violence becoming a common trend for brit flicks takes over truly a missed opportunity
<START> love jones is one of the best movies i've experienced br br the main element that sticks out to me is the fact that it is very well directed i have studied this film in it's entirety with watching movies more than once certain things dawn on you subconsciously the direction of this movie as well as the writing is chic hip and artful i am in love with the direction the scene where larenz tate and long are riding the motorcycle through north chicago at night is astonishing the director of this movie deserved awards for his great job br br love jones is a classy and sexy film it highlights the fact that we can be people who love who have flaws who love living learning and just being us without the hype being our natural selves br br the poetry is wonderful but the story line the dialog and the scenes really make this movie br br this movie deserves to be seen it is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch or the hopeless romantic like myself to sit back and enjoy alone on a friday or saturday night any day of the week where peace solitude and a little entertainment is needed love jones is what i recommend
<START> this film is a bad film but to gain any nutritional value from it i recommend watching it back to back with rosemary's baby br br there is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters observe minnie ruth gordon and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film br br it is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch rosemary's baby before making this br br if your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one i have a lot more to say about this film but i really don't want to go there
<START> this film was one of three that were later combined by chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title the chaplin review br br this was an odd film in some ways because later in life chaplin was anti war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood this film in contrast is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the us efforts in wwi it's truly odd to see charlie as the super soldier who single handedly captures 13 germans casually and coolly shoots several germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the kaiser himself truly this was a major departure for the little tramp though it was at the same time very very entertaining and funny the film is exceptionally well paced well made and i'm sure did a lot to bolster support at home for our troops too bad it was such a pointless and costly war
<START> gamers dr is not a fancy made movie it's more like amateur video horrible magic effect really fake fireball terribly made dungeon castle village sword axe shield robe plate everything you will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual then you will get 105 minutes of fun br br i'm from hongkong and it's really hard to find none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d d watching gamers dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer you see rule books game set etc etc etc you hear terms like fighter wizard hit point level character flaming hand chaotic evil br br what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to not bonded by software rpg gamers dr provide the same element you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead the movie goes both real life as well as in the d d world you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action which make you feel you really in the game br br i don't want to spoil anything but in short gamers dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers for people never play rpg game i'm sure you still get many fun from it
<START> homecoming what a huge disappointment after reading the plot summary the dead coming back to vote against george w bush i couldn't wait to see this it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention unfortunately though it slowly descended into a boring political satire that i didn't need to see i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary i couldn't believe this came from joe dante who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire br br the worst episode so far br br 2 5
<START> on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten however viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate post civil war america one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one and eagle's wing is such a horse but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter who should own it the native american or the awol soldier the story throughout pits against civilisation as has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you're ever likely to see again the film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite martin sheen's performance is a revelation this film released in the same year as sheen's other great performance as willard in 'apocalypse now' hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again more's the pity a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them not least that both films chart a man's journey into his soul in order to find redemption whereas willard is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if pike is eventually the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned altogether this is an extraordinary film
<START> this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen the stark scenery the isolation the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion a backdrop for some and sophistication the acting is completely natural but for me as a the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well whether or not the cafe really exists i don't know but i do know of similar establishments and babette's menu and choice of are authentic and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
<START> yes fassbinder and are at the top of their game back in 1973 it's about the same subject but in my opinion it's a much better movie than the matrix 1999 at least it was 200 times cheaper very nice camera work by michael and the wonderful albatross by fleetwood mac at the end fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film it's a shame this movie was never released on dvd but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion that this tv movie is not only one of the best fassbinder films altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films it's a brilliant example for a science fiction movie done without much money buy it watch it
<START> brian wesley works for a security firm owned by mr norton conrad bain the norton firm is in financial trouble for unknown to the owner he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner jim bacchus it's not brian as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor but mr norton has no patience with brian in part because norton's beautiful daughter casey valerie bertinelli has a thing for brian and norton questions brian's motives for wooing her however brian does come up with a great security device it's called chomps which stands for canine home security system the device which looks like a dog is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars the rival owner sends two bungling spies one is red buttons to learn the details of the new invention will chomps save norton security this is a fun family flick from the old school of good clean entertainment chomps is of course a real dog played by the adorable and talented benji in fact benji has a duel role as brian has a real dog named rascal too just watching this little dog in action is pure joy as he is able to scale walls pull trucks and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys the human cast is also quite nice with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious costumes scenery and production values are good too although you may have trouble locating the film it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones chomps is a wonderful wholesome diversion from the world's woes
<START> okay i guess i'm pretty much a fan of mutilated and destroyed stephen king stories when they reach the as any of us sad masochists out here i know full well that most of them are done poorly i expect it i plan on it i humbly allow for it br br but this time okay so i think i saw this thing a number of years ago fine i thought i remembered that it was pretty good wrong like i'm saying granted in a wordy annoying roundabout way i really wasn't trying to be snobby or expect much but what was this thing a mini series i have only one thing to say d r a w n o u t how can you possibly justify dragging the thing out minute by minute scene by scene of friggin' endless completely meaningless and mind numbingly slow dialog i mean every bl dy scene is two people how they feel and back and forth and d r a g i t bl dy well o u t after about an hour and a half which i think is about 1 2 of the running time i didn't check sorry i finally got totally fed up after an hour and a half what had happened other than the original accident they were running away while the guy was killing eye doctors news photographers and lots lots lots of meandering dialog br br i'm sorry i promise that it is not that i have to have non stop mindless action i love lots of films where not much happens but in them at least when they do talk and such meaningful things are being said and characters are being deepened thoughts are being conveyed something okay i admit that the actors in and of themselves were not too bad except stephen king of course i liked the shop guy i thought both of the people were fine i liked the general and the main woman it's just if they could have cut out all of the hours of filler that's all i'm saying i mean it's supposed to be a sci fi thriller sort of right you know what really took the prize when the shop guy was needlessly making one of his many time filling telephone calls this time he is talking to god knows who getting all emotional for him anyway and acting like he can't handle it wtf the guy has clearly been shown to be a cold blooded efficient killer what the hell was that about so just multiply that by about 500 and that is basically why i finally turned if off about half way through it was either that or hang myself i swear i mean there are other king out there that are lame but at least they move along oh well i guess perhaps if you maybe are into the 'story' itself and don't mind crawling along and have the supreme divine patience to wait until the end it might be worthwhile br br but i sincerely and humbly doubt it br br i don't write these things very often but this time i just had to or i wouldn't be able to sleep at night like i did during the show
<START> i caught this movie right in my eye when i was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema the tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it i thought of the possibility of it being similar to national lampoon's dorm daze i liked that movie aside from having a huge collection of such genres i decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension br br delightfully i came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie amanda bynes definitely kicked it off better than keira knightley in bend it like beckham being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to this movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time the only way of pulling it off is through this movie br br the principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors i'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry you will get laughs throughout the movie it is a definite guarantee
