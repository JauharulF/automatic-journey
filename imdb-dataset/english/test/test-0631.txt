<START> i was lucky enough to see the horror classics dvd version of this film before it was mysteriously removed from the 4 film dvd and replaced with something else the picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself yet that version is still superior to the one with the deluxe dvd treatment the reason was stated in brad interview segments on the special edition dvd he had noted what i first found so striking about this film this being the use of music at moments of inactivity in the film but leaving the moments of activity in silence thus giving the horror scenes a stronger feel the problem with this reissue is it carries the extra film score used to fill in these intentional gaps in score complained of this and made it clear that the filler music was not his the music actually sounded a lot like howard shore's work for videodrome sad for me that i am also a major fan of that film and have to associate the two br br the film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror film a group of friends go up on a mountain one of them inherited on the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmarish secret the movie moves along at a great pace in fact every time i have seen it i still find myself shocked to see 45 minutes had passed before things started really going wrong for the campers br br while the horror classics version is filled with many gaps the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to most slasher films i have ever seen the director jeff had made some unique horror films previous to this one making this one the most mainstream and yet very different to the mainstream at the same time it is a good fun film with surprising acting performances to boot the new up dvd version is worth a rent the now collectors item horror classics version now oop is worth the hunt
<START> best cinematography i have ever the year the movie was made i was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity though i am not particularly a western movie every single scene is given the utmost detail and it is haunting there is a sincere connection with nature at times i am overwhelmed with the amount of action passing through the scenes but i am never bored i feel as though i am truly peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west i recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design location planning and for that matter photography in general it can be a humbling movie to experience with regards to the visuals considering this era of digital touch up that we now experience
<START> this show is pretty alright and fun to watch its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining br br i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons this show has completely changed around in the first season it was more about science and animals all that is gone now in the season and third season its more about her life and dating ever since that gay kid ben came along this show has sucked the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy disney took a turn for the worse i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore they're all garbage
<START> in brooklyn the nightclub dancer rusty parker rita hayworth has a simple but happy life dancing in the mcguire's owned by her boyfriend danny gene kelly rusty danny and genius phil silvers have a ritual on friday nights they order oysters in a bar trying to find a pearl the life of rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway whose owner proposes her she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style missing the love of danny and her old friends girl' is a delightful romantic comedy very naive and having magnificent parts such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing singing and acting gene kelly specially in two scenes dancing with himself and with rusty and genius on the street the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars danny the character of gene kelly is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior rita hayworth surprised me with her talent i found her amazing in 'gilda' but she is stunning in girl' in accordance with the information on the cover of the vhs girl' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot giving continuity to the story instead of just being in the movie my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved girl' therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations my vote is nine br br title brazil
<START> spoilers spoilers i loved the set up and consistently laughed throughout the entire movie the acting was great with my favorite part being howard's kevin kline attempts to be a manly man the fiance and parents did a great job as a supporting cast spoiler warning the acting of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable my only problem with the end was the fact that howard was actually gay the movie is set up as a be who you want to be but the movie actually does the opposite howard's logic behind his discovery is the fact that he loves barbra streisand's movies and enjoys dancing to music his mannerisms and tastes appear to be gay and it isn't until it is pointed out to him that he realizes it rather than setting howard free it pigeon holes him oh he likes to dance to music than he must be gay his confession at the marriage felt like a bending down to society's wishes in the end the movie becomes a gay rights movie which was not the original course it almost becomes bland with the rest i believe the movie would had been ultimately better had howard been straight it would have been truer to the message
<START> black water is a movie that in a way surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations black water is truly a very well structured unpredictable thrilling well directed and well creepy movie the plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you intrigued with it one thing i love about this movie is the direction because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations my original expectations of black water was that it was a crappily made acted directed paced and boring movie it really wasn't well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didn't show enough emotions and there are some lines that feel just so scripted however i love the direction because all of it's shots seem predictable but arn't like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water and it goes quite you're like the croc's about to attack however the croc's attacks are very unpredictable which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly and this does make you jump plus i just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump but instead the actual movie i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees it made it seem very real and definitely kept your eyes on the screen i must say i didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well and i think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life plus i didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't also again i just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic for example i wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it let alone a killer one however these problems really arn't that major and i was still able to enjoy the film overall as far as movies go i've seen better but as far as animal attack horror films a genre i get easily scarred at it's one of the better ones you'll see and sure it's not perfect but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot
<START> tip have it read to you heres how br br 1 copy and paste this to notepad not word 2 go to start all programs accessories narrator br br having your testicles ironed br br when jonathan ross started his career he was on a show call the last resort now a days he is the first resort to host anything and anything tv award shows that half the time he is up for nominations in comic relief chat shows quiz shows game shows charity shows brighton just when you at you wits end and think you can find salvation in the wireless the lisping twang of good old j r hits you like a freight train going none stop from texas to downtown n y that has lost a hour and is trying to make it up br br about this show br br its a normal chat show format with j r as host and a house band that of four gay men ha ha ha ow my aching sides and season one had andy davis but he left or was fired to give way to ross's ego br br ross will more less use his guests as props and you really don't hear them speak because of his its my ball and i'll take it home attitude you also see that the bigger the guest the more he is willing to lie and suck up to them to get in with the big boys like the weak kid at school who hangs round with the bully br br however when a small reality t v star comes on he'll happily humiliate them asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their lack of talent to get the laughs sometimes he will under estimate the popularity of a guest say something to belittle them and then when the audience act shocked he will quickly turn and start making himself the fall guy the best example of this was when life on mars star john came on and he said how does someone like you get work your ok looking but not hollywood good looking bare in mind the hugh jackman and halle berry was in the green room he was really only trying to suck up to them before they were even on the couch when the audience acted shock ross quickly said what i'm bit light headed from wearing that corset i don't know what i'm saying if he don't have any low forms of tv life on he'll just dig at the four gay men on the piano with jokes more out of date than his fashion br br its very much a different story when a hollywood a lister or big tv star comes on the show in that he'll tell them stories to humor them when some actor explains that he was in a support band then jonathon ross will say something like wow well he ever i go to see a band i was try to look interested for the support band to make them feel as though they are wanted with an underline message being please like me i was probably one of the people that cheered you when you was in your band top this off with an audience of ross fans so hooked on every bad old joke and it really makes for a poor show br br your better off watching us chat shows instead they are more scripted but not anywhere near as hard to watch
<START> it's hard to decide what to say about this one it isn't totally one hundred percent bad although the movie in a movie is unspeakably bad meant to be campy but missing by a mile i'm pretty sure that this is intentional however danny aiello is perfectly adequate here and more or less nails his pathetic character dyan cannon was good in a small role was impressive as the latest twenty something girlfriend and linda carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well br br so it's not totally bad but i don't believe that this one accomplishes its goals all in all it's probably worth passing on
<START> i have to say that i haven't expected that this movie to be this good usually the eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90 of the films however this film surpasses the romanian cinema being worthy of some more advertisement br br the acting is truthfully and not exaggerated the plot is simple yet complex as it presents the life in the romanian suburbia the sound amazed me the directing was good and what more can i say br br this crash of eastern europe was drawn me into the film living each moment of it i have even felt a desire coming out of me a desire for adventure after seeing it br br watch it you will definitely enjoy it br br 7 10
<START> for a country that has produced some of the world's finest dramatists and has such a rich musical heritage it has always been a source of bewilderment to me why so much of ireland's home grown cinema has been so appalling perhaps because by its very nature those talented in the field of irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in britain or america colin farrell is a recent case in point and that the really successful irish directors that have continued to work in ireland and with irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market i am thinking particularly of jim sheridan and neil jordan who alternate between films with an irish setting and projects filmed abroad br br however is very much an irish film even if two of its principal actors are english it's certainly well made of its kind and might have bucked the trend that irish films aren't really very good paddy breathnach's i went down written by the brilliant young playwright conor mcpherson is a crucial exception unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious irish town presumably in the north of ireland judging by the accents mid ulster bible belt if you ask me and presumably in the recent past the fifties the sixties is so over the top that it really is quite ridiculous br br nothing in the film rings true and you can't help feeling it's writer has been strongly influenced by flannery o'connor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the american bible belt and not in ireland where even the most extreme protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this it's all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is though i was more prone to giggles than at the right reverand matthew antics he has the ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of daniel mays as his brother gerard as his father or eva as mays' wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film so rather than a step up the ladder for irish cinema is i'm afraid just another nail in its coffin
<START> the outsiders is undoubtedly a classic australian tv series well defined characters tight scripts varied and interesting locales great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one br br sadly andrew keir has passed on sascha from germany does not appear unfortunately to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country the abc has repeated the series many times yet a dvd release is yet to happen br br the series is one which is timeless it is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day come on abc release the outsiders on dvd
<START> i am and have been a serious collector of christmas related movies tv shows holidays specials etc for over twenty five years please heed my warning and do not be mislead by sterling reviews media hype about this movie this is not a movie as we have come to know them and is certainly not for children the fact that this was produced for a major tv network is was no surprise considering their level of operation at this time what is hard for me to believe is that the jim henson organization stooped so low to become involved in this travesty of christmas i wish there had been reviews for me to read that would warned me before i wasted my hard earned money on this piece of trash
<START> why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre other then action i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck i just could not change the channel it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower its pretty telling that the cast imdb credits with this monstrosity apparently never worked again br br bad acting bad writing bad narration bad music bad hair bad cinematography it just goes on and on the movie really has nothing to recommend it if you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out there are a tonne of other films that won't require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards br br i hope this film didn't get money from the government for financing otherwise i'm never paying taxes again
<START> chairman of the board is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic carrot top also seen on the 1 800 collect commercials he plays a surfing inventor who comes upon a man who has a flat tire top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guy's died and has given his company to the comedian even if someone else was in carrot role it still would have been bad the jokes which are constantly rigged throughout are terrible and the idea of a romantic plot twist should have been discarded do not watch
<START> after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the drive on the left side of the street this movie is an absolute no brainer the jokes if this is the right word for it are mostly sub standard about 98 and do miss any punch line at all save the money and get drunk you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted perhaps
