<START> tourist trap is a genuinely spooky low budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans it contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fear some scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when chuck connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before its head falls off there is very little gore but the violence is quite strong for pg rated horror film the mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying david schmoeller returned to make several other genre films including puppet master and netherworld still tourist trap is definitely his best horror film so if you want to be scared give this little gem a look 9 out of 10
<START> i've never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest i have ever come i gave it a 9 there are very few movies that i truly love this however is one of them with it's gritty realism fantastic on site and it's great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when i first saw it in 1979 at that point i didn't know about prisons violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive live free i doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way i was all those years ago but i will say this if you haven't seen this movie i envy you this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the time for each of us they're different but here's to the rarest movies of them all the ones we actually love
<START> i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film the acting was fine there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children or choose to have none at all whereas dumb ass w in '04 supporters are procreating like rabbits and though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years i can see mike judge's parodied prophet coming to be as life imitating art the world is being run by idiots and it will get worse as the intelligent free thinking people become the minority and the git 'er done fans outnumber them the proof is our farce of an election br br but i digress if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city go see it i have paid my 7 50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone there are laughs there are cringes but overall this is entertaining if you have half a brain you will think to yourself how this movie though funny is spot on accurate and a tiny bit uncanny i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown as fox was the one distributing this and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think maybe i will read a book and not watch or or my balls' if our society doesn't stop the dumbing down of everything and the of the english language ahem mr bush then this really is where we are going
<START> seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible after the credits i thought hey with this cast it'll probably be pretty good didn't at all turn out that way br br lame predictable groaners terribly simply drawn characters maybe except a little ms lara's and an ending one could foresee 10 minutes into the movie and worst of all it misused a delicate theme handicapped persons for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue the handicapped person the film sympathises with the most is the one who is just faking it what kind of message is that and the film doesn't have a thought through ending at all it basically comes down to i love you doesn't matter that you acted like a prick br br to sum it up great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick
<START> i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i can't quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader he's gotten good enough to be a credible manager and that's ok br br the superhero of the movie is the mini cooper it's shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize theron's character
<START> first of three aztec mummies film is the only one that to the best of my knowledge was never completely dubbed into english the film was chopped up and used in pieces by people like jerry warren in other films he combined it with another mexican horror comedy with lon chaney to make face of the screaming werewolf and it showed up in attack of the mayan mummy and elsewhere the longest of the three films a good chunk of this film makes up the two later films which use this as a basis of flash backs the plot of this film has a scientist conducting a past life regression experiment which causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden chambers in an aztec pyramid the group as well as a sinister figure known as the bat hope to use the information to discover hidden treasure instead they discover a living mummy who has other plans long and long winded this film has way too little action to sustain its 80 minute running time worse the mummy doesn't even show up until an hour has passed probably the least of the three films its easy to see why this film was cut apart it's the only way to fashion a non sleep inducing film watching the film late last night i found myself fighting to stay awake it was a tough haul and i found that i ended up scanning to the point where the mummy showed up given the choice i'd take a pass and watch the second two films
<START> this movie is so irredeemably bad nothing about it makes it worth seeing no effects no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered oh and neither a camp or any fear does it contain do yourself a favor and go see the original friday the 13th or preferably sleepaway camp but what ever you do do not see this movie br br even michele appearance at the very beginning can't save it usually in these kinds of films you expect violence suspense and a little gore and some t a the violence was poorly executed the suspense was laughable there was no gore and the t a is plentiful in the first 5 minutes then nothing at least one of these things properly done would have at least made it watchable br br to say at least one nice thing about it buck flower is great he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up if everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun no pun intended
<START> what a great film i never knew much about buddy holly but was familiar with his lively and fun music this is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's although i never cared for gary he was fabulous as buddy holly i don't know how accurate the movie is but assume at least for the most part it is accurate which makes the movie all the more interesting the music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography i don't think i would change a thing in this film it was all good what a difference in the stars from the 50's to todays music stars how can you compare someone like buddy holly to justin timberlake or any of the other popular singers of this generation
<START> this is a classic street punk rock movie if you remember those times out on the city streets 14 years old two in the morning and nothing better to do than skate from friends house to friends house and sparking it this movie brings back old
<START> pretty lame and awful slasher about someone killing the members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a meet br br christopher george gives a hilariously over the top performance as the track team's coach i don't think anyone has ever taken track and field as seriously as chris does here not even in the olympics it's a typically divine cg performance and if you are a fan of the man the legend you should run right out and grab a copy br br but we watch slashers for the murders you know it's true not the performances and graduation day fails to deliver on most counts there is one really good kill true horror only comes during a performance by the band never heard of 'em watch graduation day and find out why
<START> i cant believe how many excellent actors can be on one show it's the realism and fine acting that makes it look real this has got to be the best comedy ever created to this day and i love seinfeld and everyone loves it is just fabulous and it seems everyone in my family agrees thats no isolated opinion of mine the whole world seems to talk about different incidents and they try to reenact them my hat off to the crew some shows have an actor that makes the whole show this plot comedy has a slew 8 of them that's what makes it so amazing some people pray for health wealth or fame i pray that the show never ends john net
<START> a man is a hotel with a partner he finds out the hotel is over insured things just get worse this film has a huge of scenes they must have been put together in sleep it jumps around from place to place it does not stay focused on anything for very long the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time the dvd sound track is horrible it takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film i have scene in a long time
<START> my tolerance for shlocky direction was overwhelmed by some of the choices in this could be really good time waster br br when the romantic intervals were of a nature to take me out of the story and into how and why did the movie maker do that mode you got to figure something is missing in there restraint and i think br br brian brown is a capable empathetic actor usually i think he didn't like the project or the people and it shows i don't remember anything the other guy did can't even picture his face br br on the other hand it doesn't have to be any good to be entertaining some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even ingenious br br i watched this movie 2 00 purchase at the vid rental place against the advice of the screenwriter i understand he was tempted to remove his name from the credits matter of pride i bet
<START> do you know what farmers spray on fields that's right manure so when the bbc decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about and farming what we got was some of the manure the bbc has inflicted upon its audience br br spoilers br br fields of gold opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist according to the right on trendy bbc all scientists are women announces a new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger then the story switches to another equally bland scene if you're going to make a thriller of any type shouldn't you open with a hook that grabs the audience doctor who was brilliant at this as was the x files while 28 days later opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory i guess someone at the bbc didn't think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance br br as the not very exciting story continues a couple of journalists one's a drunken man with morals lower than bill clinton and bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting bumped off via mercy killings it's at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by mi5 spooks and the first episode ends with the main mi5 spook getting murdered br br the second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a this is when things go totally hay wire all throughout fields of gold the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths but they're not it turns out the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the in his bedroom and the story ends via the matrix camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with thereby spreading the throughout the land br br i find it impossible to say a good word about fields of gold at the time of its broadcast i was both a member of the scottish green party and i have since renounced my time in the environmental movement but even now i am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to have the bad guy spreading a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly it's a bit like a cnd member letting off a nuke in london to warn of the dangers of nuclear war i was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being bastards while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men there's also other problems with the script especially with regard to if unlike the scriptwriters you take the time and trouble to research you'll find it's entirely different from what is seen here oh and if you set fire to diesel it doesn't explode like napalm perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles jeepers creepers structure wise whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before where as jeepers creepers only lasted about 90 minutes fields of gold lasted twice that length so is doubly irritating and illogical br br as a footnote environmentalism never makes a good theme for a thriller anyone remember those steven segal movies and it's about time tv and film producers realized this
<START> i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie i think the director filmed it in his back yard there was no real plot br br terrible script br br terrible acting br br the worst production i have ever witnessed a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard br br i don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one br br life is to short to waste your time with this movie
