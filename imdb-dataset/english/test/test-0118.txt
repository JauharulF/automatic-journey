<START> i love the so called blaxploitation films and have seen dozens some such as cotton comes to harlem shaft and hammer have excellent production values and are very entertaining while many others are very cheap and silly but still entertaining such as brotherhood of death or coffey however dolemite manages something rare for the genre it's just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining it's like blaxploitation made for very very stupid people br br years ago i saw a takeoff on the dolemite films on mad tv and unfortunately the real dolemite isn't any better like the parody the acting is just atrocious rudy ray moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood he can barely read his lines and his karate is a joke with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again as for the rest of the actors many might be even worse my favorite was the fbi guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out yet they didn't even bother to re film these scenes in fact so much of it was inept that i had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a joke br br if you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film you're wrong even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin will be disappointed the naked women in the film really do look like hard luck prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies i think looking at old people naked reeeaally old people naked is no worse than looking at these ladies and as for rudy ray he has man boobs no black super hero or anti hero should look that bad naked for goodness sakes put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written by winos br br fyi apparently there are actually sequels to this film i can't imagine watching them so you'll just have to find someone else to review them i have watched plan 9 from outer space teenagers from outer space and robot monster but i just don't think i can bring myself to see another dolemite film they are that bad
<START> the disney studios' remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever feline leading an f b i agent to a kidnapped woman christina ricci gives a churlish let me outta here performance as the cat's owner and the fed is played by doug e doug embarrassingly over the top like a human cartoon a pair of rich neurotics dyan cannon and original cat cast member dean jones are funny and the formula plot still has a little juice left in it but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious and the cat is so lifeless that it's strictly d o a br br from
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina br br the acting is pathetic i know acting is hard work and stuff but that's why it should be left to real actors watching these people act is like watching michael j fox perform brain surgery it's shaky at best br br one of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of dan gordon as chris only dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting br br the special effects in this movie were terrible the worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse it looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top but it didn't help i suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single computer from the late 80s
<START> i realize why people hate this film and i hated blair witch project so go figure this is about as staged as it gets yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real i really liked the madame storyline though it's more than likely made up but the main reason i like this film is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking kidnapping them i get chill bumps every time have to look behind me as it feels like something's there with me i know it's my imagination but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas dvd's doesn't give me goosebumps so that makes this a creepy delight not for everyone as skeptics will hate it not for gorehounds as with a pg 13 rating there is no gore and the females are very annoying you'll wish the ghosts would take them off experiment on them before it's all said done out of
<START> a few years ago while i was renting some movies i came across subspecies 4 ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it we need a good vampire gore flick that doesn't hold back but when i went back to the video store they said they didn't have any other subspecies videos unfortunately the same went for any other video store i checked out i gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and i'm hooked i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for i've been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that spot is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives nosferatu a run for his fangs br br is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone his birth rite the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture bump into a man stephan who offers to help they stay at castle where we find out that stephan is brother seduces and turns two of the girls but stephan falls for one of the girls michelle and will do anything to protect her br br subspecies is a fun series despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways more likable plus was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel like romantic vampire the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie this was also the first in the series the best part is the sequels are just as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in the dark is sure to send shivers down your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldn't resist br br 7 10
<START> i was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best the only funny character is believe it or not andy dick the timing was just horrible on most of the jokes gags and the writing was bad i mean i know its supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just did work besides this whole genre has been beaten to death already with all the austin powers movies undercover brother it just seems old it also just feels like a rip off from undercover brother which also wasn't hysterical but a lot funnier than this also for an comedy action movie the direction was kind of bland i don't know if this is going to be released in theaters but it definatley is made for tv
<START> although it might seem a bit bizarre to see a 32 year old woman play the part of a 12 year old mary pickford soon makes you forget the incongruities and simply enjoy the fun br br mary is a street kid in new york city with her own lovable gang of mischief makers whose attentions are engaged by the older william haines he was 25 at the time just on the cusp of his own screen stardom br br to give away too much of the plot would not be fair suffice it that mary is great fun to watch amply displays why she was hollywood's first and most beloved super star production values are very good with lots of extras making the nyc street scenes quite believable
<START> chucky is back but this time he is not scary a lot but he is funny br br when chucky is brought back to life in the doll of course by his old trailer trash girlfriend tiffany he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll too tiffany and chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates br br don't miss this film it is a whole lot of fun it is scary funny weird wacky and stupid all in one br br my rating 9 10
<START> in all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series homicide life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made for tv movie having said that homicide the movie is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program the movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well it's all very bitter sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide story wise i found this film somewhat lacking giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as leiutenant also det bayliss's extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but i for one never felt that it needed to be i enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after h lots had been canceled but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series now if they'd just release it on dvd
<START> ivory wayans was so funny in low down dirty shame that i had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and steven seagal didn't help much it starts off with some odd religious killings that don't make much sense to jim campbell keenan he is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but jack cole doesn't seem to be who everyone thinks he is until jack's ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well it's the same thing as all of his other movies smoke past cia involvement and now trying to be a normal cop why does steven dress up like he is from a western movie and the prayer on top of that make things a little confusing
<START> lifeforce starts in outer space where the hms churchill tracks haley's comet it's equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet unable to contact earth because of interference colonel tom steve railsback decides this is the one only chance to investigate it going outside in some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship find the remains of a bat like race of creatures three perfect looking humanoids two men chris jagger bill a beautiful woman mathilda may all of whom they take aboard the churchill thirty days later back on earth the churchill is detected on radar a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out all the crew supposedly dead the rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout london br br this english production was produced by the notorious menahem golan globus who during the early 80's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris they wanted to move into the big time signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal which were this lifeforce the invaders from mars 1986 remake the texas chainsaw massacre 2 1986 a sequel to hooper's own classic all of which flopped basically bankrupt both golan globus cannon was no more anyway despite being a commercial flop at the box office i have to say i think lifeforce is a highly enjoyable if rather silly sci fi horror when originally released into theatres back in '85 was cut down to 101 minutes by golan globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd vhs laserdisc tv although apparently hooper's original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there's even more footage out there somewhere i will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut the script by dan don uncredited rewrites by michael armstrong olaf was based on the 1976 novel 'the space vampires' by colin wilson has many extraordinary ideas it's scope is truly ambitious one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one it moves along like a rocket at heart there's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle there are also some hilarious moments in lifeforce the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where railsback ends up kissing patrick stewart many many more besides i don't know call me weird but i just thought lifeforce was tremendous fun highly entertaining in just about every way from silly character's odd dialogue strange ideas that never quite come together some terrific visuals lifeforce certainly isn't a film that will bore you br br director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has double what he had for poltergeist 1982 even he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen john the guy responsible for star wars 1977 star trek the motion picture 1979 more recently spider man 2002 was brought in to handle the visual effects generally speaking they look fabulous the sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great there's also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as of blue souls fly around everywhere there's some nudity but not much gore there are some withered corpses a few gunshot wounds the skin on someones hand peels off blood spurts from someones eyes nose ears there's a severed arm as well as some zombies the special make up effects are also generally very good i wouldn't say lifeforce is scary as such as it's more of a sci fi film than horror i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of that there is no floor as it were br br with a supposed budget of about 25 000 000 it made less than half that in it's theatrical run hasn't set the world alight on video or dvd either which is a shame because although it's a bit of a mess it's very enjoyable to watch shot on location in england well filmed in 2 35 1 widescreen the 4 3 cropped image is horrible cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on the sense of the vastness of space the alien spaceship is lost the acting is ok in a very silly film patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud nancy paul replaced olivia hussey frank finlay replaced klaus kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine down br br lifeforce is a bizarre film no two ways about it really anyone looking for something simple straight forward should look elsewhere anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci fi genre than give lifeforce a go as it's one of those so bad it's good films with some impressive effects it isn't your average run of the mill film by any means
<START> is a visually stunning film and i don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that but unfortunately the story somewhat falls flat br br the film nevertheless is very entertaining it uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non existant story the film almost works just based on it's characters and style but in my opinion leaves something to be desired
<START> well how and where do i start to describe this utter nonsense imagine the morals of a cheesy hollywood western throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something 'contemporary' this film is all package and absolutely no substance br br it starts with promise young men dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive hero worship everyone can laugh at after that it all goes downhill quicker than a with no brakes the scene involving the first gig with steel dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of i have seen in a long time the singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs will he get up and sing or will he stay there on the floor and not sing who cares by now it gets worse but i don't want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail if you watch it after this review its your own fault
<START> national lampoon's dorm daze is easily the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen the movie kazaam anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way shape or form has no idea what a good movie is and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupid br br its hard to name everything wrong with this movie first off the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple misunderstandings very well at all the acting is awful to say the least and the whole thing was poorly made any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever again br br it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two because it is so bad but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie if you want a good movie to watch go turn on anything else on television even u s a has better movies than this br br friend
