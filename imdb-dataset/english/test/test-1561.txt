<START> jean gets connery's mannerisms down pat the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him the nonchalant straightening and down of the tie the swaggering steely gait it's uncanny and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was connery's creation and not really ian fleming's character br br the cinematography is a nod to those early films the movie takes off from russia with love and thunderball mainly the main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to egypt br br it's not perfect about 20 mins in it seems a one joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day of which there were plenty and wise's the intelligence men had suspect looking men in following their heroes around too and that's going back a bit unlike sellers' clouseau or baron cohen's borat doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos he is too busy perfecting his connery mannerisms it doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song and there's no funny or serious villain like mike myers' dr evil or ricardo naked gun nemesis for the hero to go up against br br but the scene where wakes up in cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three quarters empty cinema and the whole thing looks wonderful plus you'll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen and the women are ace crumpet really hot it's a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist ken adam sets or funny gadgets routine throughly recommended
<START> i enjoy science fiction just as much as the next manÂ but what the hell was that apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film 1926 ' this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero in the year following a great war africa has become the most civilised region on earth and what was formerly europe has been designated unknown land an african explorer Â played by johnny huggins a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man if you follow me Â travels to the ruins of paris in his aircraft and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage catherine hessling then the director's wife and her primate companion perhaps the creepiest ape man costume i've ever seen the savage as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual starts showing the explorer the charleston dance which he is delighted to learn himself br br it doesn't help the film that hessling who was wonderful the following year in renoir's 'the little match girl 1928 ' isn't much of a dancer though the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony furthermore i'm quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object Â it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later on the plus side i did like the general sci fi concept behind the film and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this however why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time silly crude and quite pointless parade 1927 ' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema's most respected directors and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack but i compromised with a selection of pieces from shostakovich
<START> eric phillips don wilson is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail the tracker by the way is bent on terminating phillips the most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action flick is of course robocop and while that film had some imagination and real energy this just has a real life kickboxing champ running away from a robot the movie isn't so awful as it is just empty and repetitive the story is written in clichÃ©s and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various gunfire don wilson as usual is terrible in the lead role br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> i watched x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre guillaume depardieu a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential self destruction the story is divided into two parts Â the first depicts carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed half sister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography Â the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic adding up to a true aesthetic feast x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience
<START> the italian job is a real blast to watch it's a genuinely entertaining film something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it it's not heavy with drama or emotional hand wringing it has no cosmic statements about life and it's not violent or profane it's just a fun movie between watching the little mini coopers fly around the crowded streets of l a and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek turned crook played gleefully by seth greene i had a lot of fun watching this film br br special kudos to the background music they truly set a masterful tone for such a movie so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music i found it to be the classiest part of the film br br 8 out of 10 not awe inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office br br barky
<START> i found parts of this movie rather slow especially the first part the second part seemed to go a lot faster but it's not totally clear to me as to why one part was faster than the other i somehow managed to find it enjoyable the acting was good the writing was good yet vulgar there was also another good side to it it was easier to understand than say the godfather movies you knew who was on whose side etc all in all the movie wasn't half bad
<START> i was lucky enough to win free passes to the sneak preview of pod let me just tell you from just the previews i was excited to see it the movie absolutely rocked what i really liked about it was the fact that jb was in his element with other movies like school of rock he does namby pamby music for kids and families but this music is obviously all his br br i took my brother and sister with me to see it and we laughed basically the entire time there are a couple places where i wonder what the hell they were thinking because some items are a little disjointed but for the most part it was great a lot of the time it didn't seem like a low budget film so that is a plus br br what i was most surprised about was dave as satan that is f ing hilarious you honestly wouldn't know from seeing the film that that is him br br i say that if you are a rock fan and are into jb and or tenacious d go see the film be prepared for a lot of drug references a lot of four letter words and some skull shredding rock
<START> based on an actual story john boorman shows the struggle of an american doctor whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss a holiday to burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all but when her passport was stolen in she could not leave the country with her sister and was forced to stay back until she could get i d papers from the american embassy to fill in a day before she could fly out she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide i tried finding something in those stone statues but nothing stirred in me i was stone myself br br suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him with no thought of herself continually her life was in danger br br here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous selfless charity risking her life to save another patricia arquette is beautiful and not just to look at she has a beautiful heart this is an unforgettable story br br we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps
<START> this movie coming from turkey where you can't find any tradition of horror movies first i was afraid of watching just an adaptation but after seeing it i have changed my mind it has original scenario a love movie using horror thema most of the players are not famous young people but their performance is that a new generation is coming maybe this is a sign that turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years
<START> there are other reviews here expressing similar views but i still feel impelled to add my comments the film is generally well made from a technical point of view apart from possibly being too long the acting is mostly very good although kevin spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation apparently ambition rather than racism and sandra bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy which she admittedly manages very well br br at a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it however it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew i haven't read the book so i don't know how much of that is down to grisham the biggest problem as many others have said is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice aside from the fact that i don't agree with that position i don't think that such a view actually helps the anti racist cause at all it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims at the end the prosecutor invites the jury and the audience to imagine that the raped girl was white but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists in the end the message seems to be that it's ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough it's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case br br samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance but unfortunately this also undermines the plot he comes across as someone with considerable integrity but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea and indeed he doesn't when push comes to shove we're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter although if you blink you might miss it why not take it given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim or if he wants to make a stand in court why plead insanity br br there are less serious flaws too the medical experts on whose testimony the case supposedly rests are jokes both are discredited for highly implausible reasons and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say and shouldn't be believed the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible but still a bit convenient and what if he had died i find it hard to believe that the kkk would march down the street in broad daylight other apparently serious crimes riot arson kidnapping attempted murder go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them and the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous br br my final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty as though i must be a racist because i disagree with the resolution it may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end the film did make me think about my views read what other people thought here and add my own opinion so at some level maybe it succeeded but i worry that it may have re highly views in some people which i hope is the opposite of what it intended br br final thought try watching law and order it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time
<START> this is not a good movie at all i cannot believe that after fifty years this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored this is a very overrated movie that got very very lucky it was given the national award harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience anyone with even a marginal understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars br br i cannot understand where to start there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie br br the topic chosen is great it is important that such movies be made Â but only by people who are able to handle them sawant does not measure up to the task Â not even close his direction is jumpy confused there is no clear thought process he tries but is not able to explore the depth of the characters especially the grandfather he is not able to show the initial horror anxiety and then hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together he is trying to cram in everything without any priorities he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against him br br however the cast does not help sawant either worst job Â she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job how did she get extremely lucky and or extremely influential and or extremely pitiful casting having said that she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie her act of the should have gone to the more responsible actor Â sonali kulkarni did not understand it work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm strong exterior as this is reassuring to the patients seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working for br br second worst Â i have never seen a more wooden face in marathi film industry it is abound and everywhere in today's hindi cinema though he is the producer and so he chose himself no second thought no consideration any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producer's to do it but would not let anyone else do it over ambitious and obtuse he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills my choice for this role would be br br the music is uninspired the movie is technically lacking it could well have been an project job br br on the up side brilliant performance by it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance he put many of today's actors to shame unintentionally maybe but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance also kulkarni really gave a very believable performance really put in all his efforts and it shows the script too is well written br br budget' cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie lack of funds dogs all of the marathi movies cricket and hindi movies sponge all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scraps it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out 'doghi' was brilliant movie and it too was made on a shoestring budget 'doghi' also lacked technically but it was well researched and well made it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema why did it not receive the accolades it so very deserved Â only proves my point of biased judgment br br lack of research and not of funds is what makes such a bad movie
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it was edgy without being sociopath vin diesel brought the riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels br br i also saw iron giant and vin is perfect the movie oh yeah it's called triple x or xxx was a weak example of his work in pitch black he plays an anti hero to the max i don't think you can go wrong when vin stars in a movie unfortunately might type cast him as an adventure action movie star wrong i think the script for xxx was weak for which vin couldn't act down to it br br anyway pitch black is a great scifi see it br br zafoid
<START> this movie was nothing like the book br br everything was mixed up or changed most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book br br this movie never should have been viewed it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing br br i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j d br br honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is
<START> starts as unemployed martin sanders andres hears something strange on his phone he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named diana arranging to meet her soon after martin reads a local paper sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered thinks back to what he heard martin confides in his friends laura virginia lustig aaron oliver kolker but they don't believe him then shortly after the same thing happens again the phone call the man the prostitute her death reported in the papers martin decides he has to find the killer put a stop to his killing spree but who is it br br this argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days why so long on a budget of about 3 000 why so much was written directed by sergio i cannot believe some of the glowing comments has on the imdb out of 195 user ratings as i write this of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10 i am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 if a score for a film on imdb is fixed then this is it i honestly don't believe that if you showed to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect no way on earth the user comments are also amazingly positive all by imdb users who have only wrote comments for one film this the one user besides me who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right everyone is entitled to an opinion but i would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up where do i start how on earth can i adequately describe how bad is the plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it's terrible twists while most twists turn a plot on it's head alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever relevant way are genuine surprises here in the twists destroy the first half of the film makes it utterly pointless in a 'it didn't actually happen' sort of way the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers what made martin go mad why did he imagine the phone calls why did he imagine a killer why did he imagine the newspaper headlines no explanation is given for martin's behaviour during the first hour or so of the film there's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind that's it that's all the exposition there is then there's a plot twist about martin's missing wife her lover before martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason i am sorry but is so bad it's so boring it's so badly written thought out that i honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it sorry guy's but that's how i feel quite simply is one of the worst films i have ever seen is a complete mess both conceptually technically br br according to the imdb was hot in just eight days to be honest it doesn't feel like that at all nope it feels more like it was shot in five days the whole film is an eyesore has probably the worst nighttime shooting i have ever seen it's like no attempt was made to light the scenes it's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything the scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft becomes increasingly irritating this strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring noticeable there's no real horror or scares in fact i would say is more of a thriller than a horror as far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge a knife is stuck in someones mouth nothing else br br according to the imdb this had a budget of about 3 000 which makes one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window we should accept any old crap wrong to watch this on dvd you will still have to pay good money i personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product if this can get released praised like it's oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage including embarrassing karaoke footage scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap win top prizes at the next cannes film festival the acting is awful although the female lead virginia lustig is actually rather sexy helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit br br is an absolutely terrible film seriously i beg you don't be fooled by all the fake positive comments there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10 an amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through sorry but that's the way i see it sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind you have been warned
<START> dogtown and z boys br br summary dogtown and z boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in venice dogtown california as we know it today with their low pivotal style they embarked on a larry influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures after the dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated skateboarder magazine the sport was revamped and the members of the skateboard team forgot about jeff ho and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars the original skateboard team put together by jeff ho owner and craig photographer included jay adams tony stacy peralta bob chris cahill shogo paul jim muir peggy the only female nathan pratt iv allen and david ray perry all of the original members except jay adams and chris cahill are still well and surfing skating jay adams at the time of the documentary was serving time on drug related charges chris cahill at the time of the documentary was last seen in mexico br br themes the themes of this documentary are kind of read between the lines but if there were a clear cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand br br other works stacy peralta writer and director has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written produced or directed most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding such as riding giants tv the bones and lords of dogtown he has also done films with a theme of growing up in america as a teenager films such as influences from yesterday to today and bloods made in america and the 70s the decade that changed television br br subjects the subjects of dogtown and z boys are the original members of the skateboard team excluding chris cahill peralta included jeff ho and craig in the interviews other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts skaters from the dogtown area but not on the team were interviewed br br editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion there were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions sean penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film the film was presented chronologically from the time the surf team was put together to creating the skateboard team to all of the z boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company br br cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way the film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the z boys surfing or skating were in color of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film the interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears but all were outside all of the footage was very well controlled even the archival footage which i found very surprising br br music seasons of wither performed by toys in the attic performed by generation landslide alice cooper one way out performed by the brothers lollipops and roses and whipped cream performed by herb alpert into the void and paranoid performed by black sabbath godzilla blue oyster cult aladdin sane and rebel rebel david bowie the gut feeling devo i'll give you money peter funk 49 james gang rider and foxy lady and freedom and bold as love jimi hendrix sidewalk surfing jan and dean achilles last stand and hot on for nowhere led zeppelin six underground the sneaker pimps the lively ones cat scratch fever and motor city madhouse and wang dang sweet ted nugent us and them pink floyd bad boys the pretenders maggie may rod stewart i wanna be your dog and gimme danger the stooges children of the revolution t rex bad reputation thin lizzy disco inferno the tramps hannah rob rocky mountain way joe walsh old man neil young la grange zz top br br the music in the film make the movie every one of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not have been called to mind otherwise
