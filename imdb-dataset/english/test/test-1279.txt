<START> saying this movie is worse than on your own diarrhea is a generous understatement the only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of garbage of a movie is the getting paid by the producers to register a bunch of accounts to post fake appraise br br if watching a poorly acted suspenseless snoozer of a movie about sloth from the goonies kill people in a fashion that completely ignores every law of physics pulling on an unrestrained person's legs causing them to be ripped from the torso is your idea of a good movie then knock yourself out br br no carbon based with a functioning lobe would consider in a million eons that this movie is scary or entertaining
<START> instead watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid 1960's in the ghettos of chicago for all of you out there under the age of 50 what's happening was a light hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years 1975 1979 concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood i liked it a great deal it just has no real connection to this film cooley high started out as being the basis for what's happening but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences so it was redone as a comedy even though the credits on what's happening still read that it was based on this movie br br this film starts out light but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960's and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless the guys deal with sex betrayal hopelessness and even early death the ending is quite powerful and serious and the film has a great motown soundtrack highly recommended unfortunately this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either
<START> no this is not an ed wood movie angora love is stan laurel's and oliver hardy's last silent movie the end of an era in the laurel hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly this present day br br it's a shame that this movie is however not among their best br br the premise of the movie sounds good and is good the boys team up with a goat this time which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch it however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable the comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable br br of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent laurel hardy entry br br 7 10
<START> i hired this movie out from my local movie shop not really expecting anything to flash or fancy since it was a b grade movie made on a very tight budget the opening scenes of the film were rather original and so was the plot and thats what made me hire the movie out however the film becomes very boring and frustrating at points the story had plenty of holes in it and the acting had its fair share of disappointments as well by the end of the film i was praying that a higher power was going to strike me down where i laid as i was extremely bored but more importantly frustrated with how the story turned out i still don't understand what actually happened and i don't particularly care in conclusion the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell his domain was used as a basis for such a crappy film
<START> oh i'm mostly not the kind of person to give a movie less than 5 points mostly just because of the effort from actors and directors br br 3 10 for from me if anyone thinks the main character or whoever deserves an oscar i deserve the for peace br br seriously i can't believe this movie made it to europe the acting was horrible the plot was awful and what about the '70's horror music give me a break br br popeye eg what about him why is he there he has nothing to do with the movie br br and what about the talking one time he can't say a decent word the next time he's getting all talky talk he also nearly dies when he wakes up and some sunlight shines thru his bunker but when he's walking down the street the sunlight doesn't seem to do anything br br watch this movie only of you're on the edge of dying of boredom i regret myself for not watching my roses grow which are in anyway more entertaining than this piece of
<START> sometimes it's hard to be a pirate but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying and it shows particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with mr thomas gomez eminently when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m tourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time it was an exciting entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions hidden meanings or alternative agenda it was fun m louis is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the but it is miss peters who stays in the memory wilfully adolescent illiterate tough but vulnerable wonderfully agile and ultimately courageous she is everybody's idea of a lady pirate there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret
<START> the worst movie ever hardly this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen it has appearances from all the great characters from the animated tv series rainbow very safe for small children and the colors capture their attention like no other there is an evil princess trying to steal the diamond planet which would in turn cause all life on earth to cease this tells the tale of how rainbow and her new friend are able to stop the evil plot and restore life and color back to earth it's proof that kids can make a difference rainbow will live on forever
<START> it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs that is impossible to think that tarantino's films weren't a source of inspiration to this thursday however for a low cost b series movie it's not bad the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction the resources weren't many fore sure but the film is well produced the acting also is good i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor it was hot and funny at the same time the soundtrack is nice too i didn't hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked i score it 7 10
<START> the acting was terrible the cheesy fake cheap green screen effects were ridiculous and the creatures were absolutely retarded the only good thing about this movie was the concept and the laughs i got from watching such a bad movie then i became pretty angry because i realized i wasted 4 bucks on renting it why would a movie like this ever be in theaters i know this movie came out almost 5 years ago but does anyone put any effort into making movies anymore i am just writing random things to fill up space because i need ten lines of text in order to publish this review this next line should just about do it there
<START> decent but overrated dramatic thriller film attempts to depict the spiraling out of control inner demons of a tormented artist the problem is not a single relationship illustrated on screen is believable and plausibility appears to have been thrown out the window the title character is so difficult to relate to making it's rather impossible to imagine any of the on screen characters emotionally invested in him either the conclusion is also fairly predictable there are certainly enough clues provided from the get go to indicate exactly where the story is headed choosing to entirely suspend one's belief in the situations or the relationships the film itself is well acted especially by the leads and manages to create some nice tension as the story unfolds as a metaphorical feature there is some food for thought and had the script been stronger there's certainly potential here that could have been put to better use
<START> ever sense i was a kid i have loved this movie i have always been a fan of joseph the kid had pure talent in both this movie and jurassic park i have been looking for the dvd or vhs to purchase at a store near me i cant seem to find it i hope it goes on dvd well anyways great movie if anyone knows where i can find this please contact me at net also can anyone really explain what happened with bobby was her real or was he fake and was he mikes imaginary friend and his escape lol i'm clueless my favorite part had to be definitely where they made the monster juice and spilled it all over the kitchen its funny but also a sad part as well because of what happens to bobby due to the mess i would've liked to see the boyfriends face because he played his part pretty good i think the mother was a great actress i think her name is lorraine bracco or some sorta name like that well thats all please contact me br br
<START> i didn't know anything about this movie before i watched it it seems to be a lesser known teen horror from the 80's what struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era br br the first thing i noticed was how slowly this movie builds it doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one it takes its time building the back story leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen i was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie but everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes and then it gets fairly graphic this was a bad time to take a snack break i almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started br br the characters also seem slightly more three dimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks there conversations were refreshingly level headed for the most part as opposed to the over the top stereotypes you'd expect for example the girl who is the popular snobby queen bee of the clique isn't constantly spouting insults at everyone but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others br br so to summarize i felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what i expected and a little better made as well it drew me in kept me interested and then let me have it as i said it's pretty gory during the finale but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time i don't need to own it but i'm glad i discovered it
<START> this should not have been made into a movie everything about it was idiotic and i don't think i laughed even once there were bits and pieces that were okay i guess but that's about it a lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better there were some famous actors actresses in this but no one did a good job they must've just not cared this is one of those movies that tries to have a cute ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values carrot top is probably the worst comedian out there right now do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one br br final decisions br br movies nooooo br br purchase dvd absolutely not br br rental only if you've seen everything else and have a free coupon but even then it's still not worth your while
<START> wow this really is stereotypical terrible trash i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this br br i am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible movie br br i will now be more wary when i watch late night movies br br this is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i don't think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scary movie series look intelligent br br 1 10 i'd give it a 0 if they would let me
<START> ken loach showed the world the down and out flip side of swinging london with poor cow about london woman joy carol white hooking up with a thief and having a son with him only to see the man end up in the slammer while his friend terence stamp manages to help her out some he proves to be little better in what a loser he is it soon becomes clear to joy that she's going to have to make a serious decision about where she's going in her life br br one thing that i determined i don't know whether or not this is accurate was a use of irony in the movie her name is joy but she experiences no joy in her life even if that wasn't intended it's still a movie that i recommend to everyone featuring songs by donovan one of which colors appeared in another terence stamp movie the limey which incidentally came out in 1999 when i was as old as my parents were when poor cow came out
