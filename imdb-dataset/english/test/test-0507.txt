<START> me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day we picked one each and one of us picked lets just say that from now on we never let him pick a movie this movie sucks
<START> is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating because this one deserves it while i'm not a big fan of jane austen's books i sat through this one with two women who are well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is robert hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing though he overdid it as he usually does nearly as bad as william shatner but that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total it's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is really happening and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax the lead actress is too ditsy and weird looking to be a heroine the leading man is too goofy looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter i mean saxophone mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing so in conclusion i suggest you blow the budget and order a dvd of this one as soon as possible especially if you like disappointment
<START> this is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie i have ever seen it's been a long time since i've seen it but the jokes are not funny the plot is painfully forseeable calling the main characters stupid is to vastly upgrade their intelligence uggh i just wanted to punch tom arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when i was done watching this piece of cinematic filth i don't even know why i ever wanted to watch it but remember if you see this movie don't say i didn't warn you br br ps tom arnold's character sings a song in this movie called i'm my own grandfather nuff said
<START> ernst lubitsch gave us wonderful films like design for living ninotchka the shop around the corner to be or not to be and other wonderful films but people usually put eighth wife as one of lubitsch's weakest films br br but i consider this film as an important film this film began the collaboration of charles brackett and billy wilder charles brackett billy wilder and walter wrote the screenplay for ernst lubitsch's ninotchka of course lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process after that charles brackett and billy wilder worked together they together wrote the screenplay for famous films like the lost weekend and sunset blvd br br there are lots of funny moments in the film i thought the taming of the shrew was very funny there is a famous expression called films are slices of life and here is a great example from eighth wife 1938 br br at the first session of the scripting process lubitsch posed this question how do the boy and girl get together billy wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store the boy is trying to buy a he but he sleeps only in the tops he is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops the clerk says he must buy the pants too it looks like a catastrophe then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants ernst lubitsch and charles brackett were enchanted it wasn't till months later they discovered that billy wilder himself is a tops only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it br br i got this information from a book i think this film can be considered as the return of ernst lubitsch right after this film he made wonderful films like ninotchka the shop around the corner and to be or not to be br br i thought gary cooper's performance was good i think lubitsch casted gary cooper probably because gary cooper played long fellow deeds who inherited the fortune in frank capra's mr deeds goes to town but this is just my opinion br br as for me i highly enjoyed the film i rate this film 9 out of 10 lubitsch films are different because his films are slices of life
<START> i absolutely despise this film i wanted to love it i really wanted to but man oh man they were so off with sara and the father living was pretty cheesy that's straight out of the shirley temple film br br i highly recommend the book it is amazing in the book sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing because it is right she doesn't have a spiteful bone in her body br br in the film she is mean spirited and spiteful she does little things to get back at miss in the book sara is above such things she does stand up to miss she tells the truth and is not cowed by her but she does not do the stupid spiteful things that the sara in the film does br br it's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie i can't help but wonder did we read the same book the whole point of the book was personal responsibility behaving with honor and integrity always telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity br br sara has a happy ending in the book not the ridiculous survival of her father but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her in the book she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and becky and miss is not a chimney sweep that part of the film really was stupid br br to see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me we are praising a film that glorifies petty spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity i don't even recognize her in the film she's not in it br br good thing mrs burnett isn't alive to see this horrid thing it's ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book
<START> we see a man move from city to out back and change dramatically his family asks questions but he goes mad br br strange brilliant film for screening here in israel wonderful locations great actors a film which masquerades as a thriller but which is more a case study of madness in the lead man br br the film was way above the other films screened as part of the festival here in israel best of luck to the team who arrived at this film it's a grand guignol a little masterpiece of noir br br my only criticism which prevents a 10 is that the sound and the music is overpowering at times it tends to get in the way of the images which speak for themselves
<START> my favourite movie of all time this was a flawed piece of work by coppola and seeing the documentary 'heart of made it even more compelling coppola at this point was king of hollywood after making 'the godfather' and and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'apocalypse now' through sheer arrogance he went to the phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there just as captain willard thought he would know what to do once he got to col compound and just like willard he didn't know what he was going to do once he got there this is such a masterpiece of american cinema beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story what i like most about 'apocalypse now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions consequently because of this open it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious br br this movie defies some call it a war movie which it isn't at all really it is more of a personal study of man the best pic about vietnam is in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the vietnam war go there first for answers br br coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with gen corman and lucas harrison ford and the playmate review the sheer audacity of makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a hollywood classic br br it is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone very challenging to watch but rewarding as well i could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless this movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification br br a little footnote definitely if your a first time viewer of apocalypse now watch the original version first the version is i think more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and version of the movie
<START> great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years great production design appealing stars great lines miss bender i don't care if you beat it out on a native drum says joan crawford's amanda farrow to hope lange when lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time if you've seen this movie panned and scanned on tv and not in the letterboxed version on pay tv or amc american movie classics you haven't really seen it hopefully this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on dvd in a letterboxed version and with it's original 4 track stereophonic soundtrack great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 new york while johnny mathis sings the best of everything theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of background miscarriages insanity office romance bitchy cold hearted bosses thwarted love it's all here to enjoy
<START> this is pure crap and probably the worst biblical theme film ever absolutely inaccurate i mean they've put and before the great flood they've described lot as a friend of noah although he lived after noah to make things worse later lot became a pirate and attacks noah's ark during the flood and what's with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism and exchanges alcohol for a food and water and then noah is portrayed as alcoholic mockery and continuous one after another and it goes on and on and on film maker and all participants surely secured themselves the front row in hell with this garbage br br please stay off this crap because you will save yourself nearly three hours of your life
<START> in a better civilization this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters the plots are fabulous no i'd no clue who had done it but the clues were all there if i'd been more imaginative the best kind of mystery the production values astounding the acting from edward fox sarah miles lysette anthony megan dodds and of course david suchet as hercule poirot simply perfect the dialogue wonderful the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff br br one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them here were have two the sexy sinuous megan and the stunning lysette anthony br br you really can't go wrong renting these they're just wonderful like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything and the settings gorgeous br br i can't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot david suchet movies it's impossible to over praise them and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie
<START> i enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline all the main characters are well cast true john wayne or robert mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but victor mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling tarzan of sorts reminds me of his film role as samson another difficult but not impossible man to tame br br the mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts this story supposedly takes place in oregon just before the end of the civil war judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene probably mt the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the as we never see any other civilians however there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of wyoming or montana red cloud the war chief who threatens the and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865 66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in wyoming and montana fort laramie eastern wyoming is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort the plains tribe of is mentioning as joining red cloud this aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical fact br br it may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of john ford's fort apache in both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with native american problems he underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career in both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local native americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do in both films we have a budding romantic between a woman very close to the heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion br br i also see certain resemblances with the misfits the soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sort as one of them admits mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting native americans the wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army the in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army generated antagonism by red cloud br br finally we can also compare this story with anthony mann's later film the far country starring jimmy stewart in stewart's case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end but mature's character doesn't come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss red cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate besides he has an obsession with the wife
<START> this is one of those films that looks so dated that being that way is part of the fun you see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today some of that is good some it too corny for words some of it bad depending on your viewpoints on certain cultural issues br br for instance in this short 68 minutes 1931 film you have br br the grandpa of the family that is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the united states picture that in today's films br br a district attorney walter huston almost begging for death penalty sentences and the populace shown as supporting it 100 percent once again picture that in modern day movies br br along the way you have some shocking violence such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet and his father being picked up and swung repeatedly head first into a wall this is a tough stuff to say the least br br yet the film is dotted with comedy mostly by the patriotic grandpa memorably played by charles chic sales there are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film and for soft touches there are the two young boys one of whom dickie moore went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day here he is just a little tyke of about 5 years of age who understandably is far from being a polished actor but you can see stardom for him on the horizon in fact he did just that the following year with a solid performance in blonde venus starring marlene dietrich br br anyway this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence comedy and sentimentality and it has a nice feel good ending and a thought provoking message it was up for an academy award too for best writing original story i am sorry to say it is only available for viewing on cable tv as it has never been put out on vhs or dvd and that's a shame
<START> mario from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk i had to go through midnight video who have a swedish branch i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only a title br br this film goes under many a k a's depending on when and where it is marketed i had previously purchased the bloodsucker leads the dance which you will find if you search on imdb under people and input krista nell the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice i smiled when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the in the subject film my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious krista nell br br there are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail extortion sleazy affairs with mothers a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit a by a client's motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by transvestites etc which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word sleaze but artistic sleaze the aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their wheres and personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places e g the scene of the dancing transvestite krista nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and i was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplay br br i love the political incorrectness shown in older films this is 30 years from its making e g smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office i would suggest 4 10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such
<START> i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv uninterrupted by commercial breaks i've liked lee van cleef in many movies but i'm afraid that having the other characters call him chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of yul chris br br i found this movie to be a complete disappointment the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original the rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film i guess if you haven't seen the original it would be okay too many clichÃ©s and too little depth to the characters i missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original
<START> i saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting i saw the imdb rating and 6 8 confirmed it to be an above average movie thus went to see it br br the story is about mandy lane amber heard Â a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire mandy's friend michael welch provocation to another fellow student to show his love for mandy leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death nine months pass and mandy is invited for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch by her teenager friends Â three girls and three boys go there there is a security guard garth mount who works at the ranch during the first night itself the killings take place Â one by one the members of the group are killed who is behind the killings i wont tell here to spoil did i like the movie no after usual interesting opening Â the movie takes a downward turn with every unfolding of event by half time when the killer is revealed one looses all interest in the remaining proceedings there is a last twist in the tale to shock viewers but rather it made me shake the head in dis belief and laugh all this for suspense amber heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl Â who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her the remaining cast are usual Â nothing to say about there are so many movies made of teenager boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one Â that it does not interest me anymore br br director jonathan levine tries hard to make the movie interesting by using contemporary chat talks of teenagers loaded with sexual overtones but does not allow the movie to rise above the mundane br br the only and the most appealing saving grace of the movie is its cinematography by darren Â who captures beautiful picture perfect images stars 3 out of 10
