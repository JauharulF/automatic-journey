<START> the last film of john huston the great american director of the irish descent is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection dubliners of the greatest writer ever came from ireland the film is a family affair the dying director made it based on the script adapted by his son tony huston from one of the most poignant beautiful and profound short story ever written in this language and considered by many the best english language short story john directed his daughter anjelica in what could be her finest screen performance the film is short only 83 minutes it's got no action sequences no plot it is almost non eventful and it may seem slow the guests friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in dublin during the epiphany week in january 1904 at the house of two elderly sisters who give annual dinner with music and dance what viewers see for the first hour is the ensemble conversation piece the guests talk listen to the music discuss the latest opera premiere and make jokes sometimes awkward gradually the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away br br this is the film you have to stay with let it pull you in listen to what and how the guests at the party say how they communicate pay attention to the body languages to the looks at their faces when they drift away from the light laugh and music of the present to the long gone but never in fact left most precious memories where the dead of the title are not dead but forever young and so alive if you do you will be awarded with the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you it will break your heart to pieces pull them together and put it back transfixed the film as well as joyce's story centers on gabriel conroy donal mccann as james joyce's alter ego gave a very moving understated performance as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife gretta anjelica huston gabriel is still in love feels close connection to and fascinated with her it is after the party he discovers that even after many years of closeness he does not know all about her past her pains her regrets and the unforgettable emotions and loss she had lived through as a young girl and he is no part of for the first time he looks at her and thinks of her not as the indelible part of his existence but as another human being with her own inner world her own loneliness and sadness and for the first time a strange friendly pity for her entered his soul it is he who narrates the final most powerful and profound lines of the story snow is general all over ireland falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead br br if you have not seen the film or read the joyce's story please do they are truly the works of art that leave the everlasting impression and would change something in you to the best
<START> lloyd hamilton was one of the most imaginative and among the funniest of all the silent film comedians why is he utterly forgotten unfortunately the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the fox warehouse burnt in the early 1930s hamilton was not handsome or graceful like chaplin keaton and lloyd nor was he dapper like raymond griffith and unlike harry langdon and again chaplin hamilton did not try for audience sympathy br br however his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release and they remain hilarious today oscar levant once claimed that he asked chaplin if there was any other comedian whom he'd ever envied and chaplin instantly named lloyd hamilton the character most frequently portrayed by hamilton on screen a flat capped naff with fastidious hand gestures and a duck like walk was later adapted by vaudeville comedian eddie garr teri father and further adapted by jackie gleason as his 1950s tv character 'the poor soul' br br 'the movies' directed by roscoe arbuckle is one of hamilton's most innovative shorts and it's hilarious we first see him as a country boy bidding farewell to his family outside their homespun cottage on his way to the big city then he steps away from the cottage and we see that it's in the big city with traffic booming all round him br br eventually our hero ends up at a restaurant uncredited but it's the montmartre cafe in downtown l a where all the movie actors eat between takes there's an amusing gag when hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as presidents washington lincoln and roosevelt this gag would have been funnier if the looked more like the originals finally our lad seats himself at a table hoping to meet a celebrity sure enough entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star none other than lloyd hamilton there's a very well made double exposure shot the join is nearly invisible when lloyd hamilton as himself greets lloyd hamilton as the country boy br br sadly hamilton's peak period of creativity was very brief he began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act ham and bud opposite bud duncan and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period sound movies were not kind to hamilton and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early talkies then he died young fortunately 'the movies' is quite funny and a splendid introduction to this unique comedians' style i'll rate it 7 out of 10
<START> i really wanted to love this film i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it the book is marvelous this film is very far from the book the book is splendid this film is an awful adaptation br br in the book sara is honorable kind strong and never does anything spiteful to get back at anyone that's the point of the book she behaves as a princes regardless of circumstances an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness it is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated br br in the book she endures much and touches the lives of others other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and sara does what is right simply because it is right br br outside of the bakery she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is she has half a dozen hot buns she is very hungry she gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery when she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun she gives her another she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think i don't remember how many br br the baker is watching through the window she is so moved by what she has witnessed she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter other people are similarly influenced by sara br br and in the book her father has died the man next door is her father's partner he has been looking for her her father did not lose his money after all the man is thrilled to find sara he takes her and becky into his home and raises them as his daughters and sara has her full inheritance of course br br miss is not a chimney sweep in fact she remains in her same post at the school but she is humiliated as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received and sara does speak to miss in the end miss is trying to minimize her treatment of sara and sara with a calm steadfast demeanor instructs miss that she had been cruel br br there is no comeuppance for miss she continues on in her miserable existence it does not matter what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her and her dearest friend in the world becky is now for all intents and purposes her sister br br the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances it is about self control and humility it is a wonderful book this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book my wife was so disgusted with it she wanted to leave the theater in the middle but we decided to stick it out we were not rewarded br br i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in i don't know but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it br br don't waste your time buy the book it is unforgettable even for a dad
<START> the incident is set in arizona where six death row inmates are being transfered from the state prison for reasons never explained while driving along the heavily armed prison bus gets a flat the driver is forced to pull off the road then two blonde birds turn up after seducing the incompetent prison guards manage to get the better of them the six prisoners are released but in a shoot out their getaway car is damaged leaving them all stranded in the middle of the arizona desert they decide to head to the nearest town several miles away take the cops with them as hostage once they reach they find it odd that the place is completely deserted with not one single other person in sight they soon discover that the entire town has been killed by flesh eating aliens they are firmly placed on the menu br br also known as alien invasion arizona in the us on dvd apparently having the working title terror town this rubbishy low budget sci fi horror flick was co written co produced directed by dustin has no real redeeming features at all to be frank the incident is the sort of film which gives films a bad name the film could roughly be divided into two parts the opening forty or fifty odd minutes focuses on the prisoners in a thriller feeling opening the guards the escape although it's pretty poorly written staged stuff the dialogue between the two blonde birds the prison guards is so bad it's unintentionally funny as the two fit birds chat up the two not so fit prison guards funny stuff actually unfortunately the incident is supposed to be a sci fi horror film not a comedy then once the escaped cons their prison guard hostages arrive at it goes into sci fi horror mode as the aliens turn up start killing our clichÃ©d character's off which is good because they are annoying look the whole film sucks as it's badly written thought out made i can't really be bothered to go into why but trust me the incident is awful on every level br br as well as being just a bad boring stupid film the incident is also poorly made the action set piece scenes are awful the aliens looks terrible are never shown on screen at the same time as the human character's as such it's sometimes difficult to tell what's happening the special effects are poor too the aliens look rubbish the cgi computer effects are absolutely terrible as well the editing is poor the cinematography is poor the sets are cheap the whole thing is just an eyesore really there's a bit of gore there's some gunshot wounds someone is ripped in half a severed hand is seen br br obviously shot on a low budget the incident has low production values looks cheap from start to finish filmed in superior in arizona the acting is terrible from no one i have ever heard of although the actress who plays the female doctor is pretty good looking br br the incident is a rubbish sci fi horror film that is terrible in just about every way not worth 90 minutes of yours mine or anyone else's time
<START> if you liked william hickey in prizzi's honor he resurrects his character as don anthony in mob boss this is a very weak godfather satire with few laughs stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he's doing in this schlock fest morgan performance is one of the better efforts in the movie and that alone is not a good sign for sure eddie vacillates between three stooges slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation fatally flawed mob boss is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense merk
<START> i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation last year at marienbad comes to mind well x ain't no last year at marienbad i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years x achieved membership in that august group in my defense i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground hoping things would turn around however i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark quite respectable under the circumstances x does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work after a 10 year hiatus that must have been bitter for him indeed melville is still spinning in his grave
<START> it had its moments but overall when i watched this cartoon as a child i was bored out of my mind the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a cartoon probably my first exposure to anime it is also one of my least favorite anime's i remember others one involving a giant ship in space that made no sense but was more enjoyable because they were in space i also remember one with these people dressed like birds that was a bit strange but more entertaining i do not really like car racing though at all did not then and still do not so that is probably one of the reasons i did not care for this show even though today i am an avid anime fan the characters were a bit goofy too and then there was the horrible scenes where virtually no action was taking place that was probably used to cut down on animation costs and to pad the show the gadgets in the cars were cool though and provided some entertainment for me back then overall i find this show to be rather unwatchable compared to newer animes and some from the same era but this is just a personal opinion i am sure many other reviewers love the show which is cool
<START> spoilers spoilers wow what a predicament joanna has found herself in after accidentally running over a young child she goes to call for help only to return to the crime scene amidst a group of very angry onlookers this is too much for her to handle and she flees the scene luckily the child didn't die but is seriously injured and in a coma so starts the biggest struggle in life should she keep quiet or speak up at first she doesn't but eventually she realises that it's torture living with such a horrible secret br br at one point she even joins a search party to help find the culprit and gradually a detective starts to question this woman's behavior she wants to tell the truth and she never meant to run away from the crime scene but is it worth telling and having the whole town hate you for it br br the thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides joanna is very much a good role model even though she's made some wrong choices you feel for her even though you know what she did was wrong her journey is a good representation of what any human being would go through if something like this were to happen to them br br margaret colin is an absolutely brilliant actress she was amazing in the tv series now and again and great in films like independence day and the devil's own her performance here is so realistic and unforced that she carries us singlehandedly through the entire film in the end i wanted to see more of her lisa vidal also provided some good supporting work as the gentle resourceful detective br br to wrap it up if you wanna see a movie that will make you think long afterwards one that will say this is reality then you won't want to miss this one br br my rating 9 10
<START> seriously this film is not steve guttenburg is constantly forcing his tough guy dialogue and then giving everyone the evil eye all the time he just wasn't believable he seems like he's trying to be a badass and he sucks at it i just remember him as the millionaire dad with the olsen twins in it takes two so this is a big change i rented this film for sean bean and he dies as usual only this time he didn't get impaled on a boat anchor patriot games smashed by a giant satellite dish goldeneye or get run over by cows the field he just got shot real quick like and civil and that was all i got from this film that they didn't kill him off in an extremely grotesque and morbid way how sad is that i was only watching it for the 3 seconds that sean was in it and then the rest was rubbish i actually tried to watch and understand the plot but there really wasn't one seemed a little like mission impossible with the hole oooooo there's a mole it's the leader of the group and no one expected it let's trap him let's frame the underdog good guy so we can get away with it cliched and tired this movie was a waste of time
<START> olivia d'abo in a wet t shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it other than that this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody's time the writing is bad the acting is poor and the direction is sub standard
<START> this movie is on cable sporadically and i never really watched it thinking it would be similar to the bruce willis film america with the usual trite story about american freedom etc but it was not it was so much more br br of course martin sheen is excellent i have never seen him in a movie i haven't loved even if the script is bad because he is so talented kathy bates is the overbearing mom and does a great job the real surprise is emilio estevez who has not always been in the greatest films but also directed this movie please don't stereotype him from the breakfast club movie he is so much better in this and i wish he would do more non commercial atypical hollywood movies br br the film is realistic as we see emilio home from vietnam during thanksgiving kimberly williams is passable as the sister who feels she is disgraced and embarrassed by the returning soldier her brother he is quite alienated from the family and especially at this time in us history this story is very relevant br br i learned a great deal about post traumatic stress and you will genuinely empathize with this character this is not a violent journalistic portrayal like platoon for example it is more of a character study which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the effects of war especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims with today's violence it is rare that a movie causes one to genuinely feel sad and shed a tear this does it and deserves recognition
<START> when the puffy chair beckons beware of its soft colorful br br the movie starts out quite well josh mark and emily kathryn are a boyfriend girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship an argument occurs one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his father's house where josh plans to deliver a purplish for his dad's birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up josh's flighty brother rhett rhett wilkins an amish looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than his own br br the roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh convinces the original owner to refurbish it rhett quickly that the cause of all of emily and josh's problems is the and sets it to the torch one night br br and that's the last we hear of the chair even though there are many minutes left in the film br br the big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair when it isn't the chair at all that takes center stage it is josh and emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed there's never another mention of it even though they arrive at josh's parents place on his father's birthday without a gift josh never mentions the chair nor does his father there's no connection between it and the lives of these people so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isn't there a tie in with it at the end bad script br br the other annoying thing is that mark brother jay is not only the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every scene has a rapid zoom in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel but rapidly became unbearable br br the acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actors actresses did fine jobs but the poor production quality stilted ending and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems
<START> this review is based on the english language version br br orson welles' legendary unfinished epic was just that unfinished it should have been left as such not thrown together in this clumsy boring compilation of whatever material was available br br while i'm sure it was done with the best of intentions the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to welles' vision they've also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version upon audiences br br the first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances they're also inconsistent welles' original recordings using his own voice as he often did have been retained in a handful of scenes they don't match at all there hasn't been the slightest attempt at consistency add to that an extremely empty sound mix which has only a bare minimum of sound effects atmos a long sequence during a huge festival including the running of the bulls sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd that's meant to be in the thousands br br however the real problem is the unavoidable fact that 'don quixote' was incomplete it's glaringly obvious from watching this the film consists of a handful of scenes strung together dragged out to ridiculous lengths just to make up the running time case in point the sequence where sancho searches for don quixote in the city goes on forever it's just sancho approaching people in the crowd asking them the same questions over over again there is no way that welles could ever have intended using every single take in its entirety but that's what appears here it lasts over twelve minutes when in fact it would most likely have lasted about two minutes absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film br br while the start of the film is relatively complete rather well done the rest has massive holes which simply can't be filled with endless overlay of spanish countryside still more shots of don quixote sancho going back forth there's also no ending no resolution no conclusion no punchline no point br br although there is material in private collections that was unavailable to the filmmakers that couldn't possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete coherent work welles simply didn't complete shooting largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finish br br however putting aside the fact that it wasn't complete never could be one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough unfortunately by putting it all together in such a slipshod manner one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall in particular what was clearly a terrific performance from akim tamiroff as sancho is utterly ruined with the new voice with long drawn out scenes that eventually cause him to be simply irritating br br orson welles' vision for this film was something far more ambitious complex than a simple retelling of the story of don quixote but that's what has been attempted here as such the point is lost the only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been welles himself he didn't br br the footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary chronicling the whole saga of welles trying to make the film welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a doco when are you going to finish don quixote
<START> what i miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination everything is said it is like a documentary film but not as good as a documentary because it is no documentary a patchwork film without a continuous story very superficial nothing to think about because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think i do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is quite poor the film is quite boring
<START> basic summary used to be a community of witches and escaped the salem witch hunts by forming a covenant of secrecy the first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers and must come to terms with the seductive addictive nature of using those powers br br well i usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5 going from there br br production 1 for very obvious audio out of sync 1 for nicely done special effects the darkling actually gave me chills 0 5 for nice colorization i like the dull blue 0 5 for the stupid sound track 0 5 for the opening sequence i'm a sucker for stylish compositing and flashy title design br br story script 1 for decent main idea 0 5 for matrix street fighter ripoff pastiche 1 for not explaining some plot threads very well spiders darkling 1 for boring predictable ending 1 for gratuitous exposition both as words on the screen and as bland br br acting characterization 0 5 for bad bad acting although it gets a little better as the film progresses 1 for lack of character development especially among all the females br br other 1 for gratuitous male and female nudity which is fun to watch and 0 5 for no sex scenes which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot 1 for hitting its target audience teenage sci fi horror thriller fans even though this movie is not exclusively any of those genres br br conclusion this is not a film this is a movie there's really nothing to analyze it's just good relatively clean fun lots of really attractive actors and actresses lots of boys fighting in the style of and street fighter if you like cute actors and actresses supernatural special effects and or mindlessly fun plots this movie is for you if you prefer oscar worthy exquisitely produced film masterpieces with tons of multi layered allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques you probably won't like this film br br using my twisted logic this movie gets a 4 10
