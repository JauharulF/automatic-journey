<START> like the first film in this series slaughter 1972 i think it would be a mistake to just label this a film sure slaughter is a tough gun toting black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys and a very good action picture at that br br for the second and final time jim brown plays the title character the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire no slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his 357 but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened however slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it well it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie in it slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico now in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter and because the job was bungled so badly the mob boss ed macmahon orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin don stroud in a very typical sort of role for him stroud is great scary and nasty to the core but ed macmahon as the boss wow that's an interesting twist br br slaughter is now stumped he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them they were dead so to help him along in his own private vendetta brock peters who plays a cop tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work so slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials and naturally there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process br br stroud isn't about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps girlfriend now it's a standoff slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back the lady is dead being a tough but gallant man you might just be able to guess much of what happens next br br the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss at the end he simply folded and way too quickly when slaughter catches up to him macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears and this is too much of a clichÃ© and inconsistent still despite this minor quibble it's an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs
<START> it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting it happens quite often not only is dark harbor uninteresting but it is very poorly done scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble br br some movies build tension by building the story dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it i was hoping that like other movies the suspense would finally explode it never does also the characters have no continuity from scene to scene they may act one way in one scene but then act a completely different way in another scene at first you think that they are merely out of character but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all they are just props for the final twist the final ten minutes try to be shocking instead it's rather lame and uninteresting the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long br br this isn't one of those low budget gems it's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home
<START> there is something that one of the characters the aging film director who pretends to be dead says which may summarize all the film in italy it's the dead who rule true this is a country without a future in the hands of old and jaded men and cryptic portrait of the country on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living manages to say a lot about what is not working here but foreigners may miss the point as it's not clearly expressed i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there's a meaning well there's a meaning but it's clear only to people who live here today and keep their eyes wide open like bellocchio surely it's not one of his best films and it's not as powerful as notte but it's worth seeing for italians who live in italy
<START> chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who with amnesia is mistaken for the dictator i e hitler a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost he surely wouldve been sent away to be br br a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world good fun but with a message a little preachy in the end this was the last movie with chaplin's trademark little mustache on a scale of one to ten 9
<START> i absolutely love this show its basically fox's improved version of the simpsons lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9 it's political irrational and irresistible anyone who says they don't like it is lying there is a character for every one peter quagmire are my favorites peter because he is rude obnoxious and just doesn't give a crap because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it and quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes also there is an episode for everybody too if you're the political type there is mr griffin goes to washington vol 2 season 3 if you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible vol 2 season 3 or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit janet vol 1 season2 basicly what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone
<START> this bbc series is astonishingly good fun i'd only seen a few minutes before i knew i had to own it and watch it again with all my friends i wouldn't recommend this to anyone prudish but almost anyone else is going to enjoy it from the cinema snob to the entertainment hungry masses the lead character is a lesbian but it's still worth watching if that's not your thing br br rachael stirling is incredible in a lead role that stretches her into a dazzling assortment of emotions and situations some of a bizarre nature no one who saw this series would ever say she can't act she makes us laugh cry get turned on and slap our foreheads in amazement br br you can't really compare this story to anything else it's not a rehash of style or plot it's entirely it's own comedy historical drama erotica coming of age tale musical and more br br gotta praise the bbc for making this story i can't imagine anyone in the overly prudish and formulaic u s ever doing it so stop reading about it and go buy it
<START> words almost fail me to describe how terrible this irish vanity project funded by canadian both federal and really is br br there's a sudden appearance by a nice looking canadian woman kathy who in real life was a star athlete in alberta for no other reason to ensure canadian content credits also indicate that certain calgary pubs were of assistance br br everything here is poorly filmed and at least third hand chunks of poorly digested trainspotting lock stock snatch and reservoir dogs are the most obvious steals avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of those campy so bad it's almost funny nights in front of your telly
<START> begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest this icon who has some christopher lee qualities to him then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in br br the first ten minutes is well filmed good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem but the film drags in the middle although thankfully not as much as house of death and never really gets that initial spurt of energy back br br lots of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things twice we see poisonous gas being used but the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played boy is that false advertising unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch matlock br br the general principle of the film is decent horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon a modern equivalent digging up vincent price or peter cushing would make a great film maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in application and this film offers that example br br the only redeeming quality of this film besides the beginning is the brief appearance of a very young jeffrey combs i saw him and thought that's jeffrey combs but felt i was mistaken as the box never mentioned him but sure enough combs was present a note to this movie's film makers mention combs on the cover of the dvd you'll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers if you're a jeffrey combs die hard check out this early role otherwise i cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon let me suggest intruder or popcorn as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time
<START> i loved this film it was so easy to become a part of the characters lives and really feel the emotion they were going through br br a film filled with laughs sarcasm shocks and upset just a fantastic romantic drama really br br the only part i didn't enjoy was in the special features the behind the scenes commentary was a little off putting because i'd seen the film before the extras i prefer thinking of the actors like the characters silly i know but the actors personality's are very different from the characters they play but nevertheless its a totally fantastic spectacular brilliant film i recommend that anyone who looked at this film and thought hmmmmmmm should i buy it answer must be a definite yes
<START> a swedish splatter movie has the world gone insane br br probably not but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore flicks the b movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days long gone are the golden days of i and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own it's just too much talk in it it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx which are great for a b movie the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though but that actually don't matter that much it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void br br every person who know about gert will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt though i nearly laughed my ass off it's really that hilariously bad br br besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starved for swedish b movies br br 4 10
<START> this film has it's heart in the right place but unfortunately it isn't much of a film it is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative is basically a newspaper op ed piece put on celluloid however your average well researched op ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here the filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of african life in particular the country of due to the unethical practices of the imf and world bank by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned there is an extra 10 minutes dispersed throughout the film that makes a half hearted attempt at a narrative plot and a bizarre hollywood western style shootout scene where the director seems quite pleased with his own cleverness hence the frequent godard comparisons br br of course as the film begins what and who is on trial is never explained but as we know by now the french refuse to spoon feed their audience br br there are many impassioned arguments made but they are often long winded delivered in a shrill monotone one that becomes quite easy to tune out after awhile and very light on specifics the last point is the most frustrating of all since there is a very well reasoned specific case to be made against the institutions on trial here unfortunately all we get in 2 hours is that the imf and are evil oppressors and should forgive 3rd world debt we are given no more than the occasional hint to the specific reasons why the organizations on trial are guilty but never a clear case the mock trial arguments and the footage of the surrounding village makes the suffering of these african residents clear but one wonders why we must sit through 2 hours of it when a far more precise picture could be painted in a 20 minute newsweek article or bill episode in the end there is something very important to be said on this issue it simply isn't presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious indulgent piece
<START> a vehemently cynical sarcastic and intense film mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films thursday is an entertaining off putting and hilarious thrill ride an amazingly eclectic mix of over the top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations this day in the life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantino's dark humored masterpiece pulp fiction br br nick aaron stops by casey's thomas jane house to catch up on old times casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed become an architect married a successful businesswoman paula marshall and is now contemplating adopting a child nick who still has ties to the gangster underworld leaves a briefcase full of drugs at casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few a k a unfinished business disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink that's when one at a time nick's double crossed accomplices rapping drug and crooked cops all come a knocking for the unsuspecting casey who is about to have one unbelievable thursday br br the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee after pondering which size cup to get a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free cake and uses a 50 bill to pay resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick br br the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day this effect is much like pulp fiction which is a similarly given chapters although thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback also like tarantino music magnificently introduces each scene and each character oddly humorous creatures such as the jamaican hit man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his and narcissistic dallas who attempts to rape casey add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are when mickey rourke's calmly spine chilling crooked cop is introduced the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled and casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable br br definitely a wannabe pulp fiction with plenty of violence witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists thursday does some things right but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip off a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travolta's do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far br br mike www net
<START> i like the good things in life as much as anybody i suppose but until about five years ago opera didn't figure into my entertainment choices oh i made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about i'd watched several television productions notably parts of wagner's ring cycle on public television hoping to understand other people's fascination with the art form and i knew i could like parts of various operas i remember being surprised as a kid that i actually liked the snippets of madame butterfly in my geisha and i enjoyed the opera scenes in moonstruck and pretty woman but unlike the characters in those films i just didn't get it br br then in 1995 i saw a live performance of rigoletto presented by the new york city opera company and that night i got it what a wonderful glorious pageant of color and music and raw emotion and i do mean emotion with a capital e the key i think is that the operatic music allows the performers to over act freely and believably in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken everything hinges on the music of course and when the music is magical as it is in rigoletto an opera can be a magnificent entertainment br br a sympathetic family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 tv production of the opera and i've found that since i can't see live performances of rigoletto live on a regular basis this video version is a fine substitute luciano pavarotti is perfect in the part of the duke is excellent as his mean spirited court jester rigoletto and beloved daughter gilda is played by the somewhat plain featured the sets and costumes are lavish and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a heightened sense of drama to the story that could never be matched on a stage br br if you've never seen rigoletto or if you think you don't like or understand opera i urge you to find this one on videotape and buy it or rent it if you don't like this if this production of rigoletto doesn't make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera well just give it up and move on to something else but i suspect if you're new to opera as i was that you'll be pleasantly surprised br br bill anderson
<START> without being really the worst science fiction film ever made or the worst i have seen 'time under fire' is still much under average the premises and the first 10 15 minutes are not that bad it starts as a x files story combining bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel pretty soon elements of other genres too many mix together but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series soon 'time under fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichÃ©s not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow acting is bad and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all
<START> this was my late wife's favorite film i'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as i'm sure she would have worn it out what can we say a great romantic story and the push off of two great men the and teddy rex sean connery and brian keith are great in these roles but while connery is his usual sexy sex it's the late brian keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial teddy roosevelt back up is provided with candy bergen gorgeous in her early 30s as the kidnapped american widow great back up also comes from the great john huston as beleaguered john hay geoffrey lewis from the clint eastwood films is great as the hesitant us ambassador the late with his demonically evil stare is great as the and more is given by steve kanaly and roy jensen whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds all in all this is a film filled with wonderful romance mindful of an era long gone mindless story not at all the issue of big nations pushing around smaller ones for their own interests is as true today as it was then overly romantic not really certainly not maudlin in any sense fun to watch you bet i own the video and will watch it again and again i suggest you do the same
