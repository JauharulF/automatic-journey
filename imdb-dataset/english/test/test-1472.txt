<START> from hardly alien sounding lasers to an elementary school style shuttle crash is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest the almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story the acting however is not nearly as beastly many of the young aspiring actors admirably showcase a hidden talent particularly don and jamie who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small maryland town
<START> reading the other two comments i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie br br perhaps life is drastically different in australia but wow call it sci fi or fantasy but people just don't act like this br br i couldn't pass up this review without commenting on it myself it gets better after the first half hour but i doubt most could make it that far br br yikes
<START> this movie gives you more of an how australians act even though the castle is a great australian movie it's a bit out there this movie is by far the best aussie flick i have seen haven't seen dirty deeds yet and probably would be my favourite movie the point is if you haven't seen it go see it if a crime action comedy is your thing
<START> i think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it if you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either if you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained it is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive the dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor as for the story well i'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth
<START> i was glad that this movie did without all the supposed depth of all too many pseudo serious interracial movies race was one issue yes but so was class and loyalty and honesty etc br br i also loved the idea that the love affair wasn't couched solely in the aspects of either character's appearance aren't our divorce courts on both sides of the atlantic i daresay filled now with enough couples who thought good together ' is all it takes to make a solid marriage in any case the tenderness and sensuality of both characters was thick enough to cut in love scenes that would have brought a rainbow to any dreary day in other words a light hearted movie that's by no means a light weight
<START> holden and jones sizzle in this movie but not in the way we think of sizzling today it's very subtle and under the surface yet palpable jennifer jones in particular is so sexually hot in this film much more than a caricature like monroe ever was because she creates a real woman with all facets of womanhood she's intelligent intuitive graceful she's desiring and desirable br br there's a scene on that famous hill where she's lying down in the grass looking up at holden and the expression in her eyes is x rated yet in the context of the scene and character in makes complete sense you don't need to have it all said in the dialogue spelled out like the crude obviousness in most modern films it's all there in her eyes sexy yet elegant what a stunning under rated actress she was i saw her madame bovary for the first time recently and was equally blown away i'll take her over bergman davis or the two any day
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br old detroit is back with the giant omni consumer corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new delta city continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of cain a cruel drug lord with delusions of christ likeness a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke as he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal with robocop out of action a ruthless business woman proposes plans for her new android a stomping snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it which cain fits perfectly after a brief glitch in his system robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with cain br br the original robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it no matter how many times you've seen it one of those films that just can't be done again that said it's not surprising a sequel was made it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original empire strikes back director irvin kirschner has crafted an unpleasant slightly incoherent and overlong film that can't capture the magic of the first film no matter how hard it tries and it certainly does that the funny ads from the first film running none stop the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before but with blood gore even meaner than the first film the first film earned a name for some nasty blood soaked violence including a man's genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces but while that was more memorable the violence gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature with a very unpleasant and mean spirited tone to it br br but overall the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead
<START> this film is about a teen who is struggling with his social status in school he is a good christian and feels that he is missing out on all the fun in high school so he wishes he had never become one after getting his wish and trying a worldly lifestyle he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically diminished and wants to go back to being the person that he was good family oriented film with a positive message of being proud of who you are even if you're not the most popular
<START> very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad this movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset there is no mention of jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture christianity as most know it br br i am also very surprised because this film is a bbc program and the bbc is quit well known for their quality programing but it looks like the bbc's attempt to rival the hollywood psycho drama films are failing completely br br poor acting poor plot poor culture that seems to be without religion i would not even bother buying this instead better to try to rent this one or buy it when it goes to the 2 dollar bin
<START> this second pairing of wile e coyote and the road runner is a great as the first predictable maybe but i don't care and still laugh so much whenever i see it the wile e road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart so knowing that the second disc of the golden collection would not only feature 11 of this but they would be in chronological order 2 through 12 the first episode was on volume 1 made me get misty eyed i love this stuff this animated short can be seen on disc 2 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 it also features an optional commentary by micheal barrier br br my grade a
<START> shameless waste of my time as a viewer this is one of the worst films i've seen in ages please do not rent it as you will regret doing so guaranteed i wonder how kathleen turner ended up in this she is a legitimate actress and people would perhaps be attracted to this film because of her but it really is better to act as if this title was never made it should not have come into existence
<START> this movie came highly recommended but i am not sure why i am not really and adam sandler fan though apart from in 50 first dates where he departs from his usual angry man routine damon wayans is an undercover cop and adam sandler is the guy he pretended to be friends with for a year in order to bust him naturally sandler is rather angry about this betrayal cue angry shouting and silly facials from the king of variety they end up on the run and of course they become friends again after a big misunderstanding involving sandler shooting wayans in the head he survives thus he is bulletproof need i go on you will work out what is going to happen if you do watch it anyway when our dvd player kept pausing hey it was 80 from the supermarket ok it was commented that the player knew the film was boring and was refusing to play it
<START> i enjoyed the movie and kellie martins performance immensely it's the kind of movie i can show my family and has an example of a young woman placed in extraordinary circumstances finding the courage to do the right thing in the face of extreme danger
<START> somehow i really thought that i was going to enjoy this film because i love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot i must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention i thought that nicole eggert diana pennington thank you good night '01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain marc singer angel blade '02 played a very unconvincing weird guy and over acted in many scenes with a bad temper that looked comical this film was a big disappointed and not worth watching unless there is nothing on the tv to enjoy
<START> don't get me wrong this was fun to watch it has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking bugs and some nice music and the standout scene was definitely elmer bugs and dance on the floor that was such a nice and fun touch as a matter of fact the whole cartoon is nice to watch but all in all it is not what i call exceptional like there are some very nice gags but they have been used before i feel and there wasn't much that i would deem hilarious and daffy joining forces with elmer somehow seeing as he was a target of the hunter didn't it seem odd that he would be friends with him though i will admit it was nice having daffy there the voice acting was above average too but somehow i missed mel blanc br br all in all unexceptional but very nice cartoon 7 10 bethany cox
