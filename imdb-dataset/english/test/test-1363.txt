<START> so as far as i gather this episode is trying to make a statement about how real life villains are very bad people and this is just as scary as the paranormal the paranormal imagery associated with the villain donnie is purely symbolic he's actually just a normal human being br br the problem is that i just don't buy it donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal he's not even that scary at all as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious likes dead girls and hair and has only newly become a murderer he's significantly less disturbing than most well known real life serial killers eg he's like a very watered down version of ed gein which is why horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all is completely out of character she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches br br so as comic book guy says worst episode ever
<START> i am a huge fan of the first four ju on projects i own them and watch them every few months i lend them to co workers and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality japanese film making i think takashi shimizu created a great story and presented it very effectively in these four installments br br i was somewhat excited about the grudge 2 opening in theaters i saw the first american grudge before watching the four originals the grudge was actually pretty good of course the originals are better but i got a good halloween scare from the 2004 american grudge br br the grudge 2 started off badly and went down from there i kept waiting for it to get better to make sense to show shimizu's talent nothing like this happened the thing that's great about shimizu's ju on work is the story true it's usually told in a disjointed style that you have to think about to connect its components but it is still a great story there was no story in the grudge 2 it was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care about br br the editing was atrocious disjointed as in the japanese originals is one thing but the complete randomness of scene sequence was exhausting i just kept thinking this is so stupid and no he didn't really sell out this much did he it made me want to walk out of the theater run home and watch the original work simply to reassure myself that shimizu has not always made this dumbed down generic boring non sensical thrown together tripe br br if you really have your heart set on seeing this movie i suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it really two of the five people in the theater with me walked out about 45 minutes into it i debated on whether to do that myself going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that point br br i am truly shocked at how bad this movie was let's pray sam raimi doesn't put out more cash to make the grudge 3 it's just not worth it anymore sigh
<START> this is a very dark movie somewhat better than the average asylum film it was a lot better than i thought it would be is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film br br the voice on the telephone is really creepy this voice without a face this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator br br the action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film it becomes vertiginous there is not much gore in this film just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention br br i gave this movie a 8 10 because some clichÃ©s
<START> just plain terrible nick and michael are way better actors than this a c rated flick at best the plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped even the film and sound quality was terrible i suppose that these were all young actors at the time and this script just filled a job
<START> i rented this film because i enjoy watching things with lauren graham in them well she was the highlight everyone else seemed complete separated from the picture you kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going what however she provided some clarity as she was the only normal character in the picture which actually isn't saying much for the film personally it was too far fetched for me however i am glad i rented despite the fact i would never want to own it i still feel that lauren graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character she seemed to steal the movie my husband and i were happier and cared more about her character ending up with josh's character than we were about the two main characters
<START> corridors of blood br br aspect ratio 1 66 1 br br sound format mono br br black and white br br london 1840 whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution a dedicated surgeon boris karloff becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers br br riding the coat tails of a gothic revival by the recent success of hammer's the curse of frankenstein 1957 robert day's corridors of blood is an odd mixture of historical drama and grand guignol theatrics producer richard gordon lured karloff away from hollywood where his movie career had become stalled in a b movie rut voodoo island frankenstein 1970 etc for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control in grip of the strangler 1958 he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history while in corridors of blood he's a drug addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by east end pub landlord francis de wolff less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills a leg sliced open a face destroyed by acid etc but the narrative is motivated chiefly by karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery br br produced under the title 'the doctor from seven the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors mgm by which time co star christopher lee had earned a prominent screen credit despite playing a small but significant role as a sinister cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors lee filmed this glorified cameo before the curse of frankenstein catapulted him to international stardom which accounts for his limited screen time though his intense performance is one of the film's highlights adrienne corri vampire circus distinguishes herself as de wolff's partner in crime and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles including francis matthews dracula prince of darkness betta st john the city of the dead finlay currie and nigel green superb art direction by anthony masters and cinematography geoffrey faithful
<START> when i was in 7th grade back in 1977 i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year later br br kristy was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie well br br esther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaks as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parent's affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the title br br the best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations br br the film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd br br
<START> there is so much wrong with this movie greico with a girls wig old man scientist time machine fixer tough guy jones who stays behind with a shotgun that has three rounds spider people with tentacle hands and bad teeth etc the make up was so bad and they only had a few visible spider people on screen at one time aliens cameron technique could have been used instead they chose to dress every spider person the same way badly the nice thing about greico's acting is that he bobs his had at every syllable as if he is counting how many words he gets to speak in the script it amazes me that with all of the information out there on dvd commentaries people like this still exist who make movies this movie could have been worse how i don't know oh and one last thing i am going on a sci fi movie hunt down the people running that channel should not be allowed to procreate to further continue the nepotism that exist in film and television
<START> i was a hippie age 22 in 1965 have seen the play 5 times have 2 versions of the music and have read the script many times maybe taken as an separate thing the movie is ok but as an adoption of the play it's terrible br br first the good the songs are sung well and the production values are pretty good the homosexual implications in black boys white boys is cute the claude berger switch was interesting hair is a fluid production and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained br br but the basic spirit was very much distorted it seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs and fit the story line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play br br claude sheila and hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe claude destroyed sheila's parents party it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt and repeatedly stole cars sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly probably be busted in rank and could likely die on that lonely nevada road good fun and hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex this is not what hippies were like not what the play described and is directly opposite to a love generation br br i've never seen a hippie beg for money the point was to be self sufficient outside the capitalist system not beg from it br br after berger is thrown in jail for ruining sheila's party and claude offers to bail some out berger insists on being bailed instead with no better plan for the rest that hitting on sheila's parents and then hitting on his own mommy br br be in has always been a very spiritual point but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around even if this is part of his trip it ruins a beautiful song i know they're contrasting floating in space with the army but again it totally ruins a beautiful song br br while sheila and claude are skinny dipping berger steals their clothes laughing it was fun man even after he could see both were very annoyed then a little later berger does one thing that no hippie ever does he hits claude terrible br br then they have the perfect opportunity to sing at night in some beautiful sf spot with the stars twinkling down maybe working into an inventive duet instead the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible stolen of course br br i was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979 and i like it even less now i think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show but this ain't it
<START> this review contains a partial spoiler br br shallow from the outset 'd o a ' at least starts as if it might be a slick entertaining piece of nonsense like fincher's 'the game' it's central character dennis quaid suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller but the plot rattles along at too great a pace leading to a dramatic twist not half way through when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1 2 days to live and this simply is too big a twist to add casually to a story once this has happened the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal indeed its only subject matter but 'd o a ' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller the problem is two fold firstly quaid's actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do and secondly even if they did convince it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved the rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort but made more tedious than usual by the character's slightly treated predicament which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in dennis quaid in the lead role doesn't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die meg ryan is as often ditzy and annoying another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack watch 'the game' instead which from similar roots remains tight and character driven whereas 'd o a ' drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise as the premise is itself quite intriguing it's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over cooked plot
<START> i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i'm not particularly interested in the dialogue is and philosophical making sense no doubt only to it's franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile
<START> this is such a great movie to watch and all the actors put together a great film which would be enjoyed by everyone it is very emotional in parts so when you watch it grab a box of tissues to keep you company this movie doesn't deserve a rating below 10 10
<START> so this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment after the paperwork is done the psychiatrist says i'm going to show you ink blots tell me what you see in them well says the patient looking at the first one i see a man and a woman having sex on seeing the second one he says i see two women having sex on seeing the third he says i see two men having sex on seeing the next one he says i see two men and two women having sex the psychiatrist puts down the the so he says we'll start by discussing your my says the guy and you with all these dirty pictures that's how this movie strikes me
<START> hunt for justice is a canadian television drama that has made it to dvd and that is reason for gratitude for those who hunger for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media the film is not a hollywood production it relies heavily on footage from court files but it also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of louise in bringing about the trial of yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic br br louise veteran canadian actor wendy crewson is a canadian judge appointed by nato as the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal in the hague the film begins in 1996 when travels to the hague to face the political obstacles that are preventing the tribunal to bringing to justice the war criminals in the war yugoslavia has been waging in serbia croatia and bosnia a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide extermination camps and other heinous abuses the progress toward bringing the criminals to justice is hampered by generals including one played by william hurt who fear a major world war if precautions against same are upon with the keen help of her translator her staff including keller heino ferch and the unexpected assistance from british capt john tanner john corbett forges ahead focusing the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end this leaves only slobodan milosevic himself and and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999 br br there are several touching side plots employed in the telling of this well documented tale stories that make the point in history more personal some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film wendy crewson carries the power to drive the message home the message that war crimes must never go unpunished there is much current history to be learned from this film writers ian adams riley adams and m a have condensed the information and made it dramatic as well director charles balances the docudrama with the story progress never forgetting that he has a tale of intrigue to tell as well hunt for justice is worth watching grady harp
<START> this movie is so bad but its so bad that i was laughing my ass off for people that like movies do not watch this one for people who like movies good and bad i recommend this one the story lines shaky the script is horrible the acting is horrible to mediocre the soundtrack throughout the movie was corny but i loved it the cool catchphrases were a plus tho ha ha if it can bleed it can die the fight scenes cracked me up it seemed to me like they spent more time on those parts than any other cuz the fight scenes for the most part were pretty clean i almost feel like this movie could have been good if it weren't for the f x no it would have still been a the eye thing was corny and how the chick was eating the guys stomach in the kitchen they coulda done something where shed be actually eating something or at least put more of the fake blood on her face and the lighthouse explosion disappointed me i thought they might have gotten real fire instead of crappy computer synthesized stuff and the ending was so predictable which surprised me when they actually did what i though they might do so overall id say this is a classic as far as crappy movies go its in my bottom 5
