<START> yes you can look at babette's feast as some sort of slap at puritanical christianity but it is much more than that the surface story of how a gifted parisian cook flees paris after one of its revolutions by the middle classes and finds herself cast ashore in jutland in the north of denmark is simply the grease that allows the deeper tale to develop br br babette is an artist one of the small army of people who are driven from pillar to post over the centuries by fatuous politicians vane greedy and arrogant who kill beauty for profit something that politics always does pace national endowment for the arts which simply creativity for propaganda purposes br br babette is on her last legs as she arrives in the tiny village where two virginal sisters reside seeing over their diminishing flock of devotees to their late pastor father they live on salt cod and black bread gruel br br babette shows these simple pious people that god is in pleasure and sensuality as well as behavioral and mental purity she also shows them how that mental purity can lead to control something we all know about in these days of the neo in government who would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state or as they would tell us humanity br br babette cooks up a bang up french dinner to celebrate the 100th birthday of the late reverend the daughters and their flock think it is the devil come amongst them and vow not to notice the food or drink br br it is at this point in the preparing of the meal payed for by babette's winnings in a french lottery that i begin to tear up it is a poignance brought about in comparison to the daily vulgarity and that floods our consciousness from morning to night via the media and power mongers to gain advantage over all of us out here in the dark br br the simple sophistication of babette's art spits in the face of all the pretentiousness on display in our modern society and it hurts to watch it played out so exquisitely in this splendid film br br it is along with fanny alexander bergman my favorite film ever yet i can only watch it once in awhile because like a rare bottle of wine served with and fresh oysters it is something that must not be over done br br a great great film that should be in every movie lover's library

<START> don't torture a duckling lucio fulci italy 1972 br br definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that's quite an achievement in giallo land originally the film was titled even more absurdly don't torture donald duck literally translated from its italian title a small donald duck figure features briefly as a toy but hardly enough to render a title like this but apparently it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by disney i quite a bit against fulci's earlier lizard in a woman's skin 1971 but here all the right ingredients are present a surprisingly effective mystery a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting everything just clicks i think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements br br the story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain side town in sicily where someone is killing young teenage boys among the suspects the most obvious one is a young woman florinda balkan a self proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies guiseppe the village idiot is under suspicion as well since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap by the time a quick witted tomas arrives from milan to cover the murders he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects don alberto the local priest marc porel with a high minded attitude and patrizia barbara bouchet a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town talk about your prime red herring br br fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the sicilian hills past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition one could debate about the film's political stance as the north versus the south or as commentary on small town virtues society's conventions in general that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration chaos and ultimately self justice by the populace the film has often been lambasted because of its anti catholic tone but it's hardly an important element here except for obvious plot related reasons which would be giving away too much it's actually rather tame compared to a film like don't deliver us from evil 1971 probably the film's rather unflattering portrayal of small town sicilian values when another boy is killed the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynch mob might be cause for some offense in sicily but considering problematic relation with the rest of italy hardly problematic for other italians i would think the film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway br br when talking fulci the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion although eyes gouging scenes are lacking the film does contain two very graphic scenes in the gross out finale the killer falls of a cliff smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results albeit not very realistic and the chain whipping sequence with florinda balkan in the graveyard shows fulci's penchant for sadistic violence and typically he's not holding back at graphically showing what most film makers would merely hint at surely one of the most horrifying scenes in fulci's repertoire br br above all this is a taut well written effective little mystery nicely lensed by fulci with an impressive cast of genre regulars like barbara bouchet marc porel not very convincing as a priest tomas and florinda balkan mouth crazy as the town's witch br br camera obscura 8 10
<START> 1 must be as the reviewer in the new york times who preferred the janis joplin big brother and the holding company album to the just released beatles' white album was called either evil or insane national velvet is a great film elizabeth taylor's performance is fantastic and i fail to discern even a trace of accent much less too much of one her performance is very natural authentic and unbelievably charming the rest of the cast is superb especially rooney and revere br br as far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental i suggest cc has too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straight forward emotion and human interaction there was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner not that this film doesn't have a slight hint of the magical permeating through it that is the reason to tell the story one might as well criticize the wizard of oz king kong the maltese falcon casablanca the black stallion the other great horse film or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life no my friend national velvet endures because of its belief firmly in itself with tongue firmly not in cheek something today's jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate
<START> a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks my friend grabbed head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie well you guessed it it was me i have never been so in all my life we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about 45mins because this was the funniest film in the world i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments this movie it makes me laugh even more head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
<START> i will leave it to my uhh betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful movie and just say that i thought it stunk the great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views and seek them out by all means no telling what you will come out of the film with for me the ones who saw through the and shenanigans of it have my money there was one dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing which belong to pacino the meeting and the airport other than that well what a waste of time utterly pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five notches at about the level of his protÃ©gÃ© everybody always says but this movie could have been so much better sure they all could have been but really most of them just should never have been made including this one
<START> based on what little i have seen of this show i don't think i will ever watch it again its not even remotely believable and frankly the derek character just makes me angry br br sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again why would i want to watch that no thanks there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters phil of the future's for example where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though br br not to mention that i think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step siblings yes life isn't rosy but one could attempt to portray a character that wasn't outright evil and wins br br my suggestion is that you watch this only if you like seeing the villain win
<START> a flesh eating octopus where does that guy boaz what the davidson keep getting inspiration anyway even for the low low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people genre and me this one is just beyond awful the octopus is one of the lamest laziest weakest monsters i've ever seen i think he just ended up in the east river because sea world got sick of him the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them bunch of idiots that way he'll never learn you guys want all the other giant killer octopuses that's the correct plural by the way to laugh at him meanies br br up to stop the octopus are wind razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick and his partner who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus hooray octopus won the fight a couple more and he's going to evolve the scars in my mind stay nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing doesn't he have a gun or something but no that magically doesn't help either br br okay enter sea cop's love interest rachel is this based on some comic book or something anyway together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park they hope this helps cos it's the 4th of july in a couple of days and the octopus might join the party and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops br br but all's crappy that ends crappy nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh you know on tummy vision this would probably get an r in real life i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is suitable for absolutely nobody there's no sex no gore no nothing now forget this movie ever existed join the club
<START> i found the movie to be very light and enjoyable one knows that the story is not real life like yet the depiction is superb br br lyrics are really good and john travolta in his usual style i like the scene wherein he as an angel gives up his own stuff to bring life back to the dog
<START> i'm torn about this show while most parts of it i found to be hilarious other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children however i don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things it's not that i think oh poor children they're being exploited it's just that it's really not clever it's something that anyone could do therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time br br by far the funniest part of wonder is clarence the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers it's really funny and it's mostly improvised seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man was by far the funniest scene in my opinion br br you should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny even if it is stupid at times
<START> i haven't seen a lot of episodes of family guy and it's a pretty safe bet that i won't be seeing too many in the future some people say to compare this show to the simpsons is unfair i absolutely think this show wouldn't exist if the simpsons hadn't come first and i absolutely think it wants so very much to be the simpsons i don't understand what's so funny about this show in the episodes that i've watched i've understood where they've wanted me to laugh i understand that someone thinks a joke was just told but the joke isn't funny i find the whole show to be lazy the title the jokes there is a complete lack of inspiration throughout br br the best shows on television cartoon or not are created like this a script is written it goes through several rewrites stuff that doesn't work is taken out inspiration is sparked good stuff is added there are more rewrites and then it is filmed br br i picture a family guy episode to be created like this a script is written and it's filmed
<START> a film by almodovar sends a tingle down my spine every time the capitalized print which opens the spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns gentle wisecracking i haven't even got as far as the infant terrible's critically reviled early work and after a beautiful opening montage with the camera roving across a wind swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones i thought pedro had me again under his wicked spell br br yet once my nostalgia had subsided there was very little to fill its place for a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women penelope cruz is a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental killing of her abusive husband thankfully she lives in almodovar's spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails add to the melting pot the ghost of mother and a host of other eccentrically warm hearted matriarchs means literally to return and pedro does appear to be recycling old material the sub plot of incest feels as though it were tacked on as the obligatory taboo instead of commenting on or subverting the issue as with his treatment of paedophilia in bad education it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film's chick flick sentimentality i suggest almodovar call his next film to move on
<START> anna christie greta garbo returns to see her father chris george f marion after 15 years he is the skipper of a boat and she stays to travel with him during this time she meets matt charles bickford and they fall in love matt and chris don't see eye to eye and anna has a secret to confess br br what a boring story it starts badly with george f marion and marie dressler playing drunks in a bar the scene goes on forever and they are both terrible its also hard to understand them in fact its difficult to understand the whole cast i missed whole sections of dialogue between bickford marion and garbo because it is incomprehensible garbo is obviously something special as you are drawn to her every time that she is on screen and her presence gives this film the 4 stars that i have given to it but nothing really happens its a boring story with atrocious accents you'll do well to stay awake
<START> i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight valentino with elizabeth perkins gwyneth whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner there are a lot of similarities between the two films they both have great casts and good acting they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different an offensive stepmother a woman friend confidant an emotionally unavailable father a dead mother and a surprise lover both films have the characters experience life changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of 'love conquers all' sentimentality they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow naked br br both films seem contrived as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said ok there's a market for stories about relationships between women so i'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive in other words instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation it seems forced the characters don't seem real the relationships are unbelievable br br the resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after it's just not real romantic fantasy br br the characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than moonlight valentino especially the stepmother part is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her in the first place br br if you liked moonlight valentino you will probably like in her shoes as well enjoyable performances in both in fact the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts
<START> i'm going to make this short and sweet it's not surprising that you had no use for this film this is a story about the power beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected or worse completely wasted your comments are those of a truly ignorant person i would advise you to do something about this condition but in your case i feel it's probably too late my hope is that you yourself don't intend to go into the teaching profession especially in film studies because you could only do damage oh one last bit of advice in the future if you intend to write more opinion pieces you should really proofread your work it will make people take you more seriously
