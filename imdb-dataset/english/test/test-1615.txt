<START> ok to start with this movie was not at all like the book i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite when i'm waiting for a different book to come out this is the book i turn to to fill in the time i have 3 copies for god's sake anyways i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on they could have done a little better than this i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly i'm tired of watching it i mean hello the best part of the whole f g sorry story is she ends up with gabriel he doesn't die what was that about and he's old in this movie gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da it awww and astrid who the he came up with the idea of astrid being aunt no no no no astrid and vivian hate each other awwww anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pi ed off hope this helped
<START> i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival 2002 this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting br br the story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on actual facts moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play not only do they all happen to be good actors jia parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective br br jia is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso br br i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him br br the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him because there are personal with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well br br the film has a heavy feel but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation
<START> sam ninja 3 the domination mixes martial arts with the exorcist like horror the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable but the film works as a mindless action martial arts flick the fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting and the film is never boring so forget stupid dialogue lame acting and annoying soundtrack grab some beer and check this one out highly recommended
<START> this movie is just great it starts out real slow and boring but as the movie progresses well the fun keeps on coming the power of the movie is perhaps in it's subtle references to a lot and i mean a lot of other movies for me the best part was perhaps the bruce lee crouching tiger hidden dragon scene how the two actors switches from french to chinese or whatever asian language it was it was awesome then the jokes with the names they are hilarious but perhaps you won't understand all of them when your an american no offense overall a great movie
<START> pyaar na ho is a great family movie salman khan is looking handsome and great than ever there's even a scene where he takes off his shirt what a surprise rani mukherjee is great too pooja had very few lines to say but i'm glad she has been acknowledged for her role because she definitely has potential br br it's about prem salman khan and he is a wedding singer he is about to marry nisha raveena tandon but gets stood up prem goes to house and asks her why he was ditched and it's because her brother is ill and she needs to marry an nri rahul inder kumar to get the money to get him treated prem moves on and in comes priya rani mukherjee prem falls in br br love with priya but it's a shame she's about to get married to an nri who could this nri be priya falls in love with prem too while rahul is there with her prem gives priya an insulting comment one day and she goes off and sets off to for the wedding with rahul will prem stop her watch to find out br br the film was very funny the songs were great especially the song o priya o priya it's a shame the film flopped in india and i don't know why every film in india is going flop nowadays this film deserved to be a hit the only problem i found with the film is that they had an obsession about they think all are rich the film deserves a 9 10
<START> thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption i ever made br br drivvle does not describe this movie appropriately enough br br not only is the plot thin but i get more emotional acting from my pet fish br br it was a shame to see pete postlethwaite whom i respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with br br i think that a cardboard cut out of stephen baldwin would have done a better job and in fact have been more animate br br avoid at all costs this could really be hazardous to your health
<START> mickey rourke hunts diane lane in elmore leonard's killshot it is not like mickey rourke ever really disappeared he has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene he was memorable in domino sin city man on fire once upon a time in mexico and get carter but in his powerful dramatic performance in the wrestler 2008 we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in get carter whenever we get to know him rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball br br this is an elmore leonard story and production leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3 10 to yuma be cool jackie brown get shorty 52 pick up and joe kidd this means that we get tough guys some good some not so good br br it also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions killshot is no different tough slim ball killer rourke stalks unhappily married witness lane think history of violence meets no country for old men it is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good if you like those two including david equally wonderful eastern promises you will like killshot also br br director john madden has not done a lot of movies his last few were enjoyable if not successful proof captain mandolin and shakespeare in love br br diana lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and richard gere gave incredible performances in unfaithful lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as nights in must love dogs and under the tuscan sun here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension br br this is a small part for rosario dawson yet dawson does a good job with it you see a lot more of lane including an underwear scene to rival sigourney weaver in aliens and nicole kidman in eyes wide shut br br while you are in the crime drama section also pick up kiss kiss bang bang and gone baby gone and before the devil knows your dead the last has wonderful performances by phillip seymour hoffman ethan hawke marisa tomei and albert finney br br killshot flopped at the box office more is our luck it is certainly worth a 3 4 dollar rental if you like this genre 6 20 2009
<START> i had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it i trust this friend's taste so i purchased the dvd my wife and i sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about i thought it was the funniest film i have seen in a long time mainly because i saw the truth in the satire i strongly recommend this film to all my friends br br this is not a film for everyone some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity and find idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen what these people don't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there not to amuse the audience but to show what appeals to the morons in the future br br luke wilson is well cast as an average joe he is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film many of the funnier bits are in the background so it is easily worth seeing several times what makes the movie even funnier and more scary is that i see elements of it in every day life in people i meet or on the media then i go back and re watch idiocracy and realize how good it is br br the few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club i'll see an advertisement for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient and turn to my wife and say it's got electrolytes she knows exactly what i am saying
<START> i really don't have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night the acting was actually amazing i didn't expect it to be better than it appeared i thought keanu's who looks the same since 1986 which is a very good thing hehe acting was really great and crispin played his character perfectly this movie is a hidden gem its a fresh awaking of reality to the '80s compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack even though i do like those alot too all in all i give it thumbs up
<START> the first official release of world wrestling entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror slasher movie called see no evil starring kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hard hitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling and let's not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by wwe it goes without saying that after having seen this movie i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time br br see no evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up of course a monstrous murderer played by kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early 1980s slasher flick with most of the clichÃ©s intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany and that's sort of the main problem with see no evil it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next it's too generic to be scary br br the movie's gory no doubt but it's only there for the effect the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly the death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventive br br and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed some can't even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote so when they die it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet to the monster kane br br as for kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone there's no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre he has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work with br br now despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film it's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy my main gripe with the film again is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didn't it got laughs because it's a b movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendously br br if you don't mind a fun b movie or funny horror film i'd highly recommend see no evil if you are a true enthusiast of the genre i'd wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else
<START> i have yet to watch the first entry in this series however fortunately i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected twists and turns and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts herein in case there is any confusion let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything i've just said is coated in pure carefully nurtured sarcasm the kind that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this flick a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator whose only other credit in that field is a henry rooker film that wasn't well received the acting is average at best and i defy anyone to not find scottish computer woman come on seriously what is with that last name 's russian accent laughable and or irritating there is an attempt or two at stylization in this and they are reasonable the action isn't terrible cinematography and editing are fine the music is cool enough language is infrequent if even that violence is fairly bloody i recommend this solely to fans of b movies and i will say that you can do worse than this 1 10
<START> philippe garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the nouvelle vague almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor but ready to rise again from its ashes if recalled from the past they who are a little acquainted with the director's subjects on the other hand may know very well how he's obsessed by a lingering sense of loss as far as fickleness of reality is concerned les amants therefore show us the parallel stories of an amour fou and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young french students br br the first part of the story is about the dramatic events of may '68 in france evoked in a series of astonishing plan sequences a sort of cinema veritÃ© style that place the student insurrection in anything but an enviable light against a pitch black background br br there's much that can be said about the peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and police where the high contrasts confer an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and darkness closes in upon the excited bodies wrapping them in mystery the images completely deprived of words show the real consistence of the myth made of crude violence more and more emphasized by the exasperated reality of the movie shootings the individual doesn't count anything at all here he tends to disappear in the mass what really matters in these fight scenes are the significance of the mass suggestion the blind fury of the juvenile assault sinister eulogies of the power of the mob even if conceived like separate entities apart from any kind of emotion with the cold and distant look of an entomologist intent to catalog his insect collection br br the second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way stands out on the horizon the distressing portrait of a self centered generation in search of its lost time completely disenchanted about the individual values of men inclined to rotate on its own axis between opium fumes and making a funeral oration in the praise of its recent defeat br br les amants seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great robert bresson revised and corrected by particular sensibility without drifting away from the main argument trying to expand overall perspectives on the subject of human that though painful may bring us to the truth in my opinion trying to penetrate deeply into the of the story if a man lets himself go and play things by ear he probably will find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with dire and irretrievable consequences
<START> i thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before but i can't find it on here anyway i am writing it again i accidentally found this movie from my college's library collections it was free to watch so why not br br i am certainly glad that i watched it i love this movie i have seen a few russian movies before most of them have serious topics i am surprised that this was one a good comedy i had a great laugh while watching it and this is a movie that i want to buy this thing is so funny and they are not just silly funny those plots were very original and well thought so they don't seem to be silly at all i am surprised that this movie didn't attract many viewers this is a classic that you can watch it over and over br br those actors were also very authentic their acting are real not faked if you haven't watched it go get a copy soon definitely recommended
<START> what an utter disappointment forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane all the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons peter cook is good as the british pm it lacks the biting satire of the original going instead for lowest common denominator slapstick 1 out of 10 if i'm being generous this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people
<START> what a disappointment i've enjoyed the jon cleary books about malone but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone in the books he's a city detective who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in fisticuffs for the film the character has been spiced up into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him i don't know taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy br br but his character's stamina is remarkable he flies in from australia apparently goes straight to the house rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black tie reception saves him from assassination getting into a fight in the process goes to a casino with one girl leaves with another and takes her to bed so much for jet lag on the way back to the house showing a good knowledge of london back streets he gets beaten up by the baddies but is still first down to breakfast it's also remarkable that the limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise of a clock activated bomb br br the best thing is joseph the butler's disdain for the uncouth malone and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue though some scenes take place during the tennis week
