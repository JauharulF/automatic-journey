<START> if this is not my favorite movie of all time it definitely is in the top five i love this everything about this is perfect the clothes the set the lines yes they're not how normal people talk but right down to the small scenes especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes picking a wedgie watering the office ivy plant putting lunch in the fridge identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005 i think all the minor characters are wonderful if someone like joan crawford is over the top it's all part of the package if you pick out many things in the movie it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not take it lying down at least not if they didn't want to as far as characters being contradictory for instance suzy parker's character acting like she's all for flings but then getting too attached to louis character isn't that what many people are like contradictory they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane baker's character finding the love of her life after her illegitimate baby in an accident lying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head this is part of the package too it's charm glossy escapism i like the mix of real stories pertinent today the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men therefore doesn't have a family when she is older with ones that make you wish ah if only i could fall in love with a doctor and he'll love me even though he knows my sordid past and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident also i just got the dvd widescreen it's yet even more beautiful than full screen yay
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen but extremely funny not on purpose though every scene that contains anything to do with aircraft romance script or acting is badly messed up br br i recommend this film for all pilots itÂ´s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film also see airport 79 the concorde for the same reason br br anyone else avoid this film like the plague except for fans of b movies of course br br enjoy
<START> the plot is predictable it has been done many times in other movies you have competing summer camps in this one the rich kids vs the underachievers competing for bragging rights in the typical camp contests while the kids and pursue pranks sex and a good time are you ready for the summer meatballs is the first and best summer camp movie for feel good comedy as others have posted it's no citizen kane but this type of movie isn't meant to be the film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one liners of bill murray his scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kid's self esteem are very good bill's one liners throughout the film are very funny br br i also like that this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other teens at camp movies today there is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film but meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd it's rated pg br br this is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes when bill murray is on the screen or making one of his classic pa announcements you are drawn to the film bill seems to carry the movie all by himself but he does it so well that when you see meatballs you will realize that this is the film that made him a star a side note to this review is to avoid all of the meatball movie sequels they are horribly bad
<START> it's taken years for cult icon bruce campbell to get this project off the ground but he finally has it's here and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is looking at the plot it sounds like two things a great base for a very silly b movie and a shameless excuse for bruce campbell to what he does best evil dead ii style slapstick humour and this film delivers on both counts the man with the screaming brain is comic book nonsense all the way through but there's some really great scenes and it's almost impossible to be bored with this movie bruce campbell wrote directs produces and stars in this film and while it's not quite citizen kane it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a woodland cabin the plot follows american businessman william cole on a business trip to bulgaria with his girlfriend the trip goes awry however when he his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead thanks to the same woman mad scientist stacy keach is on hand to merge cole and the taxi driver's brains into one and we've got a cult flick on our hands br br the first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs but once the main plot point has been executed the movie really picks up bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations from changing his clothes in a waste bin to deciding with the taxi driver in his brain what to eat in a restaurant the humour is mostly of the slapstick variety and anyone who enjoyed evil dead ii which should be anyone who's seen it will no doubt enjoy this too it does feel like campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project but if you tuned in and didn't see bruce doing what he does best disappointment would ensue besides that no disrespect to the man but he's never been the actor with the greatest range despite being lots of fun the movie isn't great as it gets a little bit too silly at times and there's a whole sub plot with a robot that i didn't like but overall the man with the screaming brain is a film that we sadly don't see too much of nowadays the film is an all out no holds barred b movie and it deserves respect for that if nothing else
<START> i wasn't expecting much from this film but was eager to try something which i initially thought would primarily be an early 80s teen horror although three teens are somewhat critical plot it is by no means a teen horror film br br 'the power' is about a little aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor who must be adult and thus becomes the vessel for unleashing all of the idol's evil and often with deadly implications for not only the victims of the possessor but of the possessor himself after making several exchanges in vying over control of this thing three teenagers wind up finding it and can't figure out what it is except that since they found it strange and dangerous things are afoot they offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy into the spiritual bologna although it is her producer who wants to investigate further especially if it means he can get control of the idol i presume the teens are even not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol it is a story told a thousand times particularly in 1950s and 60s horror and science fiction fare br br this one was at least for me able to sustain some interest though low budget it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with bad acting as many of the low budget come and go horror fare of the earlier decades had nowadays they have the same cheesy qualities but bigger budgets we are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth despite a story of clichÃ©s and though not terribly gory the special effects were done nicely br br again it is routine horror tale especially with the ending which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly overused but one that is not so embarrassingly bad it might be worth checking out even if just for laughs
<START> living in romania i was almost stunned by the very realistic setting for the scenes and the great care paid to local details by the director the performance of anthony queen is absolutely great and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting him the movie does take a little knowledge of the east european context in order to be fully enjoyed but it remains otherwise a great performance with some memorable lines the ending is maybe a bit too melodramatic but that's actually the way people are in this part of the world i believe the screenplay is great because it presents the horrors of the 2nd ww in a most original manner no blood no battlefields still lives are shattered and the smiles you get every now and then throughout the movie are quickly killed by the war realities touching the characters
<START> i'm a big fan of patricia hodge and margolyes so i watched this show when it came on a e some years ago the show was strange to say the least but i gave it a chance because i liked these actresses this has got to be one of the worst shows i've ever seen i wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video the storyline of this tv version is ludicrous and just plain stupid the kicker pun intended comes when ruth has surgery done on her leg bones that kind of nonsense belongs in james bond and sci fi movies if this version is true to the book then i won't be checking the book out from my local library the american version came out some years after i'd seen this original to my surprise the americans got it right this time as their version with meryl streep and roseanne is played for laughs and is rather funny when played for laughs the storyline works
<START> i watched this movie the night it premiered on mtv usually to me mtv movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good summer phoenix is an amazing actress and i thought that nick stahl was good too if mtv started showing more movies like this i would probably enjoy the channel a lot more
<START> this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie gee maybe that's why it is a straight to video wanna be movie br br i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it one of the worst decisions i have ever made what a waste i usually like b movies some of them are actually quite good but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny br br the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film these so called movie makers have absolutely no talent br br stupid plot horrible acting especially the drag queens what sicko would actually find that sexy lame writing if there even was a script seems like the kinda bull someone just made up on the spot br br what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well done at all br br how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results br br anyway avoid this stink bomb at all costs
<START> one true thing is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances i am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting because it isn't in fact the movie is down right depressing i am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd br br i cried in one true thing enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998 the characters were perfectly casted the performances are all guaranteed oscar nominees especially meryl streep who portraits the dying kate extremely well her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation and gives you a new point of view at her i also thought that renÃ©e zellweger portrayed a realistic single free wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother the other cast members including william hurt tom everett scott were also superb the script of this movie was really fantastic it is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area you see i live near lansing michigan and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor jack excuse my miss spelling if so ways have just been outlawed the public will vote on this according to their beliefs in november after watching one true thing it really changed my perspective at this topic although i have always believed in it without revealing the ending of the film i will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and i think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story overall this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than titanic saving private ryan or any other tearjerker released in the last few years i think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day so it relates better to an audience and indeed that this could happening to you
<START> i really appreciate what jung won had done before his death everything i want to say that his choice for love is unselfish if he chose da rim that will be good for him but da rim will need more time to recover from his death obviously he does not want to let it happen as he did in the film he chose giving up so it was just temporary agony for da rim br br as comparison my life without me is very different their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture i cannot say which is better every one can has right to choose that is totally up to you life is equal for everybody we can live only once any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for you br br in truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie just calm down you will get more from the movie br br one of the best korean movies i ever watched 9 10
<START> this swedish splatter movie tries to parody imitate american horror films such as the evil dead gremlins and others writer director actor cinematographer anders and writer producer actor makeup effects supervisor did i miss something were obviously inspired by sam raimi but the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in the evil dead and elsewhere some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this film but i didn't br br the film rather disturbed than entertained me it tries to combine suspense and comedy and the final product just left me with a feeling of oppressiveness although it wasn't scary or shocking at all the combination of different genre elements made this film very strange i was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny br br the story is quite inventive except for the showdown at the hospital but i didn't like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above the gore make up effects are considerably good and at least the loose limbs sequences were quite entertaining because in these scenes the film makers didn't try to mix scares and jokes br br all in all a strange film that you will either hate or love rest in pieces evil ed br br my rating 3 10 made me stick to american productions
<START> this film played in lexington ky for 7 days i saw it on the last day of its run regretted that i could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience the aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deck almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days i just cringe to think that more people won't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater the dvd experience will not be the same here's an idea if you live in a college town see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival
<START> and unfortunately so did i any movie that relies on a bad pun as its tagline or its title should be relegated to the 2 00 bin but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie for movie night we had a winner in house of the dead go with that one if you want a laughable flick br br some witch jumped into the water after being set on fire by mr miner some guy took a dump in the woods and that same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one i don't remember much else the last third of the movie was utterly insipid and we were all waiting in agony until the end
<START> there have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope but the war at home is worth seeing portraying vietnam vet jeremy collier emilio estevez having trouble connecting with his texas family much of the movie is very likely to tense you up but nothing can prepare you for what ends up getting revealed br br part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both texas and of the generation gap jeremy's parents bob martin sheen and kathy bates clearly have a problem with their son's attitude both about the war and his rejection of americanism his sister karen kimberly williams is uncertain with whom to side but after the dinner there can be no neutrality br br so we as americans may never be able to fully get over the vietnam war but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it affected so many people emilio estevez certainly did a good job directing also starring corin nemec and carla
