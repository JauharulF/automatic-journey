<START> how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this i can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint i was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 day after tomorrow one line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk br br but br br see the movie despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard in fact you'll probably find yourself down the hatches and riding the storm out why costner and kutcher played their characters very well i have never been a fan of and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian but he surfaced in good fashion costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costner's ability i don't think mrs robinson had anything to do with his success br br the supporting cast all around played their parts well i had no problem with any of them in the end but some of these characters were used too much br br from here on out i can only nit pick so i will save you the wear and tear enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water just don't expect a smooth ride br br 7 of 10 but almost a 6
<START> may or may not contain spoilers br br inuyasha is not a good anime it's actually very overrated why there's absolutely no story line no plot and the show just drags on and on and on that's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again the same episodes seem to go with the same plot sensing a jewel shard a worm slime tentacle demon thing pops up inuyasha says wind scar iron soul stealer etc and kills the demon they get the jewel shard and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times br br besides the repeating of episodes there's the repeating of comedic devices and they're not funny anymore wait they never were sexual harassment is not funny viz rated the series older teens 16 i have no idea why they rated it that there's nothing bad about it except for the so called funny sexual harassment which is kind of suggestive and that could get you arrested these days br br now this is how we know inuyasha is overrated the videogames they all sucked especially the mask game i played that at my friend's house it wasn't anything interesting the game was slow boring and it had nintendo 64 like graphics in a magazine it got a rating of 4 10 saying this role playing game is slower than moving up a cocktail straw then there's all these stupid inuyasha toys action figures trading cards stickers and coloring books coloring books we thought inuyasha was 16 maybe not but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn about half the people on there were 10 to 13 i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show it could be shown on toonami there are over 40 manga volumes i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them sad br br then there's the music the music is so annoying we hear the same 5 songs every episode after 10 episodes the music gets really annoying in other anime they have music to fit the mood and we don't hear some songs very often there are about 15 different inuyasha soundtracks don't waste your money on that garbage br br and how do you think i know all this because i used to be a fan of inuyasha i feel ashamed of myself i'd rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead sadly those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have
<START> absolutely one of the 10 best music films ever a totally essential educational experience for any music fanatic especially young rock punk fans today understanding the beginnings of any particular artistic movement absolutely requires understanding the roots of the music as well as the mindset and musical environment of the times not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time and besides all that this documentary is flat out rock n roll f u n do not miss it that said can anyone tell me when if ever the decline of western civilization part 1 not part 2 the metal version will be made available again hopefully on dvd
<START> i mistakenly thought this was the 70's art film about the bed that eats people which sounded interesting it isn't interesting i mean let alone about a man eating bed br br i assume stuart gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that lloyd kaufman puts troma on just about anything that's been shot with a video camera in the interest of building up a franchise library little more can be said about this opus other than the running time is less than 90 minutes it is of course about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes along the way we get a five minute opening credit sequence is the one for lawrence of arabia even as long a murderer with marylin manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in cat's eye demonstrations of a sexual practice michael hutchence may have employed a preview of what emilio estevez will soon look and act like soft core porn even cinemax would pass on and one topless scene a wacky or is it whack ee ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie well it looked that way to me and a rudimentary surprise ending pos of nothing much it's like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the deathbed before finishing the last draft br br it's not scary it's not sexy it's shot on hi def video and doesn't look bad but doesn't look good either the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else no one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie the modern day double feature i wasn't paying attention for parts of it so i may have missed something but for some reason i doubt it rating pass
<START> i loved this film it was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences without basing the movie solely around them quinn sutherland and kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested the ending was great as well
<START> this is a case of taking a fairy tale too far the enchanted cottage delivers dorothy mcguire as a terrible ugly spinster and robert young as a disfigured pilot long story short scarface marries spinster after which their love transforms them miraculously lighting cosmetics and the removal of fake scars into beautiful magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymooners br br if the story stopped there fine it would be a fable with a proverbial message beauty is in the eye of the beholder but it lurches ahead reaching for reality when mr and mrs scarface greet their public it comes as a painful shock to them that they're still homely you see they only appear beautiful to each a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that ill favored people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy you know take up hobbies spinster does woodcuts for instance scarface considers collecting driftwood br br the original playwright arthur wing and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature their message is you're either ugly or pretty and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one what's even worse ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty reality just won't do br br one wonders what elaine mason saw every day when she looked at her husband stephen hawking
<START> i'll admit that this isn't a great film it practically screams low budget yet oddly i still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it abounded with energy it was like the little engine that could and a movie merged into one br br the film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their low level employees two page boys one very pushy and brash and the other one a wuss as well as a new receptionist all three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their lowly jobs br br into this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue i didn't know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise however like most b mysteries the cops are and it's up to our pushy hero moran to try to save the day throughout all this i had a hard time deciding if moran was obnoxious or endearing i'm still not sure br br there is a moment in the film that is high on the factor' and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians they show up in black face and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of amos n' andy apart from being very insensitive it also wasn't funny fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same way br br overall it's easy to skip this film and i wouldn't blame you if you do however the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic deficiencies of the film and i am glad i saw it a good film no but one that is still worth a peek for fans of old bs br br by the way perhaps i just don't have very good taste but i thought both female singing divas really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their listen for yourself and let me know what you think i just couldn't believe either was allowed to sing on film even if it was just for lowly monogram studios
<START> i'd be hard pressed to say what is it that makes this film so important to me while a very good movie this is definitely not the most outstanding fassbinder's film still along with the american soldier it keeps making it into my personal list of favorites whenever i get to thinking about it
<START> this is one of the oddest movies i have watched in a long while usually if they are this strange i bail out early and rarely regret it luckily i held on for this one while i can't say that this is a great movie it isn't i can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with did i really just see that wonderment lots of laugh out loud moments a great cast of characters with meredith eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughter in law with an attitude keep an open mind
<START> oh my god it just doesn't get any worse than this i always love silly little sci fi b movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the not so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b movies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably not br br i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a non film
<START> i remember vacationing in florida when this movie aired i had set up my vcr to record it the anticipation was killing me i had known about the movie ever since it was announced some half a year earlier we came back from florida 4 days after the movie aired and i immediately watched it i tried as hard as i could to like it but i didn't br br i am a huge 3 stooges fan and as such i know quite a bit about them so it wasn't like i was expecting to learn anything from the movie and i didn't i was more interested with the portrayals and seeing how accurate their information was there were many things wrong with this film the actors the script the reenactments all could have been much better br br paul ben victor is a tremendously talented actor but let's face facts moe howard was way out of his reach he doesn't look like him he doesn't sound like him and thus he can't act like him michael chiklis is also very talented but his portrayal of curly didn't quite score with me although when curly becomes ill he did very well at that john portrayal of shemp could've been rehearsed better it was more of a bad impression than a portrayal worst of all was joe besser they made him skinny and more annoying than he really was it was just plain laziness i don't like the joe shorts because as the movie illustrates he hardly ever got hit but he wasn't that annoying and definately wasn't that thin the best performance belongs to evan handler he had the most accurate stooge portrayal the problem with larry's character his hair is way too frizzy and way too red i know that's too technical so i won't count that on my list of why i didn't like this movie br br back to shemp who just so happens to be my favorite stooge he is written as a whining quivering chicken true he had many phobias but he wasn't that bad he didn't leave the group initially because he was afraid of ted healy although he didn't like him shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply couldn't turn down instead of the truth this movie chooses to make him wet the bed on larry no less run into a closet and shamefully bow out of the group another problem is that shemp made nearly as many columbia shorts as curly did as a stooge but only one fright night which was his first short is shown his career was almost completely ignored plus lousy editing caused a terrible and most unforgivable error shemp was born in early 1895 and died in late 1955 that would make him how old at death well here's a hint it's not 59 as the movie states br br now for the writing which i think was flawed only because this movie was rushed out some of the lines are dumb and could be developed and or introduced much better than they were the one line that really got me was at the very end of the film when moe is showing the promoter how the is done br br that's how we do it make contact with the brow bone not the eyes looks real on film though this line was poorly written and poorly placed in the film it's meant to be one of those lines that make the audience say oh in amazement and i'm sure it did with some people but the very end of the movie was not the place for this line a better place you ask how about when they show up at columbia for the first time and are introduced to the sound effects machine i know initially there was no sound for the but moe for instance could have said what about this and curly or larry jules white then says are you okay or how'd you do that there were a lot of misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was rushed out another one involves the origin of the name shemp although that one isn't as bad and so i will let that one slide br br what does this film do well it illustrates how the stooges were screwed by columbia which they were i'm not sure if moe was an errand boy but that was the kind of dramatization stuff that is meant to get the viewer sympathizing with them i know this film was a dramatization i know not everything is going to be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect however some of the stuff they made up and the real stuff that they ignored were in serious conflict with each other for instance curly's stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life i know i know dramatization but the purpose of dramatizations is to make real events more dramatic curly's stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie here's what really happened curly was sitting in a chair off screen while a scene was being shot they called him for the final pie fight scene but there was no response moe went to go get him and discovered his little brother head slumped half paralyzed unable to speak and tears streaming down his face moe then said babe and tried to help him out of his chair poor curly drops to his knees then the ambulance was called br br all in all this movie wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't good or even ok this film portrays the stooges helplessly and inaccurately and sometimes goes overboard with dramatizations there is a very very long list of inaccuracies in this film if you don't believe me check out a fella named stooge's list at the com news forum it is about a page and a half long some things in the movie i can let slide but others were unforgivable the three stooges were geniuses and a lot of today's comedy is based off of what they did don't believe me check out the simpsons and more so ren stimpy but this film fails to capture their genius it more so inaccurately captures their hardships which is important but if the title of the film is gonna be the three stooges it has to portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything
<START> on one level hari om is a film using a familiar genre the road movie to tell a familiar story curious westerner explores the mysterious east but at its heart the film is about two people a young french beauty bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver hari om with bollywood aspirations from vastly different cultures their slowly growing attraction for each other and the beautiful mad chaos that is india today the gap between them can never be bridged but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an affair as possible without damaging the story's plausibility india and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative and except for the main characters the roles are played beautifully and persuasively by locals recruited during the film's production while on the road between the indian towns and villages that form the film's setting one major negative for this viewer a keystone kops chase near the film's conclusion as hari flees mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt but the closing scenes where and hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable
<START> this is a by the numbers horror film starring richard crenna and joanna pettet as a psychologist duo who purchase and old mansion and invite a small crew of friends and patients to help clean the place up unbeknownst to them the mansion harbors a cellar door the gateway to hell if you are in the mood for a clichÃ©d horror film then look no further but if you want something inventive then this little film won't appeal to you br br violence rather subdued albeit the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw rather gruesome mind you fans of inventive deaths scenes will not like this as every character seems to be electrocuted in some fashion br br nudity nothing to speak of mary louise weller adds the good looks but her character was underdeveloped br br story cliched but view worthy nonetheless this offers nothing new to the genre but the casting of victor buono who is about as menacing as a department store santa seems to have attracted a few viewers br br acting the best performances are by crenna and pettet with the other actors simply phoning in their roles the screenwriter fails to develop any characters outside character and seemed to have forgotten about mary louise weller animal house who disappears for about twenty minutes and only resurfaces to be electrocuted like everyone else in boring fashion
<START> the stuff dreams are made of a complete retelling of the play as a dream of vengeance will baffle purists but will delight the open minded a superb effort great cinematography acting and script 11 stars
<START> this movie has to be seen for the music which is actually a wonderful composed by sergei obviously the original soundtrack is not exactly hi fi but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections the can be appreciated for itself but having seen the movie helps br br the story itself is fairly standard soviet wartime anti german propaganda an amusing anecdote is that stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing hitler at the onset of world war ii that eisenstein was to a german movie for a short while as penance br br prince alexander nevsky revered as a saint by the russian orthodox having earned his nickname by defeating swedish raiders on the river neva musters russian resistance against an invasion by the teutonic knights and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would be invaders br br an interesting scene alexander sees a convoy of russians being taken as slaves by mongolian soldiers and does nothing to stop this as the teutonic knights are his priority the historical alexander nevsky paid tribute to the mongol khans as his father before him while working to consolidate his future independence
