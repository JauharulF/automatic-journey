<START> i first saw this movie at least thirty years ago and it remains one of my all time faves it's a classic the intriguing plot great characters suspense and shocking twist ending all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous big sur coast never get old roy thinnes portrays johnny a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds the acting is great and believable viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger thinnes as i have searched for a copy to buy for years i guess tv movies don't get released to video unfortunately great movie see it if you can find it
<START> this movie is a complete and utter waste of time one of the worst films i've ever seen and coming from me that is definitely saying something in fact i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one star awful br br when i rented this movie i had an open mind i find the legend of the interesting and i have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks but i draw the line at this one br br the acting sucked the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines the lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance but that really doesn't take much br br the well considering how low budget this movie must have been the creature was tolerable it does however look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person but not so on screen br br speaking of on screen you'd think they could have at least used a better camera it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud not a very good one either br br i don't know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking the dialog sucks and just i can't describe what i feel about it at least not without getting in trouble with the site br br my advice avoid this at all costs it's just not worth it if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch then find something else to do or watch read a book listen to music anything just don't subject yourself to this if you do you cannot say you weren't warned and for lord and lady's sake don't rent this sucker it is not worth it even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents trust me i know
<START> when i was five years old it was my favorite television show i remembered it was on channel 11 at everyday the show's premise was simple with carole and janis as the hostesses of this children's television show they sang songs and read stories to us as children it was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re broadcasted over and over i remember sherlock the puppet in the tree the show taught us how to count add subtract and the alphabet for thirty minutes a day now i learned something new with paula and janis i remember those days as pleasant memories and now i hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories inexpensive props riding the swings and talking to puppets the set was ideal and simple but it was carole and janis who made it worth while while i miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the magic garden life seemed so much simpler and better now i hope the kids today enjoy the show
<START> i went into this film expecting a slasher and while mute witness does take influence from said style of film making this is much more than just your average slash flick there are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability blindness is more common blind terror wait until dark cat o'nine tails to name a handful but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of our mute witness is billy hughes a make up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in moscow she finds herself locked in after hours one night and after attempting to phone her sister for help she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick but soon turns out to be a snuff movie she tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen but finds that no one believes her story br br recently hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country but this film did it first and actually does a better job it's maybe not quite as nasty as eli roth's opus but the gore is more effective and since director anthony waller who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'the implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings mute witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch the director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides as this one never stands still the plot is put into action quickly and waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film the acting isn't bad for a b movie with young performers marina fay ripley and evan richards delivering good performances the atmosphere is gritty and the russian locations are suitably unfriendly which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere overall mute witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be the plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are spot on
<START> me being one was probably having a brain fart at the time for renting it anyone who actually buys it will enjoy using this as a coaster perhaps a frisbee this is a dvd i actually found up front where the kids could get to it since dvd's don't seem to be in the position to be put in that tell tale back room with all the big box vhs tapes are i find it rather annoying they stuck this up next to a disney film yep going from dinosaur to erotic ghost has shown what we all think of disney right i stooped that low just yet there's no acting in here the only thing interesting is the old 1973 movie trailers for ancient erotic films that i'm amazed have escape from being burned to hell br br 1 10 if imdb allowed zero's it'd be 0 10
<START> you get a good portion of steven seagal environmental anxieties and some breathless mountain views along with cow boy scenes or alternatively use parts of any remains of the horse whisperer you then add a large piece of outbreak virus or similar attention it must be more lethal and at least biohazard level 4 wrapped around a fat militia group leader you add one of martial arts and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste add the classic red indian herbs for the extra taste serve immediately br br what is the name of the film you get the patriot perhaps the worst film of steven seagal i am sure that seagal tried to say something in this film except the usual i am a cook but also an ex seal but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful
<START> this movie is the best horror movie i have ever seen the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks seriously if you have little kids don't let them see this of course i am a little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and midgets also a body double cameo by the guy who does mini me verne and some gratuitous nudity a must in any low budget horror movie all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book
<START> i don't think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing st v in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some die hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmurs br br i remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first br br favorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought
<START> this is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still i enjoyed it this time charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them death wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and i enjoyed it every single second of it director michael winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and jimmy page providing the music with producers golan and globus still doing there thing and charles bronson is still acting good for paul this movie also made it look like that michael try to end the death wish series and i can't blame him and i love the gun that charles uses death wish 3 is one of the great movies of 1985 and can't get any better than this br br i gives this 9 10
<START> this film is the most impressing turkish film that i have ever seen probably okul is the first turkish horror film i must say that i were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons the first reason is that the story is impressive i mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before this shows that turkish film improves itself by time although the first trial to make a horror movie it was really successful i advice all of you not to miss this movie
<START> a great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later a yugoslavian immigrant in love with the american dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality a prematurely balding undertaker's son a soldier and the crazy hippy girl they all love good direction and a strong cast do justice to steve brilliant script the dialogue isn't as snappy as in breaking away but the themes of growing up and father son conflict are dealt with just as well and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama
<START> i find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws d' martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas capra i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first
<START> i absolutely loved this movie since i don't want to give much away it's basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together it's very heartwarming story between the struggles they have i also think natalie and susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film this is definitely worth seeing two thumbs up way up
<START> radio is possibly one of the best films i have ever seen while at the same time one of the worst it made me laugh in places where you were supposed to cry and made me cringe at moments you were supposed to laugh it lacked any kind of character development which is usually crucial to a sentimental flick that this is some questions why did ed harris character take radio under his wing this was not properly explained and i'm sure their relationship which is the main aspect of the film is the most pointless if ever seen br br who keeps on giving cuba gooding junior work he is a crap actor and should be taunted heavily until he takes up another line of work br br as true stories go this is not that interesting p s the reason i said it is one of the best films i have ever seen is because despite it being complete pap i still enjoyed it laughing at the script and most monologues which are truly the work of either am idiot or someone very clever trying to show how easy it is to release a crappy film about a retard who becomes everyones favourite joke the fact of the matter is cuba's character is comedy fodder for the people who watch the football matches
<START> as a native of new orleans i can state that almost everything in this movie from the atrocious dialect to the highly creative manipulation of crescent city geography is horrible this is another one of those big hollywood movies that decides to stereotype new orleans as 1 a city full of french sounding idiots 2 a city full of people who sound as if they've just returned from blanche summer home 3 a city of drunkards where every day is mardi gras 4 a city of deep mystery where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo i admit that maybe we are a city of drunkards although every day is not mardi gras the big easy is one of the worst films about new orleans i wouldn't recommend it to anybody
