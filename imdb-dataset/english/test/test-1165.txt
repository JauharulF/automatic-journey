<START> if you've been laughing too much for a long time and need to take a break br br after reading about 25 reviews of this show i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv but with somehow worse jokes br br one skit i had the displeasure of watching was the second annual stereotype olympics what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming or gay guy named sparkles that wins a banana eating contest neither of these concepts is particularly novel insightful or amusing do we really need a joke about star wars every episode that movie came out like 30 years ago mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few in there and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money pure comedic genius br br then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched with a your gay if bit you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryan is gay joke it's not like either of those has already been done to death br br unless you're a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies please stay away from this show especially when there are authentic comedians like dave out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful
<START> what fox's fascination with dysfunctional families made up of mean obnoxious spoiled kids and parents who are determined to be cool as opposed to being a parent i'm sorry i don't get it the one episode that i was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a bar with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money of course the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and bes test party of all and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event the ditzy brain dead boy crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between wanting to be jewish and then catholic when she see's the cute religious tutors br br the one borderline heartwarming moment in the entire episode was when the putz of a father who has been convinced the entire time that the bar is solely a money making scheme see's the son studying his hebrew lessons and is momentarily duped into thinking that perhaps his conniving offspring is being sincere about the right of passage into manhood this warm fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a bris a certain procedure needs to be performed the bar is called off and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to comply br br this show is garbage and i am saddened that i shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life i wasted watching this piece of crap because nothing else was on tv
<START> this film was embarrassing in its clichÃ©s poor acting and generally low production values it starts out badly with the long haired 3 star general calling the hero masters major when he is obviously wearing the silver oak leaves of lieutenant colonel but what was most distressing was the crew of soldiers on neptune atoll how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get they were all experts on flying a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comical br br warning this film is dangerous to your intellectual health watch at your own peril
<START> i have just recently seen heaven's gate after i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western i read the book by steven bach after considering all events and the movie itself i still think this movie is a complete waste of time i believe that when someone tells you to watch it they are in fact trying to bore you to death if for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie i have to ask why though this isn't a reason to hate it it is historically way off it pretends to be about a situation that happened in wyoming called the johnson county war simply the cattle of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all you find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then something would happen everybody in the movie talks about things that happen and it is never shown after you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens oh and by the way the johnson county war was not a war it never happened the johnson county war in fact was called that because it almost happened in actual fact 2 people died i can't warn you enough off this movie however if you're like me the the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put united artists on the for sale lot sounds like an interesting case to study then by all means watch this terrible movie with no sub text and a lot of photography which is lovely sometimes
<START> recently finally available in dvd 11 11 08 film and the earth did not swallow him 1994 is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in literature tomÃ¡s rivera's y no se lo la and the earth did not devour him 1972 is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic novel originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the literary landscape br br film originally made as a highly rated american playhouse pbs production has taken some time to be released in dvd one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue the film and now dvd however remains so far as i know the only cinematic adaptation of any novel and clearly is a tribute to earth's incredible staying power this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep rooted nerve that is i maintain both specifically ethnic yet also generally universal doubts about earth perhaps might have arisen because it is too ethnic too alien from a basic american mainstream too much a foreign art indie too limited in economic resources yet perez in his version of art in my opinion connects very effectively artistically and creates a sharply etched portrayal of a migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding simply viewing the film makes manifest this film's or dvd artistic value br br briefly Â and the earth did not swallow him portrays in a neo naturalistic way the plight the suffering and the despair of migrant laborers as they follow the crops from south texas to minnesota in 1952 the local priests bless the beat up overstuffed vehicles of these laborers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the migrant worker this collectivity like the depression era joads in steinbeck's the grapes of wrath forms an epic tide driven by economic need a survival instinct and anguished despair and ultimately a barely flickering faith a tribute to these people of the earth a collective hero the dvd is centered on a focal family and most especially emblematic is a young protagonist within the family a boy perhaps twelve or so this work then also functions as a ultimately the viewer's sense of identification is generated through the experiences subjectivity and the struggles of the protagonist poverty alienation child labor illness and a pregnancy death discrimination school the boy's escapism from the bullies of discrimination is spent lying down in a lovely peaceful cemetery are laid bare as matter of also symbolically worse still the problematic conflict between the youngster and his mother goes beyond socio economics and political conflict into deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics in a desperate but artistically rendered struggle the youth battles his mother an archetypical mexican american traditionalist a representative of god's will content with prayer resignation consolation and acceptance the rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that would permit such evil and suffering to be visited upon them how can god be so cruel he asks since his little sister is certainly purely innocent as to come down with serious illness in the fields at this point the boy must overcome obstacles even more daunting than poverty and discrimination the issues now include death doubt and despair and lack of meaning and he has few resources available to of character his own will power his intelligence and a powerful survival instinct in this desperate but artistically rendered struggle the unnamed youngster the central figure feels the necessity of his enduring of his achieving a heightened sense of meaning and the viewer hopes a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as an inspiration to and others br br this stark battle makes use of a plot device just touched on by the original work to tie the episodic work together missing immigrant laborers from mexico who leave no trace upon their death although this dvd deals not with mexican but mexican american migrant laborers a highly existential work anguish and despair a quest a focus on a project and under the auspices of free will in spite of the deterministic socio economic and religious circumstances br br perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker his many awards are the producer paul is also well known and has been likewise honored for his work the 1994 film in fact won and deserved a number of awards first place audience favorite at the santa barbara film festival in 1995 first place at the cairo film festival and a number of other well deserved awards br br in my opinion this film and dvd earth by perez is the best film that has been made
<START> i was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created i think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did i agree that michelle pfeiffer should have been nominated but i think all the performances were outstanding and that michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity although i didn't read the book i found the modern concept of king lear very cool i certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again
<START> when his elderly mother emily jeanne bates is attacked by her lodger nestor brion james and turns into a cannibalistic monster tv news reporter clay mark thomas miller struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger br br although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy over the top 80s horror titles such as flesheating mothers and rabid grannies mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf vampire zombie mythos exactly what emily becomes is never really clear but it ain't nice as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and son clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all of his other responsibilities including his job and his relationship with pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth mcdonough whilst emily's love for clay ultimately drives her to self destruction br br technically the film could be sharper with more stylish direction and better effects the shots of the creature are kept very brief so as not to disappoint and certain more experienced members of the cast frustrate with terribly cheesy performances yes brion james and stella stevens i am referring to you fortunately however the strong emotional undercurrent in the well constructed story is enough on its own to ensure that mom is an effective compelling and occasionally shocking which i have no hesitation in recommending to those looking for something a little different
<START> don't pay any attention to the rave reviews of this film here it is the worst van damme film and one of the worst of any sort i have ever seen it would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than gunfire and explosions to be entertained br br seeing that this is directed by peter it has made me realise that peter has no talent as a director but is very good at filming explosions and the like however movies need other elements as well for example a story this one didn't have one this might explain the awfulness of some of mr more recent films hardly any better than this one really br br one can't help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera
<START> anyone who critiques as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck just from the title it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously it's as tongue in cheek as a french kiss and just as titillating the female cast members are all great and fun to watch check this out rolfe kanefsky is the clown prince of soft core horror unlike most soft core horror flicks this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses the movie doesn't even attempt to follow the storyline of the robert louis stevenson classic but instead seeks out every way possible to create risquÃ© sight gags and erotic situations blythe the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier homicidal side of jacqueline is a real knockout watch and enjoy
<START> this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it that would be fine if the film were a travelogue but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry that is not good enough the theme of inter species respect and co operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter species love but its approach is stereotypical indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species as with many films one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter alas we probably will never know
<START> sad in every aspect this poor excuse for a career boost for connery was neither that nor the hit warners wanted it to be overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved this film and robocop 2 are proof that irvin kershner did not have any real control over the empire strikes back connery hadn't been in a hit since he bowed out from bond in 1971 but this didn't bring him back at all octopussy was released several months before this film and easily it imagine that a roger moore bond not only better than a simultaneous connery release but it and compared to never octopussy is on par with 2001 br br the worst bond theme song even worse than the man with the golden gun pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence my god who cares and the most atrocious collection of non talent as far as the fabled bond girls go does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie there were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this and barbara carrera just plain stupid but the way kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn't help her out any she is the that would become the very impressive which was about the best feature of goldeneye but that doesn't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film br br casting as a black agent was an excellent idea but the buddy interaction connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together witness the scene where to escape local authorities they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising i can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh
<START> who wrote this flick an uninspired 15 year old br br could have been written by one of the kids who did the columbine shooting br br totally nonsensical not funny all br br plus this the french do not put their flag everywhere you do not walk into a french bank and see the flag displayed like that even on bastille day br br i have nothing against the blood bath thing it's just that none of this is either credible or funny or parodic or anything like that br br ok those who liked this flick will tell you i must be some type of fascist so forget about my comment
<START> this p of s was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great br br similar to mine taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know br br i have no idea what they saw in this movie sadistic cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making or is it lowbrow highbrow br br the ancient generation gap clichÃ© no redeeming social value comes to mind bill pullman is trying maybe a little to hard and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self conscious and kinda lame br br save yourself from this and watch a double feature of in cold blood and the hitcher br br as somebody said this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch's daughter
<START> wow what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to 8mm it wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie br br basically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david and his fiancÃ©e tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute risa the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city the mystery is solved when in the end tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancÃ©e which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end br br i didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene otherwise its a totally different movie it made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn't believe the words coming out of david's mouth the whole time but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble br br there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative br br david was no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he was the main problem long before the end the actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs too because it wasn't even about a last breath nobody really dies but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3 4 long movie br br go rent and maybe buy the original it's one of joel schumacher's better and more original films it has everything better about it from this film i wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges
<START> when jim wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the slumber party massacre series i was ecstatic i had been waiting for a new installment for literally years so production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped then the announcement of a title change no longer would this new sequel be titled slumber party massacre iv but cheerleader massacre instead i was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film i had waited so long to happen i was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it br br maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date a few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them i began to become apprehensive on jim cheerleader massacre br br tonight i got to see the film for the first time in full length and i am still scratching my head as i read in another review cheerleader massacre is definitely not a new installment in the slumber party massacre series but a slasher flick all on its own and a bad one at that br br before i get into the specifics of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of jim films i am i always thought him to be a true camp genius with a winner almost every time yes his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don't contain the most top notch acting around but they're fun nonetheless they are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time from sorority house massacre ii to hard to die to chopping mall jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion one of the reasons why i was excited that this film would be his latest project br br cheerleader massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films i had seen this director writer create in the past firstly the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape something i had never seen jim do before the actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa rather than an escaped lunatic br br of course the film is littered with female nudity this is a jim wynorski movie we're talking about folks but some of the boob shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time there is an extremely long shower scene containing the cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in jim's sorority house massacre ii the girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way br br cheerleader massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least the opening scene is literally something we've all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks a guy and a girl making out on the verge of their relationship when you guessed it they're hacked to pieces br br brinke stevens who i've never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo we're talkin' possible cue cards here she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original slumber party massacre plays why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new i have no idea there is also two explosions seen in this movie that i am almost certain were recycled from other films br br not only does this film recycle footage from past films but it also recycles the scores from other films as well some of the music used in humanoids from the deep which was also recycled prior for the coroner can be heard throughout the entire film there are at least two more as well that i cannot identify but am certain have been used before br br after sitting through this film's horrendous acting ridiculous story non existent gore special effects and camcorder like quality i am having some serious concerns toward mister career has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche only time will tell oh and let's not forget his newest film a new installment in the sorority house massacre films now titled final exam i think i'm seeing a pattern here
