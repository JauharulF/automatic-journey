<START> the quote above just about says it all for slipstream i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance i won't watch it again so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichÃ©d lines in the movie i'm sure it will set a record br br some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry paxton's character has hijacked hamill's prisoner an android taking his name from the poet byron bob peck hamill shoots owens paxton with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion kitty aldridge can keep tabs on the pair the real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the br br if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense then i suppose you'll find something of interest here but you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with all over his torso if anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here you're really stretching br br patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming the end to come into view alas even that was denied if beauty is in the eye of the beholder then so is understanding this movie had neither yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons apparently the film was keeping them afloat
<START> heh i'm surprised this movie still exists in any form let alone it being available for rent br br this flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the t a and the cheap laughs the story line crosses a bit of texas chainsaw massacre with a screwy centred back story reminiscent of psycho and a bit of the good old women in chains tough as nail ex con broads tossed in for good measure in other words complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of quebec pass off as southern u s bayou land is sad i tell ya br br funny thing for me is i was actually at the premier of this flick as at the time i was pals with the film's star it was painful to watch on as jeremy sank into his seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wings br br i'm happy to see that after this sham of a first flick has grown into one hell of an actor he can be seen regularly on the canadian cop drama blue murder has appeared on csi not to mention his role in the classic clint eastwood film unforgiven we forgive ya jeremy it was a rocky start but you done good man br br t paul
<START> in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash however the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band i recognized the music as being a band called and the album was just a nightmare and it was very well written and i am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it if can remember back that far i would appreciate the feed back i collect old movie and obscure movie sound tracks it is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album not to bad hugh
<START> this movie baffled me i could not get a grip on it thought i might be missing something glad to see that most of you agree with me this isn't always the case see my recent review of re extinction br br to expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time so i will br br they're dressed like cowboys but it's modern times right no i don't get it when i picked up the box i thought zombie western cool that's how it was presented haven't seen that yet hope they did a good job br br they didn't they tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series they didn't br br they tried to make an aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber and perhaps riding on the coat tails of the very well done undead they didn't br br okay maybe they just wanted to make a confusing disjointed mess of film salad that might ultimately be edited into something watchable they didn't this is the new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies ever there are really just the two so far day of the dead being the first not to be confused with day of the dead which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time if you're gonna make a zombie movie and i'm not a zombie movie maker i'm just a connoisseur make a good one flight of the living dead is a good example of decent recent zombie filmaking fyi br br if you're really forgiving you might think well didn't they at least throw in something to make us feel like we didn't want our money back guess what they didn't
<START> you have to have lived in japan for awhile to enjoy the beauty of this movie i lived on okinawa for over 2 years and northern for 4 believe it or not what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of contrasting east west mentalities both from a sports as well as personal relationships perspective a funny funny and heartwarming movie that deserves better than americans viewing it can ever judge 8 out of 10
<START> definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be nightmare in wax tells the story of a man having had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene wreak his vengeance on those directly responsible and those indirectly for the losses in his life most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress cameron mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair albeit limited flair actually i thought he gave one of his better performances what exactly does that mean mitchell wears an eye patch endlessly smokes cigarettes wears a motley tunic and talks to his creations in wax they are not your ordinary wax dummies but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological function they become zombies in effect i thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else it has some ludicrous explanation but does serve the plot this is a film of the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic camera work by bud townsend and company the acting is mediocre but mitchell scott brady and barry give interesting turns the wax figures of hollywood's bygone era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible the end of the film dissipates into something not quite real either another example of 60s cultural cinema or the end of the scriptwriter's creativity i'm banking on the latter despite its many flaws i enjoyed the film the opening scene showing an actor being was effectively done as was a police chase on the waterfront
<START> everyone wants duvall and jones back come on viewers are saying things like and urban aren't as deep were you as deep when you were young that's the whole point they have a lot to learn and urban pull off the shallow innocence they were directed to act and with superb commitment to preserving the nuances of duvall and jones' input into the characters is flagrantly perfect as the early gus and urban is subtly perfect as the early woodrow what a bold move it must have been for them to take on such a position in the entertainment industry they must have known they would have everyone coming down on them for not actually being the beloved originals yet they clearly put the best effort forward i gave it a 7 because the editing was choppy in places and time lines were sketchy but the acting was a joy to watch val kilmer was absolutely great one more thing i expect audiences would have been more accepting of the mysticism implied by the appearances of a jaguar and blue and gold macaw if more effort had been put into the way they appear and are so simply accepted by the characters
<START> i would rate this film high on my list of ingrid bergman films ingrid's beauty aside her talent is evident in scene after scene she was sad mean witty br br snobbish flirtatious delightfully funny loving tender sorrowful distressed happy etc you name it she was all those things and more and so br br convincing ingrid plays a notorious woman clio who comes back to new br br orleans and falls for a texas gambler gary cooper clint i especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing just staring at each other she in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboy br br outfit sitting there looking at her adoringly what chemistry what love
<START> surprisingly good made for t v thriller i wasn't expecting too much from this one but i'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind it's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events br br the story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits you can't help but find the movie very interesting br br the background story of character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father br br the stranger concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society a serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way br br my beef with the movie was the non sense situation when character returns home with her deranged husband after he's released on bail by that moment she knew what he did to his young relative played by the cute allyson hannigan but that's just the typical hollywood scene that provokes more trouble br br the climax scene shows thiessen following her husband when he's about to commit another rape then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him the ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life br br the acting is also pretty good and tiffany is great and gorgeous as always the direction is also very good
<START> this movie has to be the worst film of 2007 it was just really bad and i don't think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad i mean the don't make really bad hollywood films do they hamish really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just can't act at all god he was just so bad i mean he was that bad in the film that he made mallika look like a better actress than him as for her performance she plays the same role in every movie god it is just so boring watching her i mean what do men see in this woman yeah she has a god body but where is that talent i have not seen it yet and at this rate i don't think that i ever will br br anyway hamish falls in love with ria now this 15 year old girl can act my god she was the best actor in the film and she does not look 15 at all to me she looks about 21 but her performance was brilliant in the film bless her she was really good i hope to see more of her in the future so ria falls in love with but her father wants her to marry someone else a typical bollywood film anyways there is a hiccup can only happen in a bollywood film and the both get married in the end br br well i would give th music 10 10 it was superb that made the movie a hit the songs were truly amazing and brilliant anyways the only thing that i can say is to go and buy the music and not watch the film
<START> this story focuses on the birth defect known as or fetal alcohol syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among native americans in spite of the down beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well this is arguably best performance
<START> jb jack black runs away from home after being spanked by his father meat loaf years later he finally makes it to hollywood and comes across the greatest guitar player he has ever heard kyle glass br br after a little squabble the two decide join forces and perform at an open mic night at what appears to be a less than popular bar to their shock they don't do that good br br back at their less than spectacular apartment the two are trying to figure out what the legends of rock have that they don't while looking at some old magazines it's only then that they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar pick br br while trying to look for a similar pick an employee of the music shop ben stiller who is also the film's executive producer tells him the ancient story of the pick of destiny of which they seek this employee who has long gray hair and thick glasses also tells them that the pick which was made from satan's tooth is in a history of rock museum br br now the two pot smoking losers with delusions of grandeur goes on a music filled adventure to steal the pick br br let me say this up front if you are not a fan of tenacious d which gave us the comedy actor jack black then you should skip this one i am not a fan of these two and only watched it because it was suggested by com br br the jokes for the most part produce silence more than anything i laughed at maybe three of the jokes and chuckled at a few others tenacious d is only for a certain audience of which i am not br br this movie lags in numerous places and this is where the worst jokes appear and let me say that when black and glass are not working off one another they are completely lost on screen br br all the songs in this movie is by and performed by tenacious d many of the songs perfectly advance the storyline by describing their adventures at the time in the film however i felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apart br br another problem with this film is that the language will turn off a lot of people there are a lot of four letter words in this film there are also some drug references i would not recommend this for children br br part of tenacious d's schtick is that black is in your face and glass stays in his shadows for the most part this is how they are in this movie and it doesn't really work now this may have been part of the act but i felt that glass just didn't want to be there in one scene he performs his background lyrics at a party and he just can't work alone br br tenacious d are supposedly rock fans in real life and have maybe two rock legends in the movie i lost count because i was so bored with this film personally i would have liked to have seen more rock legends and icons in the film however we don't get that br br what we do get is a movie filled with completely lame jokes lots of foul language a lackluster script you also get horrible acting and an unoriginal story however you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the same br br the story could have been promising but many of the scenes appeared to have been added into the film at the last second this is somewhat similar to the blues brothers movie many years ago but the blues brothers had a much bigger following and two songs on the billboard music charts tenacious d only has a small following with a few hbo specials under their belt and unlike the blues brothers the comedy is not well thought out at all br br if you are a hard core fan of tenacious d then i suggest you check it out however like most of the movie audience when this film was released to theaters i would say avoid this one save your money on this one folks
<START> wow what a movie if you want to blow your budget on the title and have it look real bad ask the guys that made this movie on how to do that they could have spent the money on a good rewrite or something else or they could have spent it on beer when they made this movie at least it would have come out better
<START> this film has a premise that is good enough to get anyone talking and a sure fire conversation starter you sleep with someone you dislike or don't know for one million dollars ' while the film had lots of potential poor execution turns it into a b grade soap opera the film has a great lead up and after the proposal is made we are really into the film but then it falls dramatically the last 3 quarters of the film is spent by characters whinging complaining and regretting what they have done the ending was so cliched it had me in tears this has a very similar premise to in vegas' which is far better see that instead
<START> this was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen the acting was god awful the story line also was bad it was however a good idea if this movie would have had better cinematics and a lot better actors i might of had something better to say edgar allen poe was a great gothic writer and this movie just destroyed it why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going that was pretty good the swinging axe was just horrible there was absolutely no suspense and also when the killer is chasing everyone around in the end he was going from one place to another in just seconds it makes absolutely no sense
