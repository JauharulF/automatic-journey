<START> after his earlier movie videodrome which definitely shows similarities to this movie director david cronenberg again ventures himself in the world of virtual reality in which truth and fiction mix it's virtual reality taken to a whole other level br br is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written the movie features a fascination and well thought out concept which gets greatly executed by director david cronenberg br br is a movie that knows to constantly fool you just when you thought you figured things out another surprise awaits around the corner things are never like how you think they are especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored you just never really know what is the reality and what is the game world right till the ending it makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more br br the movie has a perfect kind of game play storytelling mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events they have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is br br the movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism without ever going over the top with either one the storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its events dialogs and unusual environments br br the movie is not only just weird though i was actually surprised to see that videodrome has an higher rating on here thought it's a far more inaccessible and 'odd' movie the movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace it doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings it also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies br br the movie is good looking with subtle effective special effects a great visual look that also provides the movie with a certain required feeling br br the movie is well cast with jude law in a role you don't too often see him in that of a shy insecure person it once more shows how actually versatile law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from hollywood jennifer jason leigh also was a great female lead she hasn't really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star the movie also features some other well known actors in much smaller roles such as ian holm and willem dafoe br br an highly original movie that is well worth watching especially if you have seen videodrome previously br br 8 10
<START> i rented this movie knowing that it would be bad i have only seen one good disney sequel and that was toy story 2 but it went far lower than my expectations i am a die hard disney fan and i just don't believe in sequels with disney movies for somebody who didn't grow up with the classics either watching them when they came out or renting them since you were born it's a cute story i just feel that the plot was dragged out a little too much and was to predictable the one thing that annoyed me the most was the voices of the girl children of lady and tramp they were too high pitched although most reviews say that it isn't that bad i think that if you are a true disney fan you shouldn't waste your time with this one br br hopefully disney won't be making any more sequels to any of the other classics any time soon
<START> i looked forward to seeing this movie because the trailer made it look so cool but the fact is that this movie is boring and totally muddled there is no plot and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games zoomed in shots that gives you no overview of the games i was constantly looking at the timer to see when the movie was over br br there's only one good thing about this movie the sound the soundtrack is awesome don't expect anything from this movie
<START> i saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me and we both had the same feeling about it it wasn't terribly motivating and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like so that non could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one in fact there was almost zero technical information at all i didn't expect this to be a tech heavy instructional video but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced and wasn't particularly useful to non contemplating their first run br br there were other problems some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race yeah real inspiring the timing was also hard to follow because it was semi chronological but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at and they withheld information you see that has an injury and you just assume it's from all her training but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard br br some parts were very good though like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men only and the coverage of a chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place br br off the top of my head i'm thinking of other chronological documentaries like supersize me and grass where you always know where you are and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know br br in short it wouldn't have been hard to make a better marathon film and as it stands i can't recommend this to non to educate and motivate them to try one because i don't think it will have that effect
<START> this film immediately catches the eye with the atmospheric aerial views of a very pretty hong hong filmed in those rich colours of 1950 films which modern blockbusters never seem to capture probably a sign of those times because this is not a high powered seen it all before film full of havoc and violence the havoc and violence are there though in the backdrop with thousands of refugees trying to get out of china this is a very moving and compelling story full of hope and love in a tragic time in recent history the story of two people from different cultures falling in love and the build up to them trying to overcome this is the heart of this very fine and moving film
<START> i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest first of all one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies it is a thriller get it right it has no monsters or anything supernatural it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me the basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film one of these girls turns out to be a local detective's daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain howdy carleton played adequately by writer producer twisted sister frontman dee snider the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from snider are laughable if he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film he fails miserably and unintentionally makes light of them the directing by john whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women which i will let the title speak for itself was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot unless the screenplay is at fault which is quite possible this film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that's only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings if you see it at your video store don't waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and is on cable you might as well watch 3 out of 10
<START> this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself oh i want to learn more about custer's life and his last do not rent they died with their boots on' but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch br br the story starts out with custer's errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havilland br br errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laugh br br the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the director's portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him br br i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film
<START> sadly every single person i ask about this series says they've never heard of it i remember it fondly from my early childhood i wasn't quite 10 when it came out br br my favorite story was a story short something about the way the stone soup story was woven into a greater story gets me every time and then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell and it becomes a story itself i've always been a fan of jim henson and this is just one reason why br br i'm adding this dvd on the self with labrynth the dark crystal the neverending story the princess bride the last unicorn willow and mirrormask these are all dvds i share with my siblings who are 6 5 and 4 yrs old
<START> i'm rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving br br the basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent if provocative idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship but one if i can judge by the real life examples i've known is extremely deep and loving br br however the film is cheaply scripted poorly scripted and although it has a number of very pretty looking shots i didn't find it to be anything special br br probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly composed to give its audience time enough to invest emotionally in the characters we don't really care about any of them and so their stresses and obstacles don't really touch us br br i think a remake from the screenplay up with some character development by some really good writers could improve it greatly it is instructive to compare this film with brokeback mountain which the screen writers took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplay screen writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy and carried out their task with care planning and superb craftsmanship however people only seem to remake those films that don't need it you're not really missing anything if you skip this one i found it very disappointing indeed and it is only saved from getting a 1 star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject
<START> aka br br aspect ratio 3 x 1 78 1 within 2 39 1 frame triptych br br sound format dolby digital br br 1978 a working class teenager matthew leitch assumes a false identity and high society where he learns harsh lessons about the divisions between rich and poor br br autobiographical feature by director duncan roy jackson my life your fault an exposÃ© of the pre thatcherite aristocracy as seen through the eyes of a low rent whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the upper classes unfortunately roy's screenplay says very little we didn't already know about the excesses of the idle rich and the narrative is only briefly ignited by relationship with a handsome but self destructive rent boy peter youngblood hills who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate also starring diana quick as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are embarrassed to be alive bill nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family lindsay coulson eastenders blake different for girls and georgina hale in a typically flamboyant cameo flashing her boobs at all and sundry without a care in the world br br unfortunately much of the film's impact is diluted by roy's insistence on using a triptych effect three separate 1 78 1 images are letterboxed within the 2 39 1 frame each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on screen a long pointless film too personal for wide appeal and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand a single image version is also available framed theatrically at 1 85 1 with the on screen title aka lies are like wishes
<START> hell to pay was a disappointment it did not have anywhere near the substance of a b western movie and should in no way be compared to a fantastic movie like silverado the dialog was dull the plot was torpid the soundtrack was overbearingly unnecessary and the acting was awful even the professionals could've taken some lessons from the sunset carson school of acting the only positive thing about this movie is that it showcased some of the top cowboy shooters in the nation but you can see them in a better light in any sass video the packaging of this feature makes it very enticing and the preview is decent but it's all over after that
<START> my bad film guru and the president of the exposed film society sprang this one on us last week there was no denying the demented gleam in his eye as he pulled it out of its brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us the most dangerous game filmed on a budget of about 2 95 br br of course 2 95 went a lot further back in 1962 but still br br anyway there is certainly a lot to dislike about this film it abounds with serious technical gaffes my favorite was the that fired twice in two minutes without benefit of a reload the hero is a wuss who stands by while his wounded friend fights the henchman and gets killed br br more ok the plot is a shambles with no continuity to speak of the movie wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' who serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia but never shows him again the hero is choked unconscious by the henchman but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and first meets his host the mute servant girl is captured put on the rack and then the movie and the hero who put her in this predicament just sort of forgets about her br br more well the sets are cheap and the special effects are cheaper the makeup is an exception to this much of the plot is carried by the narrator's droning monotonic voice over which carries less dramatic impact than the menu recital at denny's most of the dialog is simply ridiculous and stilted as if it was translated from japanese i demand that our conversation be pleasant and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day note this last may have been the fault of a bad print rather than the camera crew br br but there were a couple of nice moments here and there the makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film the actors were looked interesting especially the mute servant girl and the countess and in spite of everything there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found very nasty and disturbing br br so what was the deal with this movie i thought about it a bit and realized that director writer pat basically tried to put a story from of the old ec horror comics on film that would account for the stilted dialog the sketchy character development in a comic character even more than in film the loopy interior logic of the story ec horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty shock ending and weren't big on psychological realism the over reliance on the narrative voice which belongs in captions over the panels and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the grisly pictures that the old ec artists did so well br br in fact i'd be willing to bet that when saw his leading man during casting he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky shambling figures and caved in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world he used costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living ec comics characters see the leading lady's blank beauty the count's strong bony features oddly bronze skin and sharp chin the platinum 'do on the tall bony black henchman etc br br this would explain the movie's failings knew how to 'frame' things but he didn't know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him he wouldn't be the first person with this problem of course look at what joel schumacher did to batman but he didn't have a big budget to hide behind br br in any case i'm imagine that walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about dungeon of harrow than the folks who post on this film's message boards he did within certainly vague boundaries what he set out to do and you have to respect him for it even if you don't care for harrow
<START> son of the mask is a terrible movie i don't like the baby and i don't like the dog jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage even at only 88 minutes or so it says the movie could not end soon enough for me the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben stain that's it the rest is just a rehash of the first movie actually that is just an insult to rehashes why was this sequel made this movie cost millions of dollars to make why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie i am not bothering to be nice to this movie 1 10
<START> a sick man carleton dee snider cruises the teen chat lines as captain howdy he poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over his house to party he instead knocks them out strips them sews their mouth closed and tortures them mostly with needles he captures the daughter of cop mike gage kevin gage he finds him arrests him and he's institutionalized four years later he's released totally cured but a lynch mop led amusingly by robert englund attack him and hang him he doesn't die but he snaps and captain howdy is back br br a very sick disturbing twisted horror film captain howdy enjoys pain and torture and is trying to show the kids he kidnaps how to enjoy it also the torture scenes aren't that explicit you hear more than you see but what you do see is very very sick there's no humor and the muted screams of his victims sound way too real i was cringing away from the tv during most of the scenes br br the acting varies kevin gage isn't that good as the cop he's not terrible but he could have been better dee snider is very scary as captain howdy his attack scenes are not pleasant br br all in all not your typical horror film i'll probably never see it again this film really gets under your skin but i recommend it to all horror fans at least those with strong stomaches i give it a 7
<START> turning somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster but it wasn't the story moves at a rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin fun
