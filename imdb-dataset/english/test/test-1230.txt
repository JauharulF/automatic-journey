<START> while it may not be his most laugh packed film mighty like a moose stands as one of charley chase's most satisfying farce comedies twenty minutes of clever sight gags nicely choreographed physical comedy and amusing quips rendered via title card of course all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise we're told up top that this is a story of homely people a wife with a face that would stop a clock and her husband with a face that would start it again soon we meet buck toothed charley moose and his wife vivien who has an enormous nose but there's no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences i e first that charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed second that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other and third that when bumping into each other in public afterward charley and vivien wouldn't recognize each other sounds like a bit of a stretch doesn't it multiple stretches is more like it clearly we're in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility you're likely to enjoy this short br br mighty like a moose gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established but things pick up once charley and vivien have met and made a date to attend a party together at the home of dentist they each rush home excitedly enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence mr mrs moose appear to be quite wealthy incidentally as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel there follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of buster keaton's the navigator in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up face to face and once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower gale henry henry an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914 is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing there's also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of charley gale vivien and dance partner yet we're able to follow precisely what's happening between the principles by watching their feet br br unfortunately for charley and vivien the party they're attending is raided and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home when charley realizes that his newly wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson while conveniently forgetting of course that he was attempting to do the very same thing the last few minutes of this film offer some of chase's funniest physical comedy capped with a good sight gag for the punchline mighty like a moose leaves the viewer with a warm glow and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific sadly underrated charley chase
<START> old bat transforms to younger ok looking girl after drinking a potion this movie was dreadful the acting atrocious the camera work made me head spin and it features the longest most excruciatingly boring strip tease ever put to film piero should be ashamed for directing this eduardo been blacklisted just for writing something so awful don't rent this movie the only exception i can this of is maybe if you're dying and only have less then 90 minutes to live watch this film cause it will feel like an eternity and you'll be begging the grip reaper come a little early br br my grade f
<START> when i first saw this i thought bits of it were fairly scary but the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them there are some genuinely good moments such as angela's speech about demons and the briefly seen demon itself is effective but this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis it's all pretty tacky and cheap looking and often downright silly pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror the music is excellent however and the epilogue is certainly amusing but this film doesnt have much to recommend it just comes across as another jason type stalk and slash fare
<START> tyrone power was cast in the lead as solomon however part way through the film he died unexpectedly the studio chose to cast yul brynner in the lead and re shoot the scenes that power had done in hindsight considering how awful this film was power was lucky as this would have been a horrible way to end his lovely film career br br of all the biblical epics i have seen this one is by far the worst and that's saying a lot because hollywood has made many dull biblical tales so many you wonder if the creation of these films was an atheist conspiracy in fact the film was so dull that it deservedly was included in harry brilliant book the fifty worst movies of all time there are so many reasons to hate the film but the worst is how incredibly ponderous the whole thing was sure casting people with italian eastern european scottish and english accents to play egyptians and israelis was pretty bad but at least this made the film oddly humorous having bosomy gina lollobrigida playing the role of a woman reputed to have come from a place around ethiopia was also just awful but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn't act having an overweight and post middle aged george sanders play such a young role was also pretty bad but at least he had a pretty voice creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and revoltingly dull was pretty bad but at least you got to see in the credits a mention of a person as the orgy choreographer no the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours it seemed like nine it was so poorly paced and insipid considering that the only mention of this queen of sheba and solomon is only in a few measly verses in the old testament it's amazing the film just went on and on and on the greatest story ever told was a bit longer but that movie was based on four gospels not a dozen or so verses br br the bottom line is that the film is wretched in practically every way except for gina's cleavage even for devoted christians and jews this is a must avoid film because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as well as injects an amazing amount of sex into a biblical film terrible in almost every way it is truly a blessing for tyrone power that he's not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey
<START> the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes when sharif or please god palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling in the ocean and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass what does that leave us with one comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro's manic and unremitting cigar fellatio never trust a medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a historically awful movie
<START> as a fan of wm faulkner since college i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons my grandfather also named clarence brown as was the director grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888 we attended a week long family reunion at oxford in july 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss my recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white i was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story br br now days oxford is a larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare one of the best was a pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often
<START> pete's meteor i seen this referred to as authentic and a gem i caught this movie on a saturday afternoon i kinda wished that i didn't br br apparently this was noted as being mike myers' first dramatic role unfortunately it had to be this movie the first thing you'll notice that pete's meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot or rather a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere young orphan mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother a meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named hugh despite the title of the movie mickey is the one who lays claim to the meteor and the storyline actually has little to do with the meteor in any shape or form from here on out several other characters and subplots are introduced but like i said before they don't really go anywhere br br things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty fast when pete mike myers is introduced and starts to play a role micky blames him for the death of his parents though we're never really told what happened or why hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination and pete's drug related past starts to catch up with him and temporarily draws his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him this would seem to be the main plot until you realize it doesn't even have a role until halfway through the film making everything else feel like pointless filler hugh's girl problems bad behavior the meteor what on earth do they have to do with this not much br br so the 'plot' is disjointed and half of it is pointless but a good cast of characters can save it right keyword good the majority of characters are terribly unlikable people most of which you'd like to see die horribly at least i know i would despite the title mickey seems to be the main character which is a really bad move once you see him in action he is one of the worst little kids i've seen in a movie with an extremely bad attitude problem he a car harasses and talks trash to hugh an adult for taking the meteor actually attempts burn the man's house down when he doesn't get his way and even tries to stab pete with a knife you'd think a kid like this is on his way to the jail house unfortunately one of the worst things about this movie is that mickey never gets what's coming to him i'm not sure at what point you're supposed to be sympathizing with his character because he's always a nasty little brat he's the ringleader for his brother and sister so they predictably end up taking and backseat and just following whatever he does amazingly they're pushed back so far that i can't even remember their names they might as well not even be there br br their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic she tends to be just as nasty to hugh as mickey and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil glares when she's not down liquor bottles and drinking herself silly pretty ridiculous when you take into account that she's supposed to be taking care of three children her issues with alcohol are never really addressed though she does collapse from time to time in the movie br br hugh is one of the few likable characters in the movie but that's only because he's the punching bag for the majority of characters and takes their mess without giving it back the kids treat him but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do nice things with them he's got a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense attempting to leave him several times in the movie when he goes off into his cosmic lingo or does something to prove that he isn't exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters thankfully br br then there's mike myers as pete pete despite having the only solid purpose and plot in the movie is extremely underused and doesn't play any kind of role until the second half it's unfortunate that myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role even when pete is getting screen time half of it is just myers running through dark alleys and hiding in small corners and even though he was the only real point to this movie when his plot line brings the movie to a close it's a strange unfulfilling conclusion that has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie making you wonder if they were just performing in the movie you were just watching br br the only thing worth seeing in pete's meteor is mike myers' role as pete and that's if you can wade through this disjointed mess long enough without lashing out at another human being due to the extremely unlikable characters and nonexistent plot line no sir i didn't like this one at all
<START> a tale of a young boy dexter joseph with aids who befriends a rough and tumble boy played by brad his exact opposite the cure is sad if a bit too soapy pull at your emotions message movie with it's heart in the right place for that fact alone it's a recommended view the highlight might be just watching them finding friendship and hanging out with each other when no one else accepts them br br however since the real story centers on the boy's aids things take off when one day at the local supermarket dexter's eye catches a checkout tabloid magazine that states a new orleans doctor has discovered the cure both of them obviously a tad naive make it a plan to set out for new orleans in whichever means possible which kinda pulled me two ways it's a mite heart warming and i hate to nit pick but i found the plot wanders in a melodramatic predictable sense and the proceedings have a coat of gloss over them like only movies can do i couldn't escape the tugging notion i was watching a road trip movie about self discovery sickness and growing up for instance i know they're young but i found it a real task to belief in the things these boys do like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the ravaging disease to say nothing of them making a cross country voyage as they do with no legal or downright scary repercussions still misgivings aside those movie conventions you come to expect it's a story worth seeing particularly with family
<START> an unjustly neglected classic intruder in the dust is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity based on a story by william and shot in his hometown of oxford mississippi intruder tells the story of lucas played with great dignity by hernandez a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man and a white boy claude jarman jr who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to terrific acting especially by two great character actors porter hall as the dead man's father and elizabeth patterson best known as mrs on i love lucy as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done this straightforward tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more
<START> i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films and it shows we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting but that's not what we watch him for although there have been a few earthquakes in california since this movie was made there never was any desert or hills between hwy 99 and i 5 billy was supposedly crossing over from 99 to 5 along 120 a distance of less that 15 miles i wish that the writers producers and directors of these movies would at least look at a map as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california i could tell right from the start that the geography was wrong however there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half so grab your doritos and an adult beverage and enjoy a trip back in time
<START> i loved it in fact i watched it over and over and over and i could watch it again this movie doesn't get boring br br the vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie it's a job well done great for today's generation br br wesley snipes was born for this role stephen dorff was an ideal vampire arly jover mmmm mmm she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has donal provides great comical relief br br this vampire movie is like no other i can't wait for blade 2
<START> i saw this movie unfortunately because it was the only option at that time and because david zucker was the director i saw his previous naked gun both parts airplane and top secret and i liked at least i had a good time and laughed i'm not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces but were ok i don't recall any other more stupid movie than this it's incredible how hollywood industry is in total decadence if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days this is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people i don't have any good to say about this film if you are planning to rent it or buy it please don't waste your money or your time avoid it no matter what even if you are fan of one of the actors does not worth it in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid i won't see a zucker movie again he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie imagine that pathetic awful
<START> taylor mrs drake english 10 b4 31 march 2010 br br a shot in the dark br br it is difficult to make it through the movie heart of darkness because it is incredibly unexciting the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with so the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally off handed idea anyways basically guaranteeing a fail br br most of the book is of the mental travel of a young seaman named marlow on a job through the many of the congo and people as a feel like the screenwriter failed massively at capturing the essence of marlow's travels it totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark that is the major point in the book and when that doesn't translate to the movie all that's left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony br br this being the case the question is posed why would anyone make this into a movie an even better question could then be asked who would want to watch it it is utterly a chore to watch had it not contributed to a grade in my english class i would have never even considered watching the movie i would never recommend this movie to anyone heart of darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when it's taken from the pages of the book the novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so but the afterthought is that it is a pretty decent book the movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target br br how can a book that's all about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical visual sense i feel like it's impossible to accurately show thoughts also i feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that don't seem to add up at all the novella heart of darkness was published in 1902 while the movie version of heart of darkness is from 1993 the 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different the novella seems to have much harsher conditions and the movie does not portray the prehistoric feel of the congo the congo in the movie just seems like another place not the dark inhuman place that the book paints this setting of i feel like this removes another major element that really contributes to the novella br br with two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie the little bit of decency that is in the book heart of darkness is gone when the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly it is it's dull unexciting and a major waste of time there's no reason to watch it the book is stripped of any significance it has if it's necessary for some reason read the book avoid the movie at all costs br br cast and credits marlow tim roth kurtz john malkovich the russian morten the intended phoebe nicholls br br directed by nicolas roeg written by benedict fitzgerald based on the novella by joseph conrad running time 100 minutes rated pg 13 some sexuality and language
<START> i turned over to this film in the middle of the night and very nearly skipped right passed it it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it in the end i thought it was great br br an interesting storyline good characters a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch this was in fact the first i'd heard of this movie but i would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema br br my imdb rating 8 out of 10 br br
<START> some friends recommended this but as a film it's really lacking in originality i found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning however if you like traditional english appalachian ballads it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one i've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie with professional musicians filling in for the actors
