<START> captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains the movie follows the plight of david letterman and jay leno as they struggle for the elusive tonight show spot letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and leno led by his agent and little devil on the shoulder helen br br kathy bates is excellent in this movie alienating herself from such top dogs as bob wright warren littlefield and howard stringer towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping that you find yourself wanting more br br john michael higgins letterman plays his part to the tee at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real letterman br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations
<START> that's a weird weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than david lynch's one the special effects are badly made the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the but it seems to be a crazy movie which pays homage to sect kind of organisations that's surely not the will of frank herbert the author of the six part epic check out david lynch's one that's the perfect tribute to the novels
<START> this movie is not a remake of she's all that 1999 br br where is the renewal of the american movie this was probably the worst movie i saw in the last 5 years this and the last movies of schwarzenegger br br
<START> it seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the second world war it stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is dark blue world a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war does not tell the story of many of its major figures and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or axis powers dark blue world instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations br br the film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by czech pilots flying under the british royal air force expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language barrier between them and the other fliers but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the germans until being re trained br br dark blue world also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships a love triangle develops between the two main characters and an english woman that complicates the teacher mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers this relationship is extremely well acted throughout developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points br br the aerial combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines fight the enemy and relay commands and replies in an unfamiliar language the tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air br br this may not be a film for everyone the hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off putting but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not
<START> when i first saw this film around 6 months ago i considered it interesting but little more but it stuck with me that interest grew and grew and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchased the criterion dvd box set and it turns out that i was right the second time alexander nevsky is a great film it is rousing and i'm sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the germans br br that is the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it is merely propagandist and nothing else it's untrue he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived by now the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein's films as art
<START> this is easily the best cinematic version of william fiction that i've ever seen and i've seen several of the most prominent ones filmed in hometown of oxford mississippi it really captures the feeling of jefferson and county intruder in the dust is not one of best novel but even if it is a clichÃ© to say this it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career it beats harper lee's good but simplistic to kill a mockingbird fifty feet into the ground i read that one in ninth grade and that's exactly where it belongs two of most prominent characters play major parts in the film gavin stevens and lucas stevens is probably the single most common character in all of fiction he's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator because unlike many of his other characters stevens is a man of logic not emotion at least when he's older lucas may be the most prominent of all of black characters he plays a major part in one of out and out masterpieces go down moses unlike all of the other black folks in he refuses to bow down to any white man he has pride and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man one day lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recently fired pistol in his possession most of jefferson and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial and everyone's pretty sure that will be lynched before the evening's over or at least the next day as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday on the other hand declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him stevens refuses the case seems open and shut but his young nephew chick because lucas had helped him in the past is willing to help him now br br as far as i know no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one hollywood films rarely persecute the black population but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles if you're an african american actor you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy the maid the servant or the porter because that's the only way you'll work in intruder in the dust there is to be found one of the most memorable non porter roles a black actor ever had lucas and as i described above is no stereotypical character and might have been hard for audiences to accept even today black characters are usually simple magical and kind the recent arthouse hit far from heaven is a great example of that is kind of a jerk and he's very stubborn although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel he's not any kind of stereotype he's a complex human being hernandez plays extraordinarily well i haven't seen the film in a while but he also appears in robert 1955 film kiss me deadly as well as the cinematic adaptation of final novel the br br all the actors are great in the film i should also praise quickly claude jarman jr who has the great role of chick the novel takes place from his point of view and he is the conventional hero of the picture jarman is quite an actor he captures the character who also appears elsewhere in fiction narrating for example events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel the town perfectly he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film rio grande the only other film of clarence brown's that i've seen is national velvet quite a different picture than intruder in the dust his job here is exceptional i really have to credit him with capturing faulkner perfectly other famous faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic the long hot summer filmed in 1958 which i really like despite that or too cold tomorrow filmed in 1972 which i do not like that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of faulkner the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas sirk's great 1958 filming of pylon really a different sort of faulkner novel altogether tarnished angels 10 10
<START> i admit i was taken in by the provocative stills of charlotte lewis from this film as well as a comment on the imdb message board devoted to her calling this picture a great underrated film and so i got with great difficulty my own copy of dial help br br what a waste br br nothing but a cheaply made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which i'm not even going to repeat with several telegraphed sequences for instance when we see lewis lovingly feeding her fish we know right away what's going to happen to them later not even lewis with her beautiful raven hair large and luminous brown eyes full and pouty lips and stunning figure can save this film lewis fans would be better off with bare essentials sketch artist or even golden child
<START> for a squadron leader normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot no matter how close a friend he is in the face of oncoming enemy troops is hard to believe especially when they both have to share a cramped spitfire cockpit two into a ok but a spit come on this part of the film is a adventure not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously as said by s eriksson gothenburg sweden is rubbish not at all one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots who planned and flew illegally a strafing mission over france one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire while german infantry was moving in on them and flew them both out of there in a spit they were both severely injured in former fights one had an artificial leg from the knee down now that may sound like something out of but it happened ill get sources if needed
<START> first of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize it is actually a very complex story unlike bergman's other movies that are more bend towards character study in we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why everything is open for any resolution this creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful as the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters that are turned into symbols of humanity both its dark and luminous sides we have the example of the innocent bystanders who try to get by during an absurd war the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of an atrocious event character the innocent dead children the nameless figures almost turned into animals from the boat etc all of them are somehow seen through the eyes of jan von sydow and eva their characters are more restrained then in other films en passion and this is exactly because what is important here is the story the way exterior events have the capacity to radically change human nature br br bergman made this film two years after persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by liv character is nothing that's it the meaning of art and the meaning of life the latter being nothing more than a play that includes all plays but what about war and especially the ones of the century in persona the only real emotion suffered by character is when she sees a victim of the vietnam war turned into a human torch in that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war in a nameless region of a nameless country we only assume it's two factions speaking the same language fight an absurd war jan and eva are two dreamers caught in the middle but their dreams are woven in a sort of counterpoint jan is at first an idealist unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will towards the end he turns into a radically different personality capable of unmotivated murder strong willed pitiless watch carefully the suicidal on the boat the simplicity of the act is harrowing on the other hand eva progressively looses touch with reality and at the end she is completely suffused in her own unfulfilled dream br br from a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way bergman places the viewer alongside the character putting the camera in the car with the actors or in an extreme close up behind the actor nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera there are some masterful hand held effects very good in making everything seem real the shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary like the screenplay is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that matter actually the whole movie is paradoxical it has an intensity in the subject that is in a sharp contrast to the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed nothing is melodramatic here there is no compassion no hope and no apparent redemption but as in liv dream at the end it is all so beautiful one cannot help but being amazed at it it was not so awful since it was so beautiful
<START> it's painfully obvious that the people who made this movie have never seen such brilliant spoofs as the naked gun and hot shots this movie is terrible and so are the actors they wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face as i felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish br br the movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever i'm sure that i could make a better movie with my friends to me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much not a single clever or funny line no trace of intelligence behind it it's a pathetic movie and i'd like to meet the person who actually likes this movie yuck
<START> i really thoroughly enjoyed this movie for one it didn't have the corny special effects that the big budget movies have the acting was decent in this one only you can tell right off the bat that it's dubbed but once you get over that fact and that you can't switch languages on the dvd version it's cool the plot line was very unique you take a situation like a heat wave very common around the world especially in frankfurt which i've been to many times and you take a garbage strike which happens often enough in this country and you have a recipe for disaster i loved how the hordes of rats just went everywhere and how the idea that if you picked up the garbage that's the last thing you wanna do you pick it up the rats don't get what the want they are in essence following the garbage pick up so you ask well if garbage men are on strike who picks up the garbage private contractors anyway military wants to quarantine off the city oops wrong thing to do then you would have all the rats take over the city then throw in a mayor who wants to keep a lid on the budget and line her pockets you have a realistic movie and the female lead is also a pleasure to watch on the screen a very decent movie i thought wish more were made like this another small nitpick is the depiction of frankfurt could have been done a little better but for the average viewer who's never been to frankfurt i was born in germany and been to frankfurt many times it won't matter but all in all a great big thumbs up
<START> spoilers ahead br br 15 park avenue my humble take on this film br br now for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine niche films like 15 park avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities with this thought and a mild sense of embarrassment that i hadn't watched the complete film earlier i watched this film last saturday there are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary mulholland drive david lynch from which this film borrows at least 3 concepts br br a that at least some truths are relative b the first scene of shabana and going around in a car as the opening credits roll is uncannily similar to the car ride that betty and rita undertook in mulholland drive in both cases the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in film c the incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole behind involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per se is seamlessly linked to other works of lynch notice carefully the disheveled long hair the effect of the beggar woman in 15 pa appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message br br the other films from which 15 pa also borrows is blow up especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth vs perceived truth poser presented towards the end of antonioni's masterpiece of course the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind a beautiful mind although admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and shabana who professes it inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of character through those very prophecies in an outstanding scene in the movie some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of shabana where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe to the artificial of the 'make believe' world of but for all their differences the sisters are alike too both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships one out of choice and the other out of nature so pain at being rejected in love by is in harmony with the inability of to form a special bond with either kunal or sanjeev but i'm getting ahead of myself viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways br br hypothesis 1 it was shabana all along there is a certain section of the audience who think so but that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too i e all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing along with her br br hypothesis 2 there was a real and the ending is a metaphor this pov says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film when in response to a statement by joy rahul that is looking for something that she will never find his wife shefali shah philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment br br there are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like br br hypothesis 3 shabana and konkona are alter egos of the same person hypothesis 4 shabana too is a figment of imagination hypothesis 5 the old haggard perhaps mad beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story br br are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested well your guess is as good as mine br br why 15 park avenue contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the park avenue in ny i believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap remember her stating jo jo's profession as prime minister of which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing the prefix is used as it was on 15th december that got engaged to and after his she remains forever in a time warp the film has its fair share of flaws lack of use of a strong background score which in films like these can really augment the narrative some sloppy dialogs by some forced dialog delivery inconsistent performances shabana and are excellent though imo by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted shefali sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot i give it 7 10 as it made me think but not any higher than that because i can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed those previously i have already thought on similar lines earlier so the experience post 15 pa is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty where am i coming from i gave 9 5 10 to though rumors still persist that one ray ghost directed it 7 5 to ek 7 to 'mr and mrs and 5 to on an existential level it failed to invoke my interest not even as much as say a show'
<START> this was painful i made myself watch it until the end even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot if there was one my patience was not rewarded the ending was even worse than the rest of the film chucky walks into the hospital with a priest and his concubine says i do how vile can one movie be
<START> clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting br br the make up done by bob keen and geoffrey was fantastic it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground it was really a treat to see the quality of work br br it wasn't particularly horrible as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer br br i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also nothing spectacular but fair this was only anne bobby's third film and she was good also br br the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts as did david cronenberg ha
<START> this groundbreaking film is truly a work of art i went into the screening at the convention in indiana with very low expectations having already viewed 2 other film with gamer in the title both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one i had plucked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip i found between the seat cushions but from the opening credits dorkness had me the northwest setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master lodge powerfully portrayed by nathan rice and his misfit band of friends who set aside the real life dramas they face everyday to face fantastical dramas in the setting lodge provides for them after the first scene set in the fantasy world they inhabit they are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape this drew so many comparisons to my own life that i was moved to tears rice's acting is of such amazing caliber that i truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty something male suffering from frustration male pattern baldness and an annoying group of friends that can't seem to grasp concepts like right and wrong friends are of some note here leo the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job aside from lodge yet he seems to gravitate socially towards gary the youngest of the group this seems only slightly odd at first until you realize that gary is in fact a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his fantasy world this dichotomy serves not to confuse but to inform and uplift the audience about the importance of diversity in our society my only complaint about this is that the actors who portray leo scott c brown and gary christian doyle seem to play the characters for laughs at times as though they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a hard hitting action drama speaking of action brian lewis makes his film debut as cass the third and most influential member of motley crew the tension is always high when he is on screen both when he is arguing passionately about his beliefs to lodge or when displaying his fantastic martial arts skills as silence his fantasy character or even when he turns around suddenly to face the audience and you duck in the audience so as not to get smacked by his fantastic chin lewis lights up the screen no matter what he's doing and i hope to see more of him in the future once the action begins in this movie it just doesn't quit the drama and the action blend so seamlessly at times that you tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment truly a thrill ride of epic proportions i would recommend the gamers dorkness rising as required viewing for anyone who loves film it was almost worth losing an eye over br br chip
