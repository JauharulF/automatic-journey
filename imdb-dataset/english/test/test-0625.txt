<START> when i was young i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police and i think its great leslie awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways it's one goofy show br br one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits i think my favorite one is when not o j walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame classic br br the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when shows a cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes i know i think they used it too many times by whatever br br good acting good gags great show br br 7 10
<START> as roger corman has said in an interview low budget film making enables film makers to take chances on offbeat ideas well you'd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barry's death bed the bed that eats br br the film does have a back story to it and it's an interesting one at that i'll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid br br death bed is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously it's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick it in exploitative ingredients there's some tasty dollops of female nudity and yet is also art albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility br br the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie quality the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although patrick spence thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand future 'boy meets world' father william russ br br this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film even if the exposure took years to take hold br br if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items death bed may be just what you've got in mind br br 7 10
<START> everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime you watch it take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour but this is not one of those it's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while br br i would like to see someone to take responsibility for dante he's really the most stupid villain you can think of a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50's dracula how can someone came up with this guy and the hero the dragon or whatever my cereals box has better acting skills than him maybe than all of them it's unbelievable but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it they're so lame it's beyond any kind of description there's no shame i just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any studio but i'm just thrilled it was watching this is a self mutilating pleasure see this only if you're in a movie quest for pain and in that case this one is a sure winner
<START> a fun filled romp full of silly if not sometimes cruel jokes not the best of movies but definitely well worth watching david niven and stewart granger are their usual charming selves with granger as an especially delightful and ingenious gentleman ava gardner as wonderful as always with such a delightful character that is absolutely the story line is typical but full of surprises especially concerning the unconventional relationships between granger gardner and niven
<START> this was a great movie it had one sot so nice outburst plus there were some very intense drama scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers under 6 br br for a under the radar film the acting was quite enjoyable and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end br br this movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day but was given a somewhat more believable scenario the dream scenes were a distraction at first but did a great deal to establish the plot the pranks and hi jinx were also quite amusing br br we hope you like as much as we did
<START> much like brass caligula the people who made this movie can't tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism no build up at all just throw naked women on the screen no it doesn't work that way if close ups of female genitalia aren't your thing prepare to be looking away from the screen at many points i often did the all women are whores at heart mentality of the movie is offensive and the story is by turns absurd and boring the escape is the most boring part but halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nowhere and involves one of the female prisoners and one of the male guards in a nude wrestling match which she wins with a couple of judo moves although the choreography of the fight is bad the whole scene is undeniably memorable in fact that scene and the nice cinematography are the only two reasons i give this film out of 4 instead of 0
<START> what a surprise this film was i've seen a good few of fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director he also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed complex story line the dubbing on this is not good but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like baby' br br the photography in this film is fantastic a strange almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered a scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence br br what went wrong lucio perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film and it slowly went downhill after that
<START> i viewed this movie at the magnolia theater in dallas a couple of days ago punk everyone and everything involved in the movie added to the of it the music well of course but the movie itself captured the whole punk genre even a grandmother and school teacher me can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality well reality film wise this movie takes a handful of ticked off young film makers and clearly and cleverly shows the why of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the waldo film the relatively happy girl gave good comic relief a nice respite from the continual but understandable ragging on the dude who left them in a lurch gotta love stu though and be sure to watch read the credits they're the icing on the cake
<START> i am a maharashtrian a teenager living in the 21st century and its obvious that i'm not much into even bollywood let alone marathi movies yet when i watched it left me with a unique feeling one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of generating br br it is a fact that like most indian movies the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its marathi dialogues which however hard one tries can not be effectively translated into english br br explores in intricate detail the relationship between a grandparent and a child and it does complete justice to this strong bond dialogues like pan ek my is also one in a million enhance the emotion anyone who has closely observed the grandparent child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the movie br br overall it definitely worth watching its a movie that has left a profound effect on me i will surely recommend it to anyone
<START> like night stalker and then x files the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out unlike these the hero es weren't left holding an empty bag at the end they had usually tangible results it was also made clear that the 'good guys' were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things imagination wit acting which didn't always take itself too seriously i miss it one reason being i'm hard pressed to think of too many shows aside which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet for all that still made sense too i agree with another reviewer that the character was somewhat underused but when she was on screen it wasn't just for eye candy she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it a rarity in those days sullivan if he wasn't in the department he'd be working for the kgb or cia he's that sort of coldly efficient ruthless type he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done king it's clearly a game to him one he excels at and which he into ideas for the detective spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real' job he's probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too i do agree that the eventual spin off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original however
<START> i've been a fan of larry king's show for awhile i think he does a terrific job overall and i don't think he ever out as so many people seem to believe he's a subtle scorpio he gets his in when he needs to just as he managed to do last night with paris hilton during her first post jail tv interview br br the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge gave her what she believes was a too harsh sentence and what's more actually made her serve it in all the time she was in jail supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell she never once in her mind rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge saw fit to impose on her she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she 1 showed up late in court for the original hearing and 2 proceeded to inform him when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended did she not get the papers in the mail that i have people who read that sort of thing for me br br all the time she was in her cell she never came to the realization that this action showing up late and that statement and more importantly the attitude the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed just might have made judge pardon the pun go sour on her br br last night on king's show after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience how she has learned her lesson she answered his question do you think you got a raw deal with a resounding yes and during the course of the conversation if you can call it that she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her king asked gently more than once if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she finds herself in to which she pretty much stared at him blankly she basically therefore holds the conscious belief that she's been victimized in this situation she does not understand how she herself caused it that day in court by her cavalier attitude with the judge i feel this is very sad tragic even considering what a huge role model hilton is to some people and it renders anything she said last night about her so called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness contradiction and hypocrisy br br during the course of the interview hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible at the end of the interview king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was she responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes completely superficial non insights which she had read on air as if she were nelson or something and finally grunting out i don't have a favorite passage br br judge in my book is a hero and after last night so is larry king for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is
<START> i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of nora roberts' story not having read the book i don't know if this adaptation was faithful but i do know it wasn't good actually the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to nora roberts br br i planned ahead and watched carolina moon because of claire forlani i've never been sure if she's a good actress she's been decent in some movies average in others and really bad in this one but forlani wasn't alone the performances were all over the place oliver hudson was wooden and boring josie davis was hammy then amidst all this b rate acting there's jacqueline bisset she didn't have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but even sleepwalking through that she was miles ahead of the others br br still forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and i was not disappointed in that capacity here i believe forlani can be more than eye candy but until she turns in a good performance in a good movie she continues to excel at that and i'll continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in fandom is fun that way br br this movie though carolina moon was pretty bad in addition to the bad acting fake southern accents are really distracting the direction was pedestrian it wasn't horrible it was just the boring made for tv caliber you're used to seeing on lifetime br br if you're a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy carolina moon for that reason as i did if you're a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen albeit in a lackluster form otherwise this movie is unremarkable
<START> i just finished watching dog watch i thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities the acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad but as the saying goes the devil was in the details br br some examples br br 1 the bleed through on charlie sam elliott bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding br br 2 would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well lighted area this seemed very silly to me br br i am not unusually picky about a movie but in my humble opinion this one is definitely not recommended by me
<START> after watching this movie i felt as if i had just eaten a box of stale chewy cracker jack only to find no prize inside this movie has real promise porn stars in a skinemax feature unfortunately someone forgot to tell the producers that we like some t a in our t a flicks sure we get a few quick flashes and a couple of bathing in the creek scenes but where's the sex how can you have four girls sorority girls no less in this type of movie with only one pitiful 5 second lesbian scene good night usa up all night provides more titillation look we don't watch this type of movie for great cinematography screenwriting or action we want to see some kink what a letdown
<START> honestly i don't know why this show lasted as long as it did ah well humor is subjective eh but yeah this show is incredibly unfunny if you ask me tim allen is annoying jill is annoying the boys are annoying al is annoying the neighbor is annoying it's just more annoying then funny the plots are all the same tim makes jill mad and has to make things right again and the latter seasons less said about them the better who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom yeah great idea jerks so yeah home improvement isn't a very good sitcom i'd recommend you go watch news radio or seinfeld if i had to give this show a rating i'd give it a 1 10 seeing as it never made me laugh once ever so yeah it's still better then the nanny though
