<START> ladies and gentlemen the show begins with this documentary film it's structured in three chapters each one chronologically arranged the first presents the classical physics and links to einstein the second studies in depth the quantum physics and enters in string theory the last reveals the everything theory the difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way with daily objects although you must believe them without checking by yourself if you are not a scientist and even if you are a scientist the film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique or the way it's produced what really imports is the story and what a story
<START> the whole set up of this contrived disney family film ad exec gets his teenage daughter a horse because she wants one more than anything else in the world is just an excuse to film the big climactic horse show at the end all the other ingredients the ad campaign for the stomach pill kurt russell as a potential boyfriend for the youngster lloyd bochner as a potential rival for dean jones over the affections of diane baker are shelved near the end simply to showcase the horse over half the picture is padding and worse it is whiny and obnoxious the kid is the sort who cries on the couch with a dog in her arms and as usual she gets her way from
<START> alice a new york doctor gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an drug resulting in the patient's death without a job alice is forced to go to where she tends to the brother of a wealthy white landowner the brother thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in the local people's voodoo practices and rituals ritual is a mediocre horror flick the action is pretty dull the plot twists are silly and there is no suspense there is a bit of gore as someone is killing off white people with a machete but not too much the cinematography is decent however the acting is truly woeful definitely one to avoid 4 out of 10
<START> don t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of the time machine is based on an earlier film it s not because this is a pointless re film that is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the remake of the get away from a few years ago the scenes are identical to the original the dialogue is identical to the original the camera angles are identical no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script but with a director like van sant at the helm we should be thankful he sure t no hitchcock in fact i might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a pork pie hat didn t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s br br bottom line avoid
<START> i just love this film it totally rocks nicolas cage looks hot and tommy does not i definitely feel that fred and randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they're totally cool my favorite part is when he says peter piper picked a pepper i guess i did
<START> 2 37 succeeds admirably at showing us what australian teenagers feel and don't say these are the stories of real kids and i think we would be naive to think otherwise the only new thing 2 37 really brings us is an australian point of view we often watch troubled american children but often fail to link the same problems to our own teens executed with clever and artful cinematography i did however upon immediate recognition of the disappointing final song find the musical direction lacking in sophistication i applaud the fabulous casting of this film these are regular looking aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this great performances all round and you can't top gary sweet this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and unless you're squeamish or you like to leave with warm and fuzzies go and see 2 37
<START> i saw five fingers at the drive in in what 1973 it was the the first kung fu movie i'd ever seen and i was greatly entertained i recently bought it on dvd and watched it again i was greatly entertained the second time too i believe this is probably the one most kung fu movies are modeled after rival schools different styles revenge white hat good guys and black hat bad guys they even threw in the japanese very bad guys styles of karate and judo i remember being amused by the dubbing dialog along the lines of hey you you are a very bad guy and they should not get away with this i will have a go at this bad crowd this time it wasn't so distracting i guess i'm used to it if you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre this is one you should see
<START> way back in 1996 one of the airliner pilots where i used to work gave me a copy of this film he told me that it'll make me cry i never believed him and we even made bets after seeing the film i cried a bucket even after the seeing the film i found myself in the bathroom crying it was actually the most touching film i have ever seen i like the part where dexter's mom confronted eric's mother the line went something like your sons' best friend just died today and it's not gonna be easy if you ever lay your hands on him again i will kill you the last part where dexter took eric's shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today honestly just thinking about it makes my eyes teary a story of what true friendship is all about my girlfriend loved it too she hated me for letting her see the film i cried a bucket she cried a river
<START> i'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize u s wars in afghanistan and particularly iraq by suggesting that the u s does war well but doesn't clean up afterward thus the seeds for future trouble furthermore they do this without making the enemy and without making republicans the enemy since it's the republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing bringing down the ussr by covertly supplying a war in afghanistan br br but seriously now do we really want a movie that repeatedly says let's go kill some russians like that's the greatest thing a red blooded american can do and are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes even his supposedly smart assistant who is always dressed professionally keeps looking at charlie like he's just the most wonderful handsomest greatest guy around as if she's nancy reagan to his ronnie julia roberts does a bang up job in her role but basically women are really demeaned in this movie and it was really annoying
<START> i first encountered arthur penn's four friends late one night on hbo having never heard of it i expected very little but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of penn and screenwriter steve would be like for the next two hours or so i sat mesmerized watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove a semi autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s four friends follows the story of an eastern european immigrant the brilliant craig wasson from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape accompanying on his journey are his friends georgia the radiant jodi in a role that sadly she has never had the opportunity to equal tom jim metzler and david michael four friends covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here but if you haven't seen this film i urge you to find a copy it's just been released on dvd and watch it you won't be disappointed script is wonderfully poignant Â at times funny at times incredibly sad but always fascinating and honest penn directs with a sure hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following the cast is uniformly superb this film should have made a major star out of wasson who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents jodi not your standard brainless hollywood sexpot heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film metzler and subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co stars but they are excellent and help anchor the film also superb are miklos simon and elizabeth lawrence as parents as well as reed birney and lois smith i have not been without a copy of four friends since the day after i first saw it on hbo those many years ago it has been and remains one of my all time favorite films for more than 20 years now i can't recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance you'll feel the same way
<START> a dangerous psychopathic killer jacob goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting blackwell hotel alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded jacob four years ago when one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives see no evil was directed by the porno filmmaker gregory dark and it stars wwe superstar kane as remorseless psychopath the supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy overall i liked this film and you should too if you are into mindless slasher flicks sure it's clichÃ© but who cares 7 out of 10
<START> one of my favorite villains the evil princess is just the perfect villain for this movie full of space travel horses diamonds mystical characters colorful backgrounds evil characters etc etc very bright full of action you will not get bored great movie
<START> when i saw lon chaney jr and boris karloff in the cast i was expecting to find a typically schlocky 1950's style horror movie the opening scene a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background seemed to confirm this once i began watching it though what i discovered was a nifty little mystery about an englishman richard green seeking to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the black forest and if necessary to take revenge against the evil count stephen mcnally who ruled the territory chaney as the voiceless had a rather limited role one which reminded me of the hunchback of notre dame actually while karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as dr in fact was one of the more interesting characters in the movie and it was difficult to know until the very end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy the castle set was magnificent and even the limited depiction of the black forest was real enough it certainly didn't come across as low budget compared to other movies i've seen anyway the only disappointment i thought was rita performance as the countess she seemed somewhat dry and didn't seem to put much passion into the role br br that aside i found that this movie held my attention throughout and there was enough suspense about how this was all going to turn out to make it well worth the watching definitely recommended with a 7 10 rating
<START> although i rarely agree with i have to say that this film while not awful just didn't make me care at all and it all just seemed to be out of place it had its moments three or four ones that made me snicker but most of the time i was just sitting and wondering why why did the characters do this even hot shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out br br if you want to see a nice film then watch there it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the swedish tundra br br i am so disappointed
<START> of course i have disappeared into the movies the neil young concert film 'heart of gold ' br br there have been many great concert films through the years the best being martin scorsese's 'the last which filmed the band's last concert at west a phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two you could change the world as you can guess i felt all five to the bottom of my twenty four year old soul br br neil young was in 'the last waltz ' they had to digitally before digital actually they had to manually scrape a big hanging cocaine rock that from his nose so in the film there's a bright light that is not the star of bethlehem dangling above his lip and below his nostril it's a famous bit of rock and roll history br br but 'the last was made when the band and neil and everyone else was in their thirties and 'heart of gold' was filmed last year when neil is in his sixties and his band looks as if they are in their late nineties and the entire movie could visually be used by the christian right and the dea in the same way that those ohio state patrol films of the perils of drunk driving were used when i was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging through front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch br br close your eyes and it is a terrific concert open them and view dorian grey's hidden portrait case in point the once ethereally beautiful harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with neil and from dark to light appearing to be a ring wraith leapt full borne out of the river in front of ghastly ghostlike a nose that doesn't appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery eyes that make buttons on dolls look lifelike and the ability to express any emotion human or not constrained by unrestrained over indulgence in botox my mind reeled porcupine peru jack daniels living hard for decades my god sweet harris who i saw sing for free at fred's in boulder a face a 2000 year dead pharoah would not accept but the voice as pure as a thick lipped bottle of boulder beer from the waters of boulder creek and i closed my eyes and smelled an homage one must use homage at least once in any film review to fred's hamburgers on boulder mall and the steve martin pink panther movie br br it would have been a terrific concert sitting in the dark in auditorium maybe twenty rows back but close up in close ups it was a medieval morality play depicting the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life br br the concert theme emblazoned on the scenery a prairie wind the last song guitars i counted eight and i wondered if irony was at play i don't think so a native american bass player a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like buffalo bill a piano player whose face looked like the face in the scream the chick singers actually matronly singers mostly reminding one of the lost youth of senior united flight attendants still plying the friendly skies dressed in matching full length distressed denim dresses no it was played straight br br none of them had seen i would bet a mighty wind br br it will be a great cd and would be glad to tell tales of hippy dippy boulder when neil was a long haired canadian crooner whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to mirror heartache and loss feelings as universal then as now br br but only in a dark bar
