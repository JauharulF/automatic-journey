<START> i had never heard of dead man's bounty when i saw it at the dvd store a few weeks ago and i thought i had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had val kilmer in it in a truly unique role sadly it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that i realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions the first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long it's unbelievable how bad it is and sadly it doesn't get any better br br val kilmer is featured prominently on the movie's cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half wit crooks and the most inept of a unique town sheriff that i've ever seen in a movie he's played by linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the american old west br br does poland have this type of frontier past i don't know my knowledge of polish history is not my strong point but i can tell you this the sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that i can ever remember seeing in a movie he is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose what the hell is this crap i am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie br br throughout the movie the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling the you see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie br br it takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road my understanding is that it is a part of poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the american southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come from br br i have heard that val kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages br br yeah whatever br br seems to me that was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role personally i would really feel that i had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while i like to think that he didn't even read the script for this mess because if he did i am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role br br at any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by kilmer seeking the reward soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters br br there is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of american rituals in one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into kilmer's eyes for what reason i can't imagine and then later a man makes a short speech over kilmer's corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel what the hell br br not convinced yet here are some more reasons not to watch it in one scene the sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick a man gets a head wound that his head and body in blood in a daze he it with gunpowder smart near the end the sheriff appears to have a broken arm sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink also smart br br why doesn't he just use his good arm i have no idea that like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title summer love are you kidding me avoid this mess at all costs br br in the meantime here's something for the imdb goofs page Â br br errors made by characters possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers this movie got made ha
<START> loki norse god of mischief creates a mask that endows the with cartoon like powers at the command of his father odin he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind in the meantime the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask etc etc if this sounds like a pretty thin plot line it is add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish and the result is very very bad you can find worse movies but you'll have to actively search for them br br for the most part son of the mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre schooler but in light of scenes such as the mask baby urinating copiously in six different directions including on his father this premise seems unlikely i asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie and he responded convicted felons apparently forgetting for the moment that the constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment br br but just making a bad movie is not a sin or hell would be overflowing what makes it a sin is that 72 million was spent on this piece of garbage to put things in perspective the day after we watched son of the mask my son and i watched good night and good luck a movie that garnered six academy award nominations including best picture and was brought in for 7 million that's right just one tenth of the amount of money spent on son of the mask this then is the sin to flush good money down the sewer when it could have been better used in making watchable movies or feeding starving children or for that matter almost any other purpose the producers should truly be ashamed of themselves
<START> barbara stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend christmas with a popular magazine writer's family at her farm in connecticut the problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her column and she can't even cook her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend uncle felix owner of a hungarian restaurant in new york city br br things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for christmas a scheme is hastily planned with her stuffy fiancÃ© providing an actual connecticut farm neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking but when the handsome young sailor arrives on christmas eve romantic complications ensue as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy navy man and vice versa br br this is a charming warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for barbara stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent aided by such marvelous character actors as sydney greenstreet una o'connor s z and many others a christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough bitchy women in femme fatale roles truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time
<START> movies aren't always suppose to be about deep thoughts sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality out to sea fits the bill perfectly br br a light hearted golden years romantic comedy out to sea may not be big budget you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen but it's still very much a movie worth watching a sweet movie that needs to be given a break br br this is just good light hearted fun it's not meant to be a deep movie it's something worth watching if for nothing else you must see it for brent humorously stiff and uptight rendition of como va gil is a character you love to hate and mr spiner pulls off the perfect evil comic foil to two beloved comedy movie gods
<START> this is another of hollywood's anti communist polemics of the golden 1950s stalwart american gene barry lovely englishwoman valerie french and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given containing fantastic and fantastically vague power what will the earthlings do with such power toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind anybody who knows american cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do but the story gets ripe when the americans actually test the things in the middle of the pacific then one scientist alone with the ultimate power in the universe comes up with his own theory and uses it his smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling br br here's the spoiler for this dog the capsules inside the have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only confirmed enemies of freedom that's right don't worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom just do it hurray no commies silly female and you threw yours into the sea ha ha kiss me baby
<START> some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens you are alone is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain death is explored figuratively and literally it is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive too awake to reality it is the life not which you imagined behind the eyes of passer this film explores the aching pain in us all the frown beneath the cheery facade the ache below the ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all the writer is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand he as director focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation this is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together i have encountered as of yet even though the two characters encounter is probably not the normal encounter br br the soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough it is each characters real voice sung through the beauty pain talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market the perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it br br i always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with mr both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it
<START> there were some decent moments in this film and a couple of times where it was pretty funny however this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by there was better chemistry between him and liv tyler in armageddon hell there was better chemistry between sly and sandra in demolition man br br there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving br br this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding wait until it's been out for a year and a half on video and rent it in the 49 cent bin if you've got nothing else to do on a rainy sunday afternoon and you can't think of any better movies to rent
<START> the kind of b movies from the 1950's that were schlocky yet so much fun are to what predator island pays homage filmed in connecticut predator island is set on an island called with a lighthouse hell's beacon which is inhabited by only the couple who tends the lighthouse in typical 1950's sci fi fashion after a half dozen young adults crash their boat into the island's rocky shore hideous creatures from outer space invade the island after a meteor hits nearby the creatures start both inhabiting the bodies of their victims as well as devouring them lots of cursing and lame comebacks are the primary form of dialogue in this movie it is so hokey that you just have to laugh at times if you are looking for a movie that is stupid but in a fun way then this one fits the bill br br interesting note i appear in the film as a dead body in the far background of the final scene during filming they needed about 50 extras yet around 300 people showed up for the opportunity they eventually used nearly 200 of them
<START> leonard and frances de la tour carry this film not without a struggle as the script was obviously hurriedly cobbled together out of old episodes when it came out this must have been a real disappointment as it's also done on a bus ticket budget attempts to move it out of the house which is jarringly unrecognisable a bad job all round there with a picnic fantasy sequences rugby and a boxing match in the local gym simply don't work most of these are just character light setups for a solitary not particularly good gag that said the interplay of and de la tour and anybody else with him is mostly hilarious they even manage to make a soda gag work but you can see the struggle with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes plot half way through don has very little to do except 'be black' and due to the random script hacks christopher changes character at least twice and in the end as he often did in the tv series though you might not remember read the scripts eric lets you down with a up' ending were they that cynical or just too desperate to be in the film business and de la tour are always funny but as a film it's a terrible postscript to a fondly remembered tv series rip
<START> this is one cheap looking movie a stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her she goes to the police who also rape her she finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'the zombie the fact that stephanie beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film
<START> what can i say this was one awful movie to watch i am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general due to the fact that most are usually low budget but this really pushed me up the wall i mean is this was has happened to gay cinema haven't gay producers and directors learned anything from gus van saints and ang lee's films just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted i kept on praying for moments where i would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters but that never happened most of the characters performances were just not very convincing it was like watching one of those badly produced made for tv movie specials on a local access tv stations i cannot tell u how greatly disappointed it was seeing this film after being a big fan of tori other works and the directors last work on latter day saints it was definitely not worth the wait definitely a few hours of my life i will never get back and will certainly not be purchasing it on dvd
<START> this movie was quite a mess there wasn't anything really going for it the only character that had any appeal was bobbie phillips' maya and she wasn't even worth it br br the plot is standard double cross the double crossing double with a few too many double crosses to make any sense sometimes that means it keeps you guessing in this case it keeps you waiting by the end i just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot
<START> this is one of the greatest documentaries i've ever seen along with dark days i have skated for maybe an hour my entire life and i still love this movie peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly helped in part with some incredible archival footage tony is one of the coolest individuals in existence love those knee high striped sport socks you rock tony br br not only is this movie a visual feast but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history if you're into 70's rock buy the dvd you won't regret it
<START> the positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends this film is amateurish in terms of direction acting in fact in every aspect if the imdb are gonna allow filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films then that is a very sad thing this film has a marketable premise but it is absolutely horrifically made br br film is subjective so everyone has their own opinion but this film is on a par with the work of ed wood but without any of the charm to think otherwise shows bad taste of the highest order br br this is not a personal thing i don't know anyone associated with the film i'm just a film lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore i felt the need to address the balance and give a more accurate view of the film it's very poorly made and the direction is below even film making by the numbers the acting is the worse ever committed to film the best thing about this film is the poster and dvd cover art beyond that it's not worth the time
<START> i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing the evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball i started fast forwarding to see how it ended and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it the main character played by ellen barkin just wasn't believable at all peta wilson acted very well in this film but her character was way out there and there wasn't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work
