<START> all i could think while watching this movie was will it ever end it was unbearably boring to watch i was wishing i could just turn it off but i wanted to do this review justice so i fought the good fight and withstood the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you the good reader need not bear that pain also br br this movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper however the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all br br the opening scene features a mineshaft in the early 1900's where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the tunnels that aren't big enough for the adults to fit into this seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie but after 4 minutes it becomes clear that is not the case the adults who committed these crimes are never punished there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions the opening scene is way better than and completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie the last time an opening scene misrepresented a movie so grievously was the opening scene of 28 days later which was the only good scene in that whole movie wicked little things zombies a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it's crappiness and sell it again is exactly the same in this regard the opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie br br instead the movie flashes forward to present day a single mother and her two bratty foul mouthed kids right here is when it would have been wise to press the stop button and never go near the movie again br br in the first hour the zombie kids are barely even seen they get maybe 3 minutes of screen time total all they do is kill a pig that's it the rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store wander around the forest and have inane conversations with each other the dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them br br there would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie every single character is both dumb annoying with no redeeming qualities at all not to mention one dimensional and clichÃ©d br br this movie would have been vastly improved if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids as they were driving up to their new house then the end credits rolled that right there would instantly change the score from 1 10 to 10 10 honestly when the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road her daughter scolds her you almost killed us mom of course anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian it would be the pedestrian who would be dead not the people safely encased inside the car i guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds and runs in the family br br wicked little things zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge it's not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like if you ever wanna get in my pants again you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now seriously that's verbatim from the movie the teenagers are so clichÃ©d one dimensional badly acted dumb annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie it feels like a cause for celebration of course the princess dumb weed smoking foul mouthed beer drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott free what a buzzkill that was she was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them and most deserving of a to the head all the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes as aforementioned to still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though is totally inexcusable br br the reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes so by keeping her alive long past when she should be they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods by 1 hour and 22 minutes in it's the second time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won't start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her br br the zombie kids are completely generic never say anything no character development at all for any of them br br in the end all 3 of the annoying idiotic main characters live which in my opinion is the filmmakers' way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience in my opinion the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes die br br avoid wicked little things zombies like the bubonic plague
<START> if one overlooks the technical problems of this early 1930 sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of john wayne one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since beginning at the missouri a large caravan of wagons people and animals head west the wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons indians meet with wayne and allow the train to pass through their land later indians gather west of the train to combat them the wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle and fire their rifles creating with the circling indians a veil of smoke br br when the battle ends the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart this scene is remarkable as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart it is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living the wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential and mud everywhere they finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in oregon the film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2 0 1 ratio in 1930 br br i haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie given the technical limitations of the sound the music is at times moving such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end br br while all the critics rave about the searchers and wayne's psychology racism short temper and complex characters the big trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships one of the best westerns i have seen
<START> now i am going to do this without putting spoilers if i can my cousin and i were renting movies the other weekend and we stumbled across this with the big freaking' scarecrow on the cover it looked cool so we rented it alongside kungfu hustle br br wow just wow br br to start off the movie was horrible now the box art opening scenes and music was decent to well done but the movie itself is horrendous the acting is sub par sean the lead shows hardly any emotion and or effort in his character the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover false advertising perhaps and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling event br br and trust me i'm a wrestling fan i know bad camera angles and honestly this is right up there with gigli and tang it's done so bad that it amuses me it makes me laugh so somehow this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me br br but to be fair it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies especially of the slasher genre i recommend that people do watch this just to get a good grasp of what to avoid
<START> like one of the other reviewers might have been amazon i was first introduced to tourist trap by the beloved decrepit old 9 in ny around january 1983 devil dog the hound of hell which i'd been waiting to see since it debuted on halloween 1978 had just ended and i thought i'd had my horror fill for the day quit laughing that three eyed sp monster ike eisenmann draws up in his room is scary br br for as much as i still enjoy richard crenna wearing his made for tv horror hat it was the first 10 minutes of tourist trap following devil dog that day that really left a mark and months later it ended up being the first movie i ever taped off tv used to play this fairly frequently often as the saturday afternoon million dollar movie as others have observed it's one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front a veritable left hook and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast dances and jabs putting the opening scene a larger context along the way then moves on to the real climax see night of the living dead re animator br br two paragraphs and i haven't mentioned a single mannequin face it the damn things are scary enough without the music and the script i too can remember some scary dress dummies and the like in various relatives' and basements and say what you like about how relatively straightforward schmoeller and carroll's approach is no one before or since has played it this well in real life a good mannequin will make you do a double take and here that's about the last thing you're likely to see if you happen to be stuck at defunct wax museum and roadside stand yes there is a point i loved her very much where chuck connors is trying to pass for vincent price yes the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages i can't see the script being all that thick it doesn't matter from direction to competent acting meryl streep's emphatically not in attendance and here that helps instead of hinders to another useful and effective pino score see carrie and various other de palma movies to various lighting film stock use of varying sound levels i could go on every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its parts br br did i mention it's scary as hell stephen king talked this movie up in danse macabre a year or so after its release and with good reason like much of his work it may not be great art but it sure does tell a scary story and does it well the rest of the cast may be relatively unknown wasn't jocelyn jones in that texas car chase movie as well but chuck connors and tanya roberts were and are just familiar enough to audiences to make you think stephen king style that this could happen to you or people you know br br comparisons to psycho plot and the texas chainsaw massacre overall look and feel even if they aren't the first associations in my mind are valid i only wish i could comment on the dvd which i look forward to buying as tourist trap has become notoriously hard to find on video since the near complete extinction of independent video rental outlets where it had a home aside from and cable in the 1980s though tmc showtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now no no spoilers here i'm afraid no plot breakdown go see it yourself all right there may be a tiny little one below so scroll away if you like better safe than sorry the mannequins are damn scary and i'd rather show than tell br br for the record tourist trap is also chock full of great lines from we are going to have a party how do i look huh how do i look to you're so pretty you can't hurt me i shouldn't have to hide it it feels good listen for that vincent price inflection again there the inevitable you're crazy delivered at the right moment and in the right tone and try just try to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the head screaming molly especially once you realize whose head it used to be br br p s charles band was the producer on this i believe and likely owned the rights to music band from what i understand was the brains behind full moon entertainment which might explain both the music's subsequent use in puppet master and well the 40 commercial approach has characterized full moon throughout from the enjoyable puppet master and subspecies franchises to uhhh trancers and bad channels sorry
<START> go up to any film fan and ask them the title of the film which was directed by robert wise with second unit direction by yakima canutt and sergio leone was designed by ken adam and scored by max steiner starred sir stanley baker sir cedric hardwicke and brigitte bardot was filmed in colour scope and stereo at cinecitta in 1955 with a thousand extras and they'll tell you to go away and stop being silly br br they'll tell you that no such film exists that the names you've quoted never worked together they weren't even contemporaneous and that you've just picked the names out of a movie publication at random and are attempting to them br br at which point you can direct them to imdb and show them the cast and crew of helen of troy they'll be amazed this lesser known sword and sandal epic has all these names and more niall janette scott and good old harry andrews br br and it is certainly an oddity after the war 1 000 italian extras cost about 25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of italian cinema the orgy scenes were shot twice one with tops the other without you can guess which version britain and america got i believe even la sophia is an extra in this one br br either way the names stagger the mind but it's really just a coincidence all of said names were either just reaching the ends of their careers canutt steiner or beginning them everybody else br br only robert wise and niall were in the middle of their careers br br for the record leone was uncredited and learning his trade adam still had to invent the descending circle in the ceiling of sets a trademark he'd go on to put into all the early bonds baker had yet to star in and help produce the likes of zulu and robbery and go on to direct a welsh tv company called then die tragically young br br while harry andrews would go on to become one of britain's favourite character actors janette scott daughter would never make the really big time but who can forget her in day of the triffids even though her bit was added later for padding and a happy ending or crack in the world br br sir cedric was theatre but knew how to mug on film and bardot was bardot for br br but what were these stellar people doing in this camp old nonsense don't ask me the two main stars were no name italians helen had a moustache and paris was pretty while the brits were only there for support br br to summarise i think you can just mark this one up as a major fluke in stereo to be honest if i hadn't seen it i wouldn't believe it either
<START> sometimes changes to novels when they're made into films are not only necessary but a good thing however in the case of northanger abbey it's a very very bad thing not only is the story itself ripped to shreds but the satire is almost completely absent from the film and it's mixture of romance and intrigue doesn't even touch upon the biting commentary that austen put into her work it fails to be amusing or satirical at all and instead turns the character's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama br br this affects the romance as well it's meandering and aimless chemistry and interest are never established the reasons is attracted to catherine are completely absent from the film leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all br br hopefully some day soon we'll get a more faithful version if austen's satire
<START> the movie starts out with its most intelligent joke and goes downhill from there pun intended after that there's lots of potty humor and sexual situations the beautiful women were the best part of the movie swear word puns are not meant to be central idea jokes but they try it here the battle between the two groups in the local town and is an old tried and true setup so how could it go wrong well there is no reason to envy the nor any reason to feel sorry for the so we can forget the central plot the situational humor is all toilet or sexual aimed at teenagers but only garners giggles no true belly laughs br br the only thing that salvages the comedy for this movie is the character humor with the blind man providing some rehashed but seldom used setups and the black bar owner providing the formulaic street or hood humor br br ok forget the jokes there has to be some killer shots since this was a commercial enterprise unfortunately there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring the rest was all b grade tricks or worse the big moment where the main character rides the goat a man killer ski run did provide one shot where a small avalanche eats the stuntman this was the best of the boarding in this movie any serious fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie br br as for the technical aspects of the movie the soundtrack was average which surprises as those documentaries are regularly filled with quality tunes you can catch a lot of editing mistakes and even though it was shot on a ski mountain the majority of scenery shots failed to convey any sense of true size br br overall it might be worth watching if you have managed to turn your brain completely off and you like silicon breasts even then you wont remember a thing from this one two days later br br is still waiting for it's definitive comedy you'd do better to watch a documentary for sure
<START> deepa mehta's fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian households this is a film no one should miss shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible a r music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film mehta uses score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it lesbianism is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning
<START> this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time the director did a wonderful job showing the contrasts between social classes a situation that is very pertinent in france today all the characters are lovable especially juliette and her family the development of the romance is while not entirely realistic at least plausible and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love i found this to be a heart warming cinderella story but one in which cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself i laughed through this entire film and absolutely loved it i recommend et juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters comedy and romance
<START> following the collapse of yesilcam answer to hollywood in the mid '90s few but the most prescient of observers could have foreseen such a recent pique in the turkish film industry arguably built upon the work of ex photographer bilge br br is the director's third feature and forms something of a trilogy with his two earlier pictures and clouds of may following similar themes and techniques the film finds mahmoud a commercial photographer living alone in a small istanbul apartment only visited occasionally by his brusque married lover his nephew has left his village home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job the younger man stays with mahmoud while fruitlessly looking for work in the city drinking in cafÃ©s and nervously observing young women he never approaches br br the film's title is translated as distant and the film beautifully illustrates every possible connotation of the word physical distance from his home emotional distance from the world around him and the generational distance between the two men br br films rarely contain heightened dramatics instead allowing full and rich characters to develop from within the tightly framed static shots he acts as director producer writer cinematographer and co editor and casts friends and family in many of the roles such a confined insulated approach to film making might be expected to lead to films hard to infiltrate and connect with for most viewers making undoubted humanity all the more impressive br br is however a better cinematic formalist than dramatist taking the reigns from such past masters of cinematic language as ozu and tarkovsky after viewing i can think of few better suited to the task
<START> great comedy from charlie chaplin i've seen chaplin's 4 major films gold rush city lights modern times and the great dictator and i think it is easily the funniest of the four this movie had me laughing more than almost any other i've ever seen from the very opening disclaimer any similarity between the great dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental the movie is a laugh a minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor and at the same time chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting timeliness of the subject matter but easily a 9 out of 10 for me
<START> i'm at a loss this entire movie made absolutely no sense it was like watching a film for football the camera cutting the pace all so copied i thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was yes we all know southerners like football and beauty must we be inundated with it as an audience i watched because of lee and jay i was expecting young talent assembled in the style of dead poet's society or similar to remember the titans i was completely put off by the film you didn't get the characters it was character driven but you didn't understand anyone's motivations or their actions for the most part the one kid who's mom is obsessed with him being a football player why is he so silent what's his deal did we really need the scene with him proving his heterosexuality why should we care the movie gave us insights into these kids lives and offered no pay off for caring it just made no sense br br and why show a movie about a team that lost i know it's real life but who makes movies about losers give us some pay off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their conceivable problems darnit we got nothing we got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer lee why didn't you follow that story what were we to get out of this one the movie led you along but didn't lead you anywhere i just felt like something was missing it felt like a bad genetic cross between varsity blues and remember the titans at least those two movies led you somewhere friday night lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie the actor who played him was great you were completely annoyed by him which was the point but at least you understood why they made sure you understood him but he couldn't play so why make sure we get his issues br br and the other team in the play offs are we to believe those are high school teens those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s who were they trying to kid i know the other team was to look intimidating but that was crossing the line a little i liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team but again how did this fit into the overall theme of the film nothing pieced together the characters knew more about each other than we did and that settles weird with me jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add but he was showcased it was all just a mess not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee
<START> ken russell directed this weird not very erotic thriller and if i hadn't known that i would have staked my life that the director was brian depalma absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams depalma from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot to even the title this screams depalma depalma depalma br br unfortunately since brian depalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans hitchcock over the years russell should have tried emulating a style of his own sure an erotic thriller in the style of tommy or billion dollar brain would have been bizarre with a capital b but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market oh and anthony perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s yawn br br the only thing of any real note to crimes of passion is the controversy it caused i guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity but as for the controversial sex scenes what controversial sex scenes there aren't any and the only controversy i can think of is of china blue dominating an on duty policeman with a needless to say he didn't come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
<START> i walked into a book store in brentwood tennessee i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real i was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it i had great expectations for it i couldn't believe what i seen when i viewed it it didn't look like a real movie it looked like a home video i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know this is no horror movie you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along i swear i did it never did get any better there were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him i didn't find that entertaining at all i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me i guess that is how bad this economy has got i have this to say to the cast and crew do not show this film as material to get other film jobs don't do it i mean that sincerely i commend you for trying for people who have bought this i say this don't sell your copy to someone they could get very upset have a nice day everyone
<START> i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that you will be thinking man the conan movies were pretty cool this one is totally boring and sucks the story who cares it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film arnold doesn't look like he belongs in this one why he agreed to play the role is beyond me well probably for the money i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine lame this movie is just plain and simply terrible
