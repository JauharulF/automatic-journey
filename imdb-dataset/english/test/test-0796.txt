<START> no matter how you feel about michael jackson himself you can't deny that this video is the most unique video of all time there is no other video that is even remotely close to thriller the first time i saw it was when i was 6 years old and it scared me bad now i watch it with a smile because i can now appreciate the marvel that it is i love this video and it will be around for as long as music videos exist i think everyone should sit down and watch it when its on sometime and look back and see how great it was especially for being 1983
<START> a very interesting addition to the surrealistic collection recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated my interpretation of the ending would be that journey ends in hell he dislikes the bland consumer led emptiness of purgatory a sort of but not progressing i e not getting anywhere even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations it has a metro system like you should be able to travel freedom escape but you can never actually board those trains he is unable to reach fragrant sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination the old norse version of hell hades not hell the terrestrial city isn't burning hot like the british version its cold freezing the land of land of cold and mists this appears to be where andreas end up having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel
<START> mel welles you might remember him as mr in roger corman's little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be do good but rather for its sex appeal you see frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is tissue thin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive comments surprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress rosalba neri aka sara bay bey plays the baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal she oozes desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty one dimensional but she is quite lovely and plays over the top a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift poor joseph cotten now regulated to european horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul muller is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the baron's assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policeman i wasn't buying this mickey hargitay starts to pump for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones
<START> on june 22nd 1941 the city of poland is divided between german and russian when the german invades the city the nazis send the jews to a ghetto the young catholic kellie martin alone with her young sister and hides many jews in the attic of her house along two and half years until the end of the war hidden in silence is another good story of human sympathy in world war ii this film looks like rescuers stories of courage and is also based on a true story unfortunately the actress kellie martin performs a strong and powerful lead character but she is very weak for such a role in many dramatic situations the expression of her face is not convincing i have noted that many imdb users liked her performance but i am not sure whether they like her wonderful character or her performance indeed my vote is seven br br title brazil no hidden in fear
<START> no one said that in the big trail and i thought it would be a natural nevertheless this was one of the best westerns i have seen and i am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies the scope and feel of this picture is simply staggering and as someone mentioned in their comment it does have the feel of the 3 camera triptych of napoleon 1927 nowadays the cost of the production and especially the cast of thousands would be prohibitive but raoul walsh got it done br br the cast was excellent although john wayne was better when he had no lines and just around in particular tyrone power sr was a perfect villain i had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture ian keith was a snake but el is an acquired taste as the comic relief he can be funny or annoying but mostly the latter and he shows up at the most inappropriate times br br it is a bit too long and it took a while for the indians to show up but this is as close to a documentary on manifest destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre preference by the time the settlers got to california i was exhausted
<START> parts the horror is not that bad of a movie i have the mst3k version of it on tape and it is hilarious but its still not the worst film the have ever done i would go so far as to say that it was better than 80 of the movies they have made fun of the concept could have worked if they had a better script more money and decent actors it could have become a classic if it was not so boring and had a bit more excitement sadly it was botched in production and ended up on mst3k
<START> of the thousands of movies i've seen so far this is the first one which made me think of the wasted talents expression i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances pierrot elsa and so on the aging make up is quite awful and to make it worse lit broadly the use of music e g love at first sight for the young aide de camp is at times so that i could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly so far antoine de has been quite a good actor but seeing this one and les de i think he should start considering quitting please antoine give up that master of project i doubt you deserve it
<START> friday night with jonathan ross must have those in charge of ross rubbing their sweaty little palms together they know the bbc lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows so when they have jonathan ross at their disposal they are quite settled to just sit back and let a half wit command this primetime slot br br ross spends most of the show grooming his ego and smiling about how much the bbc is paying him the show is a complete copy of many us chat shows leno letterman conan o brian the list goes on but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the uk also br br the unfortunate situation he has no competition parkinson has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except grooming a celebs ego can't we have someone funnier and slicker on british screens instead of jonathan ross once ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room so trying to get on with each other if an a lister is present which is so often the case these days as there are no other chat shows they can turn to to promote their latest movie he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe when he had ringo starr on a man that cares nothing for licking arse ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number as common policy on this show is for jonathan ross to get everyones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working of course ringo said it how it is and simply said no i don't like you dead pan serious br br ross needs to be axed from all awards and tv shows the masses will get over it
<START> you would probably get something like this i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things br br one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous even in an unrealistic art movie to portray a slavic woman as a half articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three legged stool
<START> this is one of the most awful movies i've ever seen probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless blueberry how can harald even have put his name on this crap i'm feeling every ounce of respect i had for him waning fast br br so what is it about this film that makes it so poor is it the story yes is it the actors yes it it the whole look and feel of the movie yes br br to start off with the story my god it's about as clichÃ© ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14 year old who is late writing his her paper on what i did this summer the feel good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the story br br the actors are amateurs i know and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors but for this to work the characters have to be charming and or funny preferably both so that the viewers don't mind the cheeky acting or perhaps it even adds to the characters in this case not even close baby you start off disliking the characters mildly and by the end of the film i think it's about 90 minutes long although it feels like 4 hours you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys it should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very very embarrassing i'd rather have my sister make a fool of herself on american idol br br finally why cram in a bunch of misplaced norwegian celebrities they look even more out of place than the actors if this is possible these celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inception br br i cannot even begin to stress how much i'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again
<START> this movie was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors that is the premise is interesting and i mean i rented it based on the synopsis the problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept there is no coherent plot no fully fledged characters no real comedy no interesting scenery no surprises and no good performances except jon herder he does something with very little it's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis and if there were enough people like me it may even have made money br br to the prospective viewer don't waste your time there is nothing funny or interesting to see here to the creators of the film hey you got your film made so what if its not that great most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen
<START> i consider myself a fan of jess franco and his trash movies but nearly every time i see one of them i just see missed opportunities and plots that don't play out well this film is unfortunately no different the film certainly had a lot of potential as franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic film 'the most dangerous game' with his usual brand of trashy sleaze but the plot here gets lost too often and it takes an eternity for franco to get round to the main point of the movie with this being a later franco film you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would have got better but actually i've found that the opposite is true as this and the terrible 'killer are two of his very worst films the plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend the pair is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover however they soon find that they haven't been invited there for social reasons as they are 'released' on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them down for sport br br what attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks you'd think then that i'd be pleased that the movie features a plethora of sex scenes and general sleaze but i'm not the reason for this is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is really boring and most of the time served only in giving me the condition known as fast forward however my inclination to see everything through to the end ensured that i had to lump it there was a time when i didn't think girl on girl could possibly be boring but i have since been proved wrong the only positive i can pluck out the movie really is that the soundtrack is quite catchy and despite it being silly foreign pop music actually blends quite well with the sex scenes i did enjoy the last ten minutes as that's when the plot finally got going but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately this is a severely lacklustre film on the whole i only recommend this film to those who feel they must see all 180 franco movies everyone else should watch vampyros lesbos faceless or she killed in ecstasy instead
<START> the submarine used was not 'it' was in fact two boats and both built for turkey by vickers at barrow in but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war was sunk but was eventually delivered in 1945 br br the confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up as i did and found when in fact the last digit of both and was in fact just painted out br br there are some extremely realistic moments in the film these turkish boats were very similar to the s class as no s class submarines survive the shots of them as and of the depot ship forth form part of an interesting record now as well as an excellent film
<START> there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden was sub par both in terms of acting and cheerleading there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film only great character
<START> i believe john the dead is a true classic not only was it final film he is quoted as saying all i know about film making is in this film the story closely adapted from dubliners by james joyce is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by angelica houston john's daughter and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life this is a film that should be part of any serious collection not only because it is visually elegant but because the story is timeless and very appealing the film is not hurried nor is it charged with action rather the story unfolds from within the characters who bring light and meaning to the dialog the end of the film is stunning poetic and haunting i recommend the dead without reservation as one of the finest films ever made
