<START> stephen king tv movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains right so why give the stooges only 96 minutes i'm not asking for a pbs mini series but would a two parter had killed anyone the movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted i do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the stooges but the spirit was there after watching the movie i pulled out a tape from american movie classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly the movie was pretty tough emotionally especially after curly has the stroke and moe needs to keep the business going when curley started crying i lost it like i said the movie was good but could have been and should have been much much better maybe it's fitting though the stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now 25 years later it happens again
<START> slipknot is a hardcore rock band from des moines iowa nine band members who all wear customized and personalized homemade masks eg 6's clown mask 0's various 8's tattered torn mask with dreadlocks the music itself seems to walk the between sane and otherwise yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic br br welcome to our neighborhood sounds rather a generic title but the footage itself is something else interviews with the band soundbites from their latest album 2 live performances and one banned by mtv music video a brilliant homage to the classic kubrick film the shining the movie clocks in at not even half an hour but is certainly worth it it is perfect for introducing any metal hardcore fan to slipknot
<START> one dark night has a typical teen horror film set up with a quite a unique twist the ultra brooding musical score and gothic claustrophobic atmosphere adds greatly to this small film that delivers meg tilly is excellent as julie and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum giving a sense of foreboding and loneliness the other teens are equally effective in their roles as is melissa newman the ultimate heroine of the film the special effects are excellent though dated this film is highly overlooked but that may be good so that it was never ruined by endless sequels there is a great dark magic flowing through this film once tapped into you really get it and you're in for some fun the double disc dvd is available though the original negative could not be found to restore the film maybe someday it will be located i guess in some ways the carbon in parts do help the film by giving it an old school respectability and making it more unexpected at the end when suddenly there are plenty of effects br br the second disc has a rough cut alternate version with a temp score version of the film that gives more explanation of the demise of two of the girls very poe ish the cask of amontillado comes to mind in a new way also great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening not sure it had the punch for main stream audiences but certainly worked for me and extremely creepy also there is a making of documentary that is interesting because it gives info on what was going on at the time with the actors crew director and writer candid material then current logos discussions of shots and scenes rehearsals very unique that this stuff exists for a small film back then
<START> this is a wonderful film as a film it gets an 8 out of 10 as a filmed piece of accurate history one wishes to be more loving but it is a 5 out of 10 and i think i am actually being very charitable br br what was he like that man of horse and saber who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes opinionated militant bumptious bloody handed ambitious clever too clever indian foe indian friend and national hero his death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington lincoln jackson and grant lee and sherman jackson it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career the overly ambitious hot spur that his reputation declined yet to this day george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle i can't really think of a similar one maybe general jonathan wainwright forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march but wainwright survived the march and the second world war br br custer has appeared in more films than far better generals due to the western adventures and little big horn pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film but even in 1941 the legend was still potent olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until 1933 so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth john ford would have fully understood this and approved it br br so we get the view that he was a hot spur but he was patriotic although almost pushed out of west point by which was true custer was in the class of 1861 and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year you see most of the so called military talent from west point from robert e lee down was southern and joined the confederacy the union needed every northern point man they could find br br custer's civil war career should be given closer study he was attached to the staff of general in chief george b and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare but he was a cavalryman and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and sherman's buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek which ended the threat of the confederacy in the valley it also hit custer hard on a personal level his close west point friend stephen joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer mortally wounded custer sat with all through the latter's last night alive br br following the war things fell apart he wanted to make his brevet major permanent it wasn't as it was a battlefield promotion they only had a lt to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier he tried to play politics making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot he supposedly admired the indians he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west but he caused a genuine military massacre in of indian women and children that ended with a court martial later during the 1870s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians that went up to the secretary of war william belknap who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit it ruined belknap and left a black eye on the grant administration it put him into the with grant and sherman who was former commander and sheridan barely saved his career then he was sent on the final big horn campaign and immortality arrived br br that career is worth a real film but would it be too critical should we hold a man of the 1850s 1876 to the standards of 2007 would we like that done to us in a hundred years certainly it could happen but i'm not sure we'd like it br br custer 1941 style fit flynn like a glove with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character in support actors like sidney greenstreet stanley arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends foes or even treacherous sneaks kennedy as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be
<START> this must be the first movie i've rented and not seen to the end complete garbage the acting the plot set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot not even a b move
<START> we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 6 30 a m while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on it is absolutely adorable we need shows like this for children and adults as i'm certainly way beyond my childhood years as one of the other commentaries pointed out this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines the puppets are fantastically cute the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard foam paint and pure imagination they remind us of our own childhoods when we could spend the day at our own grandma's house exploring the world around us for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as nana this show is for you you'll make up for lost time this show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun for children and adults alike in other words don't overlook this show just because you're over the age of three spend a half hour with mona nana mr and russell they'll be friends you look forward to seeing
<START> we saw la at the international film video festival liked it br br this film delved into the fear we all have fear of rejection fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies br br the three lead actors as valeria brigitte as flavia andrea as massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent it was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real br br i believe is a stand out i hope we see much more of her in the coming years br br this film doesn't take the easy way out thumbs up to the italian team who put this film together highly recommended
<START> this film is truly execrable in all departments script acting plot direction and editing are all uniformly awful i give it 1 out of 10 simply because people turned up to make it i would have given it 2 out of 10 if they had all stayed at home instead avoid at all costs
<START> you have to hand it to writer director john hughes with enormous success behind him in the misfit teenager high school vein he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian actor john candy here goof off adult candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother's kids it's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents and it isn't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences still hughes relies almost completely on candy's charm to put the scenario over and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center the kids are sitcom smart the other adults shapeless blobs and amy madigan is too intense too hyped up playing uncle buck's girlfriend later became a tv series which is befitting since the material was already television perfected 1 2 from
<START> this film was great miller and flex did a great job they both look good together and they both pulled it off tasha smith was so funny as the cousin and she couldn't stay out of her business essence held it down for her girl when she needed her was sweet and played a dear grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother and oh i can't forget about the stripper he was so find and i didn't know if i should cover my eyes or smile while i watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen damn he was fine looked flawless and sexy and she stepped up a notch since felicity over all the movie had a lot a list actors and actress it was funny sexy crazy touching loving emotional and wonderful this movie is a must see go it get on dvd now if don't have it
<START> ok i will make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie everybody knows of motion picture association of america's ratings g pg pg 13 r and nc 17 for the purposes of this movie i think the should create a new rating standard iq 20
<START> bad sequels this one's a real one when the first movie was very very bad you have to be fool to make a sequel worse actors worse scenario worse special effects worse movie this is history bad history i give it 0 and a half for laughs out of
<START> 1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen christine the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch christine and cujo were both pretty bad and it's a close run thing as to which is the lesser of the two if pushed for an answer i'd say cujo marginally is the weakest br br donna trenton dee wallace fresh from success as elliot's mom in e t the extra terrestrial is a mother whose marriage to husband vic daniel hugh kelly is hanging by a thread she's been having an affair with a local worker and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton danny son of donna and vic and a pretty messed up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks donna and tad take the family car to a nearby yard for repairs but as they arrive their car to a halt things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic joe ed lauter isn't there he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo a gigantic st bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat soon the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims the weather is hot not a living soul knows they're there the car won't start and the dog seriously wants their blood br br cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller but it never really clicks into gear i've read the book and it is quite disappointing certainly for king so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little on the printed page king was at least able to generate a degree of tension but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st bernard simply isn't very scary the of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st bernard in the book it was possible to forget this in the book cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster even with the relatively short running time of an hour and a half cujo becomes a tedious and patience straining experience occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be they've even omitted the book's cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an all's well that ends well conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation
<START> sorry but jacqueline hyde get it jack l and hyde jekyll hyde has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn not to mention a script apparently written by a first grader with learning disabilities br br jackie hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had guess who yes an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind yes that mr hyde br br despite some nice skin scenes this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter br br as much as poor jackie tries she just can't stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time
<START> latter days is a very very independent movie and compared to many of today's more modern films it's lacking on many parts the shooting seems at times quite amateurish the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not impressively complex so don't have too high hopes for this movie because as i've said it's very independent but whatever it lacks in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the story's charm i cannot claim that the plot is outstandingly original but the story is still beautiful and heart warming in many ways it's not about being gay versus being straight it's about faith and how you decide to run your own life it's a silly story that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time so to be honest latter days is far from perfect but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it it's very critical towards the religious aspects of our society and there is homosexuality involved but approach it with an open mind and i'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself
