<START> most films are crappy with high production values this one is crappy without high production values which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn who i believe if given the proper script could probably turn in a pretty good performance she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh who often refers to her as dude or man in a non ironical tone br br but heres the thing emily is a semi believable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh when we first meet rhett we learn that he is deep because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world uniquely rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emily's few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied br br from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy haha this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome br br i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award oh south by southwest why do you encourage them its only cruel but here is where i hand this film a compliment it is the best of the mumblecore movement mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting but still its good to be the best of something br br i haven't seen yet but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward the preview at least made it appear tolerable where as even the puffy chair preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck i've gotten off topic here anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all much like josh most likely isn't an actual actor but rather the director or brother of director there's some mixed messages there i think rhett was buddy and they said hey why don't you play this guy named rhett in the movie the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same unless i am mistaken which i am not br br if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive so anyways rhett emily and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and josh's dad some stuff happens along the way more bad acting bad supporting actors crappy camera work an attempt at significance this film wouldn't have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance br br the whole thing is amateurish if you can view this movie without paying for it like if its on tv or for rent at the library then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of film making i like what the are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see
<START> i have never read sarah water's book although i have not read the book the 3 hour movie is very interesting it begins with an interesting storyline with a twisted ending i have to say these 2 actresses are amazing sally hawkins is stunning successfully portrayed the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love their romance slowly blossoms as they spend more and more time together the love making scene is very tender and emotional well acted the end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after all they have been thru which is a bless overall it is a great movie to see a very interesting plot with excellent performances
<START> i must say that this movie had a great cast locations music and camera work cameron diaz was great she had a very exciting roll very while jordana brewster had a serious roll yet still capturing one for me very nostalgic she reminds of a female classmate of mine what realy got me in this movie were the very skillfully planned camera work and the choosing of the locations the story is very written it is a must see one the one's who are into mystery movies should watch this one i guarantee you all that it'll keep you in your seats till the end
<START> this is a treat for fans of z grade movies here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything ed wood ever produced veteran bad movie actor cameron mitchell is a former makeup man from paragon studios who after a nasty acid in the face incident at a social gathering becomes an embittered mad scientist tm with a rubber scar on his face who takes revenge by kidnapping paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his secret laboratory tm handily located in the local wax museum or are they zombies who do his bidding he's not sure br br happily many of your favourite movie clichÃ©s are here check out the villain's lab are those mysterious steaming vats of liquid test tubes of coloured water with no explained purpose yay and what ho do we see spare arms and legs arranged kinda casual like on a wooden rack you betcha marvel at the bumbling detectives acting with straight out of plan nine now enjoy a stupidly tame car chase and hear more dizzy bimbo screaming than you could possibly want raise an eyebrow at the screwy plot line made even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie br br cheesy trash and much fun for the bad movie connoisseur
<START> people with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going but the thing is far from being simply a horror classic the fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day cgi is only a small part of why this movie is finally rightfully regarded as a masterpiece technically brilliant in its camera work and editing superbly scripted and acted one of the best openings one of the best endings tension and paranoia sustained throughout with countless viewings an excellent soundtrack and open to multiple readings and analogy there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice absolutely essential viewing
<START> mild spoilers dear kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie i have just been subjected to that stars you the problems are far and wide and painful for me to recount yet i feel i must if only to prevent others from suffering the same anguish as i did this is not a film for anyone under 50 it's soooooo and when the big reunion of ada and happens the biggest and most important scene in the film nothing happens it is a epic letdown now like the director should have done i will keep my words short and end with this warning your film is disjointed boring has no flow and jude law is tragically mis cast he showed more emotion as a robot in a i be warned the film should be retitled bored mountain love ada
<START> is set in los angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard eric phillips co producer don 'the dragon' wilson saves senator robert dilly john from an assassination attempt by a group known as the the union of human rights who are angry at dilly for spearheading the computerised judicial system in which robots called are sent out to determine dispense justice on the guilty anyway eric saves dilly who is very impressed decides to see if he can trust eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor being the fine upstanding guy that he is eric isn't impressed when dilly kills a woman he is asked to keep it quiet eric escapes sets out to bring dilly down however dilly has lots of powerful friends he uses his influence to frame eric have his sent out in pursuit of him br br co produced directed by richard pepin i think films like give films a bad name i didn't like it that much at all the script by hart is pretty predictable it doesn't excite it steals most of it's ideas theme from other better sci fi films the heady mix of martial arts action sci fi don't gel that well there a few fights some car chases a couple of shoot outs but it's all rather bland forgettable the film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future it deals with robots technology the way society is run it's judicial system in particular speaking of which the fantastic robocop 1987 mixed it's violent action clever social commentary brilliantly but doesn't even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement the script basically uses the concept to have robots shoot outs which robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story there is very little in that i can say was entertaining that's what films are about right br br director pepin does ok but nothing stands out it's all rather forgettable it's not particularly exciting the sci fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things as a whole the film doesn't look that futuristic the action scenes are alright there's some exploding cars some shoot outs but nothing spectacular br br technically is average for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated the special effects are poor the acting was bad i wonder if don 'the dragon' wilson signs cheques with that name br br was a waste of my time there is nothing here original or exciting the action is instantly forgettable poor that's all that needs to be said not recommended
<START> this film is a completely inaccurate depiction of the real story of noah's ark the producers probably did not even read the bible this is the worst movie i have ever seen noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the bible but the writers of the film gave her the name this movie depicts the destruction of a good 1000 years before it happened and what about it too was destroyed at the same time was maybe the producers thought that not including in the story and showing the city of as in you know what would raise more eyebrows this film is utter filth and mocks god and the bible it is a wonder that any true christian would want to participate in the production of this abysmal hideous mockery of the bible
<START> it's unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases i e anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that i'm unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about 45 minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length 2 hours that felt like 3 don't get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films 3 hour epics i don't have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scooby doo esquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plot twists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the 3 parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesn't feel right i felt cheated i won't throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here there's a lot of people who seem to really love this so i don't want to give anything away i personally can't stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didn't care there weren't any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if i'm supposed to believe this is reality something doesn't sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldn't get into it i gave this a 3 simply because i don't want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement br br major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldn't fit in another twist your father didn't die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasn't enough does the protagonist need another emotional more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as i've ever been bothered in any film
<START> a woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns helped no doubt by a smooth talking gigolo husband who openly cheats on her naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been accosted by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite much to the delight of her husband this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good br br from the very opening scenes with it's ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny although not too far off the mark this is most definitely not true br br unlike most movies of this genre this is not really a sci fi or a horror film but actually a serious drama which intelligently incorporates a sci fi scenario into the plot it's not a good or even mediocre drama but it will exceed your expectations if you weren't expecting any legitimate drama at all the acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and most importantly it is well edited and excellently paced it is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next nevertheless this is still a movie strictly for those who can't pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like attack of the 50 foot woman
<START> this film was actually shot and made in 1987 but it didn't hit the theaters until 1990 as i watched this film i could see the good intentions that it had but i'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work story takes place in california in the 1890's and some italian immigrants who own are told they have to leave their land so a railroad can come through dennis hopper plays william who has offered money for the land but has been turned down giancarlo giannini is sebastian and he is to proud to leave and asks the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land grows impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to vacate these thugs are headed by a man named andrews burt young and he doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him problems andrews and his men kill one night and his son marco eric roberts vows to seek revenge and get the land back for everyone marco blows up the bridge that the railroad was going to need and they also destroy a tunnel and this sets back the project for several months and now starts to get heat from other investors this film was directed by peter masterson and besides the trip to bountiful he has at best a spotty career in directing he's a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head this was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and its easy to see that it didn't occur roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980's but this is suppose to be 1890 the cinematographer is toyomichi kurita who ended up being a good cameraman but this was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time its not a sharp looking film at all and i noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be glaring off of something and the scenes just don't have the that would have helped the overall look the script is just a revenge story and no surprises take place during the course of the film we know giannini is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time the cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired this was promoted as julia roberts film debut but i'm not sure that is correct she might have appeared in a film called firehouse before this
<START> ok look this show is the worst show on nick night i love so many shows on nick night and i love them when this show came on to nick night i was so annoyed it's such a boring show and it is corny out of all the times i've watched i found one episode slightly funny this show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever this show sums up to terrible give props to fresh prince of bel air and george lopez this show is boring and not the least bit clever this show should have been canceled much earlier i don't think it deserves to be played on nick night alongside some great classic shows this show is lacking cleverness good jokes and style
<START> it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women first of all this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid personally i think this was the best love story i've ever seen and i am very pro gay i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex and it has nothing against anyone who is gay straight or bi unlike so many other shows maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things br br if you want something funny with one of englands best lesley sharp and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you i know i love it
<START> looking backwards to that year 2002 when furia was made one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today's new generation in romania br br the main qualities of furia stand in a very solid script with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing plus a cast of excellent actors all four leading roles are admirably performed both with depth and dragos and andy confirmed since then being two of our best performers today follows them closely and adrian a non professional in real life a graveyard manager cast as was a genuine revelation br br further directing is skilled and expressive creating in a very compelling style that feeling of a fateful night and inescapable destiny one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut never repeated in his subsequent movies va fi and boogie
<START> like a few people i know i came in late on not until 2000 three years later there is no way i'd miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike 'blue for example the crime is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but he's really fitted in well which didn't surprise me gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh with arguably australia's finest crew behind the scenes will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series
