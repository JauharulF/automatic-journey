<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits br br based on another of stephen king's lengthy novellas this takes place in the sleepy little new england town of castle rock also the name of the film's production company where a new antiques store the titular needful things has opened the owner and proprietor leland gaunt max von sydow hides you might say a devilish secret there's an item in his store that everyone in the little town wants a small cash price upfront is first required before a far more sinister price is asked for as suspicion hate and madness tear the town apart it falls to police chief alan pangborn ed harris to restore order and save the town from a terrifying end br br i read the novel of needful things earlier this year and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them like that was going to be any contest but it had been deleted on video and dvd and i couldn't find anywhere to rent it from so i was happy when i finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping trip br br it's one of the cruelest ironies that king novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk as is the case here the material that makes his books great simply doesn't translate into a movie script very well for some reason and i suppose there's always the question why bother watching this when i could be reading the book again instead br br i appreciate that some are simply too lengthy i e it the stand to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included but there's no reason this one couldn't have included all the material from the book as a result a lot of key characters from the book i e ace merrill are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we don't care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation for example we have one character from the book keaton who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no build up to hint at any reason that he didn't get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved all the material in the script to fill in the cracks if you like is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in king adaptations like this br br most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far away from the book but there's also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously can't feel for the daft material they're being asked to perform in the 90s a lot of king's work started skipping the cinema and just being made into made for tv video territory rubbish like this must surely hint at why
<START> is it just me or have all horror movies become nothing more than titties slapstick and an over the top villain who cannot be killed this movie had no point whatever happened to the days of a person being able to escape from the killer as in hostel and at least make the killer a little more realistic victor crowley was the worst killer i have ever seen he reminded me of a demon spawn between quasimodo and leatherface it was over the top that while victor was lying there on fire no one thought to finish the job and the ending was the biggest disappointment of all reminiscent of the soprano's finale i had to agree with the fella behind me when he blurted what the f if i could give the movie a negative score i would have taken care of it
<START> stay far away from this film the fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys this is a truely horrid movie so let's get down to the problems writing and direction it wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive that watched 'scream' and 'i know what you did last a few too many times giant gaping plot holes abound while i can't congratulate them for this movie its nice knowing they're finally potty trained actors or lack thereof only the finest for this film the finest extras ever to grace a screen now starring in their speaking role debut as a disclaimer i have to note that i am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything i recognize a good movie when i see it but i can still giggle and smirk during bubble boy yes folks its true so when i say to avoid something you know i'm not kidding
<START> leland fitzgerald ryan gosling is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic kid when pressured with the question 'why ' he doesn't have an answer while in jail he meets pearl don cheadle his teacher who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps leland figure out why he did it throughout this film we learn all about troubled life including his ex girlfriend becky jena malone his famous father albert kevin spacey and his whole sad life br br this film is matthew ryan second movie and it is spectacular in nearly everyway this is one movie which will leave you thinking in the end and wondering about how it all works the movie is quite dark but if you can handle that then you will realize just how good a film it is br br in this movie there is no bad guy there is no one you can blame for anything that happens there's no stereotyping and the audience does not try to prove leland guilty instead we sit back relax and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the of the movie all the problems depicted in the story are very real drug addiction parental expectations overwhelming sadness they all exist in our world br br ryan gosling gives one of the greatest performances of his career in this movie as the depressed teenager leland his father lives in europe and doesn't really care much about his son the only person he loves is becky but she has problems of her own he knows exactly what he did but as he says in the film 'you want a why but maybe there isn't one maybe this is something that just happened ' there is a why but we don't find out about it until the end as you watch the movie the audience finds themselves amazed that such a young person could know so much about the world leland notices things that people tend to ignore br br a particular thought provoking scene which really affected me was during one of conversations with pearl pearl just cheated on his wife and when leland asks why pearl replies that he's only human then leland says something which never really occurs to anyone why do people only say that when they've done something wrong br br another fantastic acting job was provided by chris klein in the film he plays allen harris the boyfriend of becky's sister julie michelle williams although he is not one of the main characters i found myself amazed at how deep his character was you can relate to allen a lot you know how much he cares for the pollard family it's as if they were his own flesh and blood by the end of the movie you realize just how far he would go to help them br br overall this movie is a masterpiece which has been overlooked by quite a few people if however you take the time to watch it you will most likely see that everything i've mentioned above is true and once you're finished watching it you'll never look at the world the same way again br br 9 5 10
<START> i have always loved brenda blethyn and undertaking betty was no disappointment i saw it on satellite on dreary sunday morning life has been stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things we usually consider dire in a way i wish she would make more movies like this and saving grace brenda blethyn is a great gal for us approaching 60 to see in action she is cute beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and phony not many actresses are out there for us to relate to in a realistic yet comical and or serious way brenda if you see this keep going with gems like this we need more mrs and graces
<START> i did have some expectations from this film because 1 it was a yash raj production 2 when the songs were first shown on tv they seemed catchy 3 the star cast was new well i must tell u that i just couldn't sit through this movie with his red lips what were the make up artists thinking tries hard to look cool but fails miserably i won't even get started on his acting if u can call it that queen' with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration i think was slightly more tolerable than her she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister the story is pathetic the same old tried and tested formula absolutely no originality there is nothing worth watching in this movie makes me wonder why it was made in the first place
<START> if you like the 80's rock you should definitely see this movie i've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it br br overall the movie is very entertaining provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do i find boring it was a great idea that some of the real life musicians were in this doing what they do best i was happy to see as well as elias they all delivered solid performances i tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one specially in the terms of the script that could have been worked on a bit better but not a major biggie one thing that did bother me a bit was jennifer aniston's performance i thought she wasn't the right person for this role i just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend but as the movie goes on you somehow realize that she did a good job with this there is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold br br to summarize a good and a funny movie that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by jeff scott soto and mike
<START> i enjoyed the movie very much everything in the italian job is simple an explosive guy a safe cracker a computer genius a wheel man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun this film is entertaining although it has no central idea it is a non stop movie with lots of actions all the stunt work is gorgeous from the speedboat chase in venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter the best boast chase i have ever seen i like the mini coopers the expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars the chase between the mini coopers and the motor bikes is amazing they chased underground i can say there was not a moment i was bored mark wahlberg charlie charlize theron stella donald sutherland john jason statham handsome rob seth green lyle mos def left ear and edwin norton steve really did a good job i like the actors in this film i have seen a lot of heist movie but the italian job is one of my favourites a great hollywood action movie without a drop of blood after all i do love this kind of movie
<START> the patriot nothing to do with the mel gibson film of the same name came out steven seagal was still doing that 'saving the thing in his movies which is fine but it doesn't make for good action br br when the plot of this film finally kicked in i saw the twist coming a mile off seagal's anti warfare care for mother nature stance is not very subtle for a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a tv movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by dean the photographer of dances with wolves br br steven seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring as an action film it fails as a drama it stinks as an environmental message it's obvious avoid like ebola crossed with plague
<START> beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesn't really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them don't bother if you want simple entertainment this not for you br br i could about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i won't if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film
<START> me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again he had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions he is an accomplished trip and fall guy and i remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally certainly he is the one to teach people this art he only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did pshaw this program shows how multi talented he is i am lost as to why david jason another series being made as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and i've been a fan of his since he did this series it is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career well to my mind that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it but now his career has progressed so far i believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his secret life full of blunders that he does not see rod
<START> what was he thinking how sad an actor as tremendously talented as michael rapaport who stole our hearts in mighty aphrodite and fascinated us in ill town has sunk to this pathetic level the writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped shame on all involved there is a trend major movie actors that are no longer hot merchandise are turning to tv often with disastrous results reference the on cbs and nbc however abc has a hit with boston legal hip writing and great nostalgic use of bill shatner to waste michael rapaport in this all in the family rip off is an insult to viewers and mostly michael himself
<START> two things are changed from then first of all i am not a kid anymore and second most of new seagal movies are just terrible this is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with derailed starred by jean claude van damme there is no plot in this movie the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch i love action movies but this is not an action movie this isn't a movie this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies i am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie he has a serious intelligence problem then i hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the future good luck for him
<START> dick and jane harper jim carrey tÃ©a leoni wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty br br i've always been a fan of jim carrey it's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it even though the film was funny it was still kind of disappointing it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be it's worth watching once though unlike most of carrey's movies it doesn't have a good repeat value part of the problem is the script i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard if jim carrey wasn't in it than the film would have been a lot worse br br next to jim carrey is tÃ©a leoni she's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny she doesn't match up well with carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance they should have gone with someone else the supporting cast includes alec baldwin richard jenkins and aaron michael jenkins the latter plays billy harper and he actually gives a decent performance he wasn't as annoying as most child stars are alec baldwin was okay and richard jenkins tried too hard to be funny to be honest i'm a little bias here the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim carrey's performance fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but that's about it in the end fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable rating 6 10
<START> get shorty out of sight jackie brown and even 52 pick up folks were finally getting elmore leonard right making good movies out of his work so despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be i couldn't resist renting it i thought how bad can it be oy what a mistake especially right on the heels of reading the book which was lame and too self referential too relative to the rest of elmore leonard's books still the book was better than the movie leonard again trumps the weak and unskilled screen writers who try to take over his book the dialogue written for steven tyler was painful to watch and the lyrics to the character linda moon's first song my middle schoolers write with more depth sad sad sad why even give it a star because harvey keitel and uma thurman are still fun to see on screen and andre 3000 didn't make a complete fool of himself
