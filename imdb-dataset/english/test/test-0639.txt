<START> is an italian fantasy film l'isola degli uomini pesce bought by roger corman and released through his new world pictures of course corman has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys dan t miller direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states br br l'isola degli uomini pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the island of dr moreau it is and claudio cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts claudio comes across the stellar barbara bach and richard johnson johnson plays the dastardly edmund a man who is able to manipulate scientist joseph cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deep sea diving creatures they look like a cross between the black lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the deep by convincing cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives br br having discovered the lost city of atlantis is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures sexy barbara bach plays daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations in one memorable scene bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gill creature and then all hell breaks loose br br filmed at the same time and in the same location as zombi 2 richard johnson didn't even have to change suits between films the house where the experiments take place is the same house johnson uses to conduct experiments in zombi 2 talk about economic filmmaking br br the additional footage features a few bloody beheadings way to go roger and a laughably bad cameron mitchell doing his best pirate imitation all that's missing is the parrot br br spanish title le continent des
<START> when i saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had mostly filled with robots br br i can relate to problems and i have a similarity to shiro and this is a great film to watch if you're a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me all in all watch it before it's out of print
<START> proof if ever more was needed that an action movie irregardless of its budget can look better with more setups or cameras closer shots and many more cuts the generation has moved on to john woo deep fault could be better for a work over in the cutting room ray
<START> i have to admit that although i'm a fan of shakespeare i was never really familiar with this play and what i really can't say is whether this is a poor adaptation or whether the play is just a bad choice for film there are some nice pieces of business in it but the execution is very clunky and the plot is obvious the theme of the play is on the nature of debt using the financial idea of debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions that becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with shylock which unfortunately descends into garden variety anti despite the bard's best attempts to salvage him with a couple nice monologues br br outside of jeremy dignified turn i didn't think there was a decent performance in the bunch pacino's yiddish consists of a slight whine added to the end of every pronouncement and some of the better shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard pacino gets angry scene that his fans know and love but lynn collins is outright embarrassing to the point where i would have thought they would have screen tested her right out of the picture early on when she goes incognito as a man it's hard not to laugh at all the things we're not supposed to laugh at with joseph fiennes standing there trying to look sincere and complicated it's hard not to make devastating comparisons to gwyneth paltrow's performance in shakespeare in love the big problem however that over rides everything in this film is just a lack of emotional focus it's really hard to tell whether this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy or a strangely silly drama surely a good summer stock performance would wring more laughs from the material than this somber production the actors seem embarrassed to be attempting humor and unsure of where to place dramatic and comedic emphasis all of this is basically the fault of the director michael radford who seems to think that the material is a great deal heavier than it appears to me
<START> crystal voyager is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in australia an american by birth george has surfed and photographed himself friends and recently dolphins in australia for 35 years all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back board or boat in the mid 70s he teamed up with surf mag editor and budding film maker david to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography the 75 minute feature crystal voyager is the result even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film neither surf ing movie nor surf movie because george swims about on a children's zippy board not a real surfboard it offset the tedious droning of george occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to pink floyd music in 1974 when the sydney opera house opened it also contained a cinema crystal voyager was booked in there as an arty sporty oz pic and by default became a hit as the house cost far more than a movie ticket audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the sydney opera house' so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there' this created this myth that the film was a huge crowd and the reputation spread as a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon fantastic planet and had a trippy run through the uk and europe as a double feature i ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all recently george has re emerged lord of the flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called dolphin glide that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of byron bay it is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how george did it' short each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in january 2005 all of which makes crystal voyager a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago however at a special oz surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films so the damned thing another box office binge how many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation however since 1975 has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded australian and international films look up no worries or starstruck or undercover or rabbit proof fence or love in limbo for clear and present applause at his achievements george however is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film or drop a camera on
<START> i blow hot and cold over carnÃ© he really can be a puzzle for me i think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation certainly a man who came to maturity in the thirties with the popular front seems ill at ease in the france of the fifties with its rampant commercialism and heavy american influence he is almost thirty years older than his young stars and it shows the party scenes go on much longer than they should as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work roland character he plays pascale older brother seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old style ideas are still sound br br at two hours this picture is far too long still let me praise pascale petit for her game performance she was a natural who should have challenged brigitte bardot for sexpot supremacy but somehow lost her way andrea is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants to marry her and make her baby legitimate yes they still thought that way in the fifties laurent is the only french actor who could play an anarchist convincingly he is great here as he rescues a cat from death then remarks he can't stand cats jacques only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor with that constant little grin and those blank eyes
<START> excellent cast story line performances totally believable i realize the close knit group that exemplifies the marine corps but this movie brought fear to my heart the marines let principles be damned it seems that this film was based on real life incidents it shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment anne heche was utterly convincing sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering and eric stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the corp but also his loyalty to his client while high above on his tightrope he knew what his true course of action had to be but he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition loyalty to the corps above all else i sat riveted to the tv screen all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10
<START> mr accident is a deliberate series of non stop disasters and near death experiences reminiscent of saturday warner brothers cartoons like the coyote who falls off the cliff 5 times per episode the leading man more like an over grown klutzy child always manages to postpone his meeting with the grimm reaper br br this australian surprise is offensively unfunny and at times even depressing the 2 out of ten are is for the visual stunts some never attempted by anyone since daffy duck and the use of vivid colors like in those high class national laundry commercials br br there may be an age bracket where this comedy finds a following i have definitely passed that age long ago calling all preteens here's a ha ha for ya
<START> this movie had potential to be a good little high school thriller instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting the problem was there were too many unnecessary things a fight with the boyfriend random friends coming over to be killed it was obvious they were just killing time the main character was bland and uninteresting camilla bell had no emotion during this movie she was just there another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat the children survive so it's obvious they are going to let jill survive the only reason this got a four was because the last ten minutes when the killer finally comes out is actually exciting br br 4 10
<START> from the get go you won't be able to look away and you won't want to the melancholy of no is one of the most entertaining animes i've seen in a long time if you can look away from the insane and sometimes perverse humor it's easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work br br part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order so you may not understand some of the things they talk about at first but as the series progresses you'll find yourself saying ah so that's what they meant even though this might confuse some people after watching the show you'll be hard pressed to make a case against telling the story in this fashion br br after all the focus is on the characters the title character is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime ever her opening speech to her class in which she declares she is not interested in normal humans and is searching for aliens and time travelers is absolutely bizarre but she's lovable that way br br then there's the normal guy who is pulled into the madness surrounding san he's the narrator and his quick wit always makes the scene that much more entertaining he finds himself caught in the middle of various factions all trying to influence and the other three characters are representatives of these factions ironically they are the very beings is searching for and yet they cannot reveal themselves to her br br the first is yuki a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school literary club and also a representative of the integration thought entity she is basically an alien though the best description of her is a computer program in a human body her purely emotionless responses make her comically deadpan and always make you think there's more than meets the eye then there's the time traveler who happens to be incredibly cute a major ditz and the subject of plans to advertise her club the sos brigade to the world the end result is that does things to her that border on sexual harassment making her dress up in fetish uniforms the final character is the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who happens to be though he can only use his powers in certain conditions br br the end result of all these characters is a comedy unlike any other that is both crude and deep and always brilliant don't believe me watch the first episode their student film you'll see what i mean
<START> this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn't drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep who's performance was extraordinary the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee brava bette midler out of 5 stars i give this one 4 1 2
<START> i saw this episode of masterpiece theatre and immediately came to imdb to look it up i was greeted by a comment from another user who believed that it was nothing special a 6 out of 10 and underwhelming i would feel morally remiss if i didn't disagree br br now i am an avid fan of masterpiece theatre but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television for example he knew he was right was absolutely horrendous carrie's war however is probably the best i've seen so far the entire cast does an excellent job and it held my interest more than any other piece i've seen recently the character mr evans is of particular interest and through subtle images of for example an untouched birthday cake or a ring my opinion of him went from bad to truly good truly his ultimate demise and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for me br br the end is gratifying in every sense but one that everyone did not get what they deserved but overall things worked out i absolutely recommend this to everyone
<START> pity the poor reviewer who disliked didn't understand this wonderful film what a sad life he must lead br br this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i've ever seen yet it's not dark or preachy like the ordinary people type of film it is mostly humorous though not technically a comedy br br the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy perhaps midsummer nights' dream beautiful intelligent women abound with wonderful cinematography and a non insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat br br i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re run on cable it's like re reading a favorite treasured book
<START> this game was terrible i think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn't do much with the gameplay which is the most important part i mean the visuals look incredible but is the game really fun no i mean it's like hey let's jump off buildings and all i'm doing is holding up and a x the game play just isn't there and i don't agree with what did because they had this hot girl the producer of the game jade raymond and they were like ok we've got this hot girl let's pimp her and if you go to gaming websites you're not gonna see gameplay stuff of assassin's creed you'll see her face with a microphone and it'll be like we interviewed jade raymond about her favorite cookies it's like man shut the f k up who cares apparently a lot of people do because they bought the game and like it i mean compare this game with super mario galaxy a wii game that really doesn't abuse the wii remote but still is very innovative and delivers in the most important part gameplay they were able to do a bit of everything with mario galaxy the graphics were still stunning the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing and that's a game that deserves game of the year not assassin's creed man it doesn't even deserve to even be a nominee for game of the year the hype around this game where it was like oh it's the next generation of gaming really i think not so let me get this straight here because i think the people liking this game are only liking it because they're jade fans so i'll tell you guys jade will not make out with you or anything if you love or defend this game if you want a real game on the ps3 get uncharted drake's fortune if you want a real game for the xbox 360 get call of duty 4 and a ton of other games too and if you want a real game just in all the systems get super mario galaxy i know this comment will be hated by many but seriously pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff is that really a fun game the only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it'll end up being more innovative and fun and this game just isn't it br br 1 3 10 a living hell
<START> i must say that i wasn't impressed at all probably because i was expecting much more from this movie maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life not just a few lines so if you expect something to think about after you see this movie don't it's more psychological than philosophical i vote 4 because of the end it clears up a bit and because i have a great respect for bbc documentaries there are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense it was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution too bad that this wasn't the main subject ah i just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is quite boring and in a way cruel
