<START> i watched the premiere of path to paradise way back and was stunned by it dramatic license and all i lived in nyc brooklyn a few years and kept in mind today given the links to groups such as al queda and the islamic jihad i see it as a warning not recognized by our government for that i place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders 9 11 01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of gov't and there is no excuse for our gov't to prevent it period path to paradise was but a dramatic view of the '93 preview and no one cared now nearly 3 000 deaths later and years behind we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve
<START> remnants of an ambushed army unit hook up with a group of cowboys to fight their way through indians on the warpath sounds like it could be an exciting western but this one is dull dull dull it moves like molasses the action scenes are uninspired the acting is pedestrian the writing is flat even the photography isn't very good eastwood in a very early role plays an ex confederate who doesn't like the idea of fighting on the same side as yankees that's about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie but eastwood wasn't experienced enough an actor to pull it off and his character comes across as petulant rather than angry or embittered a very ordinary western actually a very less than ordinary western worth a look if you're a die hard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career otherwise don't bother
<START> this was the very first movie i ever saw in the theatre by myself i was 7 years old and to this day it is one of my favorite movies it's pure smarmy cheese the cartoon was marketed towards young girls selling dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads one for every colour of the rainbow with their own special animals and even a talking rainbow horse typical of the time period each show was about how hope togetherness and magic can make 'everything all br br the movie concerns the coming of spring when all the light and colour returns to the world but this time it just isn't happening for our lovely hero a spoiled princess plots to overtake the soul and implied life giver of the universe which happens to be a giant diamond for her own devious purposes with no regard for reality and now rainbow and her newly found friends orin onyx and chris must save the universe as i said before it's cheesy but it's cute and it's exactly like all of the other cartoons from that time period like the movies strawberry shortcake rose petal and the smurfs all movies created to sell dolls to kids and it works
<START> this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isn't the movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated if the whole movie had been animated it might have been good i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on on a scale of 1 10 i give this movie a score of 100
<START> the fun that was present in the other 'movies' has all but disappeared with this third effort which means the rubbishy production values show through more than ever another 2 parter 'the chinese cobbled together this one suffers from too much padding not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park apartment and printing press nicholas hammond is as endearing as ever struggling valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast the plot in which peter and spidey help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence doesn't exactly scream 'comic book sprung to life' does it
<START> bubbling just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea actually it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime this film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too it has the whole bakery br br detective mitch preston robert de niro has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash cop slash actor named trey sellars eddie murphy when preston's partner is shot he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a newsman and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase rene russo in the first of many errors and oddities in the movie that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film br br de niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how tv cops don't act like real cops funny thing is as the movie progresses his character and murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichÃ©s they supposedly clash so strongly with in a smarter movie de niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment here it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny the team of writers and director tom dey who made the far superior shanghai noon a few years ago see that movie instead seem to be on unsure footing and instead of slamming the tv industry they really let them off light the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm br br with little on screen to keep my attention my mind began to wander and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes for instance if showtime the name given to the cop show is such a popular smash why doesn't anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job for that matter if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy vargas is being televised why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail then again given this villain's actions maybe i shouldn't be surprised this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new without approval jeopardizing a deal and then dispatches him how by using about ten of the to level his entire house of course that's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire br br occasionally showtime gets laughs but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time even worse the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this after a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters that remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests russo's character shouts that's great television ' perhaps it's great television but it's far from a great movie
<START> did uwe boll seriously just rip off the basic idea and dialogue from se7en why is it so difficult for this douchebag to be original he even mentioned in an interview with that he chooses stuff like games to make into movies because the characters plots backstories and so on are already there and ready for him to screw with br br guess it isn't too much of a stretch for him to rip off another movie entirely br br i mean seriously what the hell here's something i made in uwe's br br http com art uwe boll is a douchebag
<START> is one of the best new danish tv series that i have watched br br the series is about the danish police force's unit 1 a kinda fbi style team that help solve murder cases all over the country and the cases they work on plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team br br i didn't expect much when i started watching this series i was pleasantly surprised the series is exciting sometimes fun it's got both drama and suspense i love it
<START> french cinema sucks down with all these visions with their my god am i cultivated distinguished attitudes pestilence to conceited symbolic film language and impervious i'll no longer have a mind for that carax did you ever think about that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid maybe i'm too common to understand you or had it been your task to confirm all the clichÃ©s of a frenchman the world can have guillaume the to be comes to his home palace mme deneuve not in the picture plays the flute here am i darling in this moment i knew that she's in the bathtub and we ll see her lying in there soon don't misunderstand me i'm not prudish and the sex scene was the climax of the film but this is in berlin we say what means something like a self satisfied and the worst seen that often in french movies i can tell other example she beautiful and willing is looking at herself in a mirror combing her hair and her wild bearded dirty young guru into the room breathless shouting there's no escape there's no escape forty years after and what's new what's exciting about my god there's that woman and she loves and admires you what would be more natural to be happy with your life and when you're not please explain much better why born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza no escape is that the point
<START> well the movie has catherine zeta jones in it it's a hallmark television movie it's from a thomas hardy novel it has catherine zeta jones in it she is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class oh yes it has clive owen in it i'm not british so that means almost as much as being a thomas hardy novel except he was in the bourne identity and i liked that that just about wraps it all up folks that really all there was i'm becoming repetitive but i do like so i stuck it out to the end the computer is telling me that i don't have 10 lines and i keep counting them i always count 11 but maybe it just doesn't like my style but that is my opinion of the movie too
<START> i was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater even though i payed 4 bucks for matinÃ©e before 6pm prices br br the remake's story was ho hum the cgi were lame the were to mimic today's fads no i did not think the chick was hot at all the re killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel overall just a sad bad remake br br i'll take rod taylor and the fat glowing eyed surfer over this junk any time my estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever wanting more youth br br when the 60s version came out i first saw it in the 70s for summer fun it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up you don't have to have an over abundance of cgi in a movie for it to be better too much of this looks fake i can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game 3 stars out of 10
<START> i wouldn't recommend this to anyone except cinema goers who like to laugh at a film not with it br br quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i won't spoil it but basically the most over used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film ever br br the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at on screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washington's finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washington's finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and shook my head br br the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se7en but here it is executed far more simplistically and far too obviously to call it a poor mans se7en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washington's best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film
<START> a stupid movie with a stupid plot feels like they threw every imaginable clichÃ© in a blender i especially liked the part where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water because we all know how dedicated america is to conservation of the environment kyoto anyone and the french chef who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger this is why people think americans have no culture that and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to europe to see the world i e eat at mcdonalds in foreign capitals they are not as dumb as the two ditsy preteens in this movie but they have just about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners
<START> i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company br br attended the uk premiere last night zane and brook attended they probably knew i was gonna be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes br br but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongue in cheek was intended if so pure genius if not career genocide br br on the plus side zane always shines and brook can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema avec broken ribs they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be marooned
<START> a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems when the wife disappears her sister begins a vigorous search involving the local police state government and a television crime show what she finds out stuns the entire community good drama with lots of fine performances based on a true story
