<START> while aeon flux was mildly entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a wednesday evening than the pub i did leave pleased that i had got buy one get one free tickets knowing nothing about the film as i went in in fact i didn't even know there was an animated series before i read this site i was ready for anything and as some other viewers noted the trailers showing a well filmed good looking and interesting piece of cinema had pulled me in half way through the film though i was kind of disappointed it did remind me of the fifth element but i too feel it just lacked the extra bit of depth and left me with the empty feeling and enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun fights if you're going to do them do it with some style not just loads of explosions and inept guards falling down personally i'd rather have seen a bit more about the story and the people in the city or got to know more about how the chairman was being undermined than yet another long and loud gun fight
<START> this is a known fact mr seagal cannot smile he can act he can kick butt there are faint smiles no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie we see an over weight mr seagal as dr wesley maclaren who is in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter made an appearance as his office assistant story okay so wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter holly they sit and enjoy their red flower tea and and on the other end of town some over weight militia leader decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an antidote problem there is no antidote and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while the cia are contacted and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill daughter holly so she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather who is a native indian together with his sister in law ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time and to shorten the moment neither ann or wesley are infected by the virus hmm one weak fight scene terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stair master
<START> i went into this movie with an open mind i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie and my friend returned with this i promised him i wouldn't laugh at his choice but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise we kept watching just hoping it would get better but no a continual mind rape followed br br this movie was probably one of the worse ever committed to film and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100 i really don't know how this got distributed the lighting was poor i have seen better acting in elementary school plays there is really nothing positive to say about it
<START> i rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering i like this type of movie and considering who was in it but boy was i wrong the acting stunk the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of known people to be in it but didn't cast anyone with acting ability to play the lead i noticed some people gave it a 10 why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse a 10 you can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy you have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasn't intending maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think it's fun to mislead people you're playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do if the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie i gave this movie a 4 and am glad that i was able to check this out for free from my library cause this movie sucked and really isn't worth paying a cent to see
<START> it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good hard indeed but this one makes him look good very good actually it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a bravura performance br br the acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed the fault was in part let us be fair that the plot bore as much resemblance to the hg wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the colander my this kitchen has a remarkable lot of holes unless that is holes are your bag in which case this film will commend itself to you br br the fault in the other part was that these were demotivated jobbing dvd actors who knew full well one assumes that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the 5 dvd shelf and overpriced at that br br so should you watch it why yes of course you should you are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment
<START> i first saw this movie on an alaska airlines flight and have since seen it twice more it simply is and is simply one of the best films in years i found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing but a little cloudy on what had happened after seeing it again a few weeks later things began to fall into place it wasn't confusing just deep in fact the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time for example it occurred to me only after my third viewing that sammy davis jr jr grandfather's dog is more than just a pet perhaps she's the stand in for his dead wife witness how fiercely he protects her there is symbolism galore and none of it sappy or indulgent just real the adventure of their trip keeps the story line in perpetual motion and even when they arrive you're not sure if it really was the destination as the movie continues so does the adventure and i got the sense the destination was merely a way point the sound track is fun the scenery compelling and both decidedly eastern block i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but i'm not entirely sure i've discovered all the nuances yet besides it's more fun to tease these out yourself as much as any film can be everything is illuminated has proved to be like a fine wine that with time i highly recommend seeing it twice
<START> i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing fun filled thought provoking movie the absence of sex vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene but that's probably because i live a short distance from there even so this film could have been produced in any city it's the theme that's so important here i'm just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us try it you'll like it
<START> i was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the far cry game had been created the story here is not something i would consider to be a strong point in the game universe no worries though as in typical boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on now i understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke it has been said a million times before but why couldn't someone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie
<START> a documentary about a nomadic tribe in tibet going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing but this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast whereby you partake of a rapidly vanishing morsel of humanity the superstitions the epic songs and poetry the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life are something the west had in the times of homer but that is now unfortunately completely foreign to most of us in the developed world we have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well established patterns of life often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society the film makers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and scrappy and made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture so disconnect your land lines turn off your cells turn off the driveway lights and sit back and ease yourself into a timeless adventure
<START> i find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the a bomb and it's development for decades after the manhattan project was completed my suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the movie and entertainment industries in the 1950s through the 1970s with mccarthyism and related national security phobias including the hollywood blacklist there was one film in the 1950s with robert taylor about col paul who flew the gay in the hiroshima bombing but otherwise nothing else one could glance at a side issue tragedy the sinking of the u s s indianapolis soon after the delivery of the bombs to in robert shaw's description of the shark attacks on the survivors in jaws but the actual trials and tribulations of oppenheimer and their team was not considered film able br br and then in 1989 two films appeared i have reviewed one already day one which i feel is the better of the two in discussing the lengthy technical and emotional and political problems in the manhattan project the acting of brian dennehy as general and david as oppenheimer was first rate and neatly balanced small side vignettes concerning the anti bomb crusade of michael tucker help fill out the story well br br that's the problem here paul newman is a great actor as is mr dennehy but newman approached in a different way that while not dreadful is lesser than intelligent but soft spoken military brass newman seems too popped eyed about the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the after school yard with yes it certainly was but the real would have been more like dennehy keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future but on the business of creating that great toy br br dwight performance as helps maintain the film's basically interesting and good production aided by bonnie bedelia as his wife but the most interesting aspect of this film is in the upgrading of the two tragedies of and in particular the latter in the character of john cusack's merriman inevitably in all technological advances people are killed it's just that these two tragedies on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in hiroshima and nagasaki brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a so called peaceful controlled experiment the two tragedies particularly louis slow agonizing death by radiation poisoning showed how much care was needed in using atomic power and how the barest of chances could still cause disaster the only really different thing i saw in cusack's performance and the script and the actual incident with was that actually took some time after the accident to figure out where all his fellow research scientists were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident he was able to show that only he got the full effect of the accidental blast so that only relatively minor treatment would be needed by the others perhaps the full story of actions was too technical for the screen but given the humongous pain he suffered in the end that he took time off to think of the others shows what a first rate person he really was
<START> i've never made one of these before but this movie was literally so bad i had to say something about it br br i'm all for independent film making as the past year has seen of the worst in my opinion of hollywood's showings the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about that being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation br br the characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with the direction is horrible the plotting is horrible the plot itself is horrible stay away far away only one brief scene featuring a female's nude breasts and even that wasn't worth a second look br br the scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again i gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible it earns one point for each of those traits
<START> i have never seen the original 1930s version of the film but this remake is one of the worst i have seen from a major production studio in years seeing actors such as meg ryan and annette bening once near a level talents sleepwalk their way through poorly scripted roles is painful there appeared to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this film br br jada pinkett smith and debra messing play worthless roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value jada pinkett smith's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern having an african american lesbian character but in actuality she is there to just look cool there is no actual reason why messing in this film other than to fill out the amount of women in the original i take br br the side characters played by eva mendes and debi are stereotypical female characters with mendes portraying the vixen looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected husband and covering the gossip roles br br the movie is boring lacking charm humor or sympathy for any characters it almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved whether in front of or behind the camera br br there is one glimmering hope in the film however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is cloris leachman leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film in the small role that she has
<START> when you watch a seagal movie you expect good action you expect fighting not just a lot of shooting like in this flick and you expect a rather simple story ok i can live with a more complex story even though it's a seagal movie but this one this is i don't know what to say it's very very confusing indeed at the end of the movie i had major problems figuring out what had happened and i know i'm not the only one the story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's happening in the movie there are many people in the movie people change sides all the time and it switches locations too often terrible i just don't understand why it looks like seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one
<START> hi this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the day when i watched this movie i was having high fever but still i watched the movie with lots of patience and after watching the movie i felt like repenting because i wasted 3 hrs for this stupid movie i could have taken rest rather then watching this movie and i was really surprised that how come actors like sunny deol akshay kumar etc acted in this movie br br i don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a film then why do they remain as directors why can't they sit at home and spent their time at home br br i request to all directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences either by mail or by media newspapers radios etc to send them a nice story if they don't find any good story for to make a film i request again to all directors please don't make such films
<START> this royal rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days gimmick and image are more popular then wrestling ability br br hbk vs edge pretty good match a lot of heat for edge who was just starting out as a heel again and what better way to go into a match with hbk it kind of got a little slower at the end then usual overall this match gets a 6 10 undertaker vs not a good match undertaker had to carry through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves it did get interesting to see gene and a bit later kane come into this match overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended 2 10 kurt angle vs jbl vs big show this match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when angle managed to speed up the match kurt angle did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match jbl and big show put on a slow match the ending to this match was bad over all this match was a 5 10 because of kurt angle randy orton vs hhh good match surprising heat for randy orton who was the face in this match randy proved he can go the limit with any top star this match also marked the first match hhh has wrestled where someone dosn't run down and save him from a loss over all this match was about a 6 10 br br royal rumble match was ok some surprises some not so good surprises i was kind of upset that kurt angle wasn't given enough time in this match but over all this match had a guy who i never thought would be pushed so soon i won't tell ya who wins i give this match a 8 10
