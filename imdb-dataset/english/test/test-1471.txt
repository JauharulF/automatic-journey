<START> it's a thoroughly successful example of a 1950s biopic it has the stalwart and handsome young hero well not so young anymore on screen superb if unlikely direction by billy wilder a stirring fully orchestrated musical score of uplifting scales and when required heavenly strings by franz waxman strong supporting players a gripping story stunning photography by hitchcock favorite robert and a narrative about a singular historical event br br the film begins with jimmy stewart as charles lindbergh trying to get some sleep in a long island hotel before his epic solo flight across the atlantic from new york to paris and he can't sleep br br the flight itself is filled with flashbacks to personal history and the purchase and construction of his unique high wing the spirit of st louis st louis missouri is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight even in 1927 money talked anyway the movie had to have multiple flashbacks and stewart's narration what's the alternative observing the thirty three hours of watching jimmy stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy airplane while days and nights come and go i found the script and the direction impressive for their time unpleasant things are of course left out so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience might manage br br my bet is that the howling mob that surrounds lindbergh at le ripped the airplane to pieces for souvenirs and of course nothing about the pilot's relief tube though it would have added more opportunities for humor some of today's viewers will find some incidents corny if they think too much about them aloft stewart chats with a friendly hitch hiking fly that in its own quietly concerned way wakes him up by landing on his cheek at a critical moment later the st christopher's medal that father gave him taps gently against the glass crystal of one of the instruments just as stewart is desperately trying to land the atheist stewart is saved twice once by a fly and once by god br br but never mind that it's an impressive film that landing at le with an exhausted stewart behind the joy stick confused by sweaty with fear and collapsing with fatigue is really convincing i'm going to tear this airplane up he tells himself and we can believe him br br flying a light plane is not at all like driving a car there is no smoothly curving highway to tell you where to go no lanes to provide guidance you're busy every second you must watch the instruments check each wingtip to see that they touch the horizon ditto the nose and constantly watch up down and sideways for other traffic although that last wouldn't have been much of a problem for lindbergh he was all alone over the ocean br br why in one of the movie's moment stewart and murray hamilton two gypsy of the 1920s are lounging near their airplanes in a midwestern field what is it what makes us love flying so much asks hamilton no answer later his financial backers try to talk him out of the flight five other have already died trying it but don't you understand it has to be done says an impassioned stewart br br well that's not much of an answer either why does it have to be done now and why by lindbergh why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime the answer dear socrates lies partly in our glands pilots are a placid and confident lot given to occasional arousal their chief problem may be an addiction to an internal rush of adrenalin just kidding some of my best friends are pilots still lindbergh must have been quite a guy he deserved to be treated as a hero not just because of the flight itself but because of his later demeanor quiet modest a family man we can easily forget his admiration for hitler since he more than made up for it by testing corsair fighters in the pacific and advising the navy on how to tweak the airplanes and get the best performance out of them br br see it if you have the chance if nothing else it's a history lesson told with visual splendor
<START> i liked the movie but it should have been longer the actors did a great job de rossi is a fabulous actress and kristoffer is a hottie he didn't look like john at 100 but he did favor him from a distance i look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen he didn't have john's charisma but he definitely has a charm about himself he has beautiful eyes and a great smile he reminds me of my boyfriend alot ms bissett was just too breathy for me she should have that asthma checked out im not going to comment on the darryl hannah character my mom always said if ya can't say anything nice then shut the hell up so that's what im gonna do br br molly
<START> okay for the most part and all its cheesiness this movie was actually pretty good for an mst3k flick but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending spoiler alert the film is very basic a rich mama's boy named danny meets a bum named and the two of them travel to a small town where meets a pretty girl named carrie who is so very now this film's basic premise seemed promising enough all they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie carrie loves loves carrie a creepy guy in town lusts for carrie now i know what you're thinking fights the creep and ultimately decides to settle down with carrie and danny returns home and they all live happily ever after right wrong because carrie gets murdered by the town creep because is too gay to commit there are so many homosexual undertones between danny and and then the whole town decides to lynch even though the town creep would've easily been the prime suspect then the town creep confesses to killing carrie without much hesitation must've felt bad the poor dope then danny brings home with him that's the film's happily ever after sad huh all i can say is thank god for joel and the bots because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite mst3k episodes
<START> i ticked the contains spoiler box in case i say anything that is a spoiler and don't realise i've said it until i re read it after i've posted so it's just in case br br anyhow back to reviewing this film br br i saw this film on earlier on this afternoon and by the description sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about 30 minutes into it i was appalled this film in my opinion has the worst scriptwriting and actors actresses ever the young girl who falls in love with the boy from l a after about 3 hours is a really stupid lame character who has an annoying whiney voice and hair then there's her lover who's an idiot and is also very whiney actually maybe they suit each other then there's the boy's mum who's with him on holiday and surprise surprise she's a doctor and oh my god wait there's even more unsuspected surprises a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses o shock horror yeah right lol then there's this insane religious lad who keeps going on about or something and how the lord knows all everyone on the island seems to love him yet he's actually a stubborn arrogant steroid pumped you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim his head is like tiny and his body is massive it's hilarious buffoon who's had way too much to drink br br anyhow after all these weirdo characters including a stoned looking taxi driver the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood sample and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that because for some reason he's dramatically been saved all down to and god and oh my god yes there's another surprise you'll never guess what just in the nick of time with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in fact including her son and his girl she finds the cure and injects everybody and it's all resolved what a pathetic film i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though it'd be good and have some sub plot twists somewhere but no no it was just boring and dry br br don't watch this film you'll end up like me stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back
<START> a delight from start to finish br br if you don't like the muppets then i just have to feel sorry for you this terrific film doesn't simply cash in on the muppets' popularity it's a well conceived and well written film in its own right it's got great songs and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in jim henson's creations and which is most personified in the character of kermit the frog i always responded to this as a kid and it's what makes the muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazy br br a huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie sized version of around the world in 80 days except that it's about 80 times better br br grade a
<START> victor buono as the devil surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made that's not the worst part of this silly mish mash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it while the film is by no means terrible it doesn't even approach other 1970's haunted house flicks like amityville horror the changeling and the legend of hell house the evil can be entertaining in spots but don't expect to be scared it's better approached as what it is a silly horror film made all the sillier by it's over serious approach
<START> young warriors 1983 br br while this is a deeply flawed and in some ways idiotic movie the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan br br meet yuppie college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies in what starts out as a particularly egregious teen sex comedy we follow this bunch of jerk offs and their antics which involve among other things making pledges tie bricks to their genitals the movie abruptly shifts gears when kevin's high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do when she dies in the hospital kevin vows revenge much to the chagrin of his detective father br br so far we've gone from porky's lite through last house on the left territory into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick however kevin and his gang's portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill crazed lunatics it's to the film's credit that it doesn't glamorize the fascist anti crime rhetoric that kevin continually spouts while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does br br the mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly and by the end it's so over the top and exploitative that it'll leave you incredulous and that's the strength of this film you never know what to expect next br br at over 100 minutes it's a little lengthy for this kind of fare but you won't get bored poorly acted for the most part with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue this won't be topping anyone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon i got a kick out of it though and i'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it
<START> i recommend idiocracy to everyone luke wilson is very funny the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times until the end when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr judge's vision of tomorrow br br keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials justin long as dr lexus i found his performance oscar worthy especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent past besides he's cute br br in short idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names the president's middle name is mountain dew hospital visits cost 5 billion dollars there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all and nobody cares about anything but money all because only stupid people are breeding sounds familiar to me somehow oh yeah it's what i think of when i see professional wrestling br br seriously watch this movie it's a good laugh and it will make you think
<START> although i am not a michael jackson fan i like some of his early songs and some from jackson 5 too 'thriller' is one of his great songs and it comes from the best selling album ever with the same title as for the video it is awesome one of michael's best but also very eccentric and weird br br there is a story behind this video but it's so complex that even i can't fully understand it it's freaky the freakiest things are jackson's transformation into a werewolf his evil red eyes at the end like a werewolf and those dead people dancing br br the video is very dark thrilling chilly and original there are great sceneries and settings the music itself is full of life and rhythm characteristic from the good old pop from the 80's br br i like vincent price's soliloquy he does a great narration with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter at the end is awesome my favorite videos of the 'king of pop' are billie jean and don't stop 'til you get enough both among his best songs
<START> a respectable royal rumble event br br 1 edge vs shawn michaels br br 7 5 10 a very strong opener heel performance was sublime as it was during the rumble event overall id say edges night br br 2 undertaker vs casket match br br 7 10 a lot of people hated this rivalry though i liked it i thought really played his character well the match wasn't amazing in excitement that was until kane and get involved it gets better as it goes on br br 3 kurt angle vs big show vs jbl wwe champ wwe title match br br 7 5 10 a surprisingly good match as there was only 1 really exciting in ringer in it angle of course very good title match good pace though a predictable end but aren't all royal rumble title matches predictable br br 4 triple h world title vs randy orton world title match br br 6 5 10 actually not that good for the guys involved went on too many dry patches orton sold his concussion amazingly ending though was some what of an anti climax br br 5 royal rumble event btw during the other matches there were a few segments two which were really cool cena rapping on christian and guerrero stealing flairs number 30 entry ticket the event was good 7 10 would have got a 9 if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins though i understood why vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena crack up in laughter

<START> here's one of the more pleasingly scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse items it's a pervasively low rent pimp opus which comes across like a sleazier version of the mack john daniels the studly womanizing hairdresser hero mr jonathan in the immortal black shampoo gives an excellent steely portrayal of the baron a ruthless business savvy forever on the make all powerful flesh peddler who much to the dismay of his bitter brutal italian rivals reigns supreme over the sunset strip when not locking horns with his fellow no count criminal pals or doing his best to avoid being busted by the local vice cops daniels is leading a sweetly average existence as your standard garden variety suburbanite dude complete with caring wife and loving kids in some typically humdrum california small town br br the glaringly absurd premise alone promises top rate trashy greatness of a decidedly grade b schlock picture variety george deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script matt commendably tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junky goods by the slimy bucketful thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid grime among the assorted squalid delights to be savored herein are plentiful gratuitous female nudity coarse dialogue beautifully gaudy me decade threads halter tops felt hats sparkling day glo jewelry loud suits an intensely funky r b score by smoke some hopelessly pathetic acting the little old lady who lives next door to daniels is excruciatingly shrill a memorably nasty turn by patrick wright as a sadistic goon a couple of cool action set pieces the climactic slow motion barroom massacre seriously cooks more lurid travelogue footage of the sunset strip than you can shake a feather boa at said footage allegedly includes the actual hookers and blades of the sunset strip in hollywood effectively cinematography by ken a few sicko sexual fetish tableaux some raw explicit violence a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off and amusing supporting performances by familiar schlock feature richard kennedy and george buck flower as a pair of racist corrupt browbeating police detectives sure this movie ain't art but it's certainly artless enough to qualify as a deliciously grungy chunk of entertainingly sordid cinematic swill
<START> in my opinion the movie was laughable bad dialogue whoever wrote the script please keep your day job it's definitely no godfather or goodfellas it's good to be on the of the table poor choice of words some of the characters were clowns but what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors
<START> this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman the problem is that he is gay in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control br br this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times sally acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly the plot is outstanding as well i find the plot very realistic and i can completely identify with feeling of being terrified worried and upset on the other hand boyfriend jack is given much less attention in the film i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film and have more character development however as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film the love between jimi and jack was not developed in the film br br it is great to watch a gay affirmative film furthermore this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference be it sexuality culture and the way of life this film makes viewers think hard br br we need films like this to give us a boost thanks for making this film
<START> not for those adrenaline maniacs etc it's a good movie looking at after war psychical problem from the other point of view br br emilio estevez is great as a young man haunted by the demons of vietnam war causing problem in family br br marin sheen is also good as a conservative father br br it all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past with whom br br character can't seem to deal and martin sheen's character don't want do deal with br br protective mother looks at this problem with warm and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons
