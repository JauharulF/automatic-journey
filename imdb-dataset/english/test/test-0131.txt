<START> forget jimmy stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead i suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and stanwyck's other great christmas story meet john doe aren't revered with the same level of love as well you know it's name br br stanwyck plays a food writer for a type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes she's an ace b s artist until the day morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat 6 weeks in a navy hospital released the last year of wwii the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it's love at first sight unfortunately she has to play married to gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in ct just to fool her boss br br s z adds a great deal of hungarian double entendre humor in support as babs' true source of culinary talent una o'connor is hilarious as gardiner's obnoxious irish housekeeper
<START> i stumbled on to this site while looking for a video or dvd of the 1959 version and bess with sammy davis as life if anyone finds this on a home movie format please let me know i talk to my daughters all the time about things that they think are new which actually have already been done we went to see a live theater of version a couple of years ago and all i could talk about was this film sadly my daughters cannot remember seeing sammy davis jr in any production although they have heard of him needless to say they're not familiar with the other great actors in the film it is a major oversight not to have this classic film because of the cast on a home movie format for collectors and for future generations anyway in my opinion this version was the best
<START> this is a poor excuse for a movie a film noir done by berkeley please first let's forget about the plot a truly simple minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde so what turns her from despising him to loving him along with a group of other guys he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is off them it isn't exactly heroics but she's suddenly smitten it's truly painful to watch claude rains trying to portray a hard bitten tough talking noir type cop a crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool along with a growling voice most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles how he ever got talked into taking this job i'll never understand enjoy it if you can for a few period details the old cars and gas pumps but don't expect a decent film experience it wasted 1 1 12 hours of my life
<START> julien hernandez is certainly an attractive and likable on screen persona in fact his character pretty much carries this whole film or what's worthwhile about it the problem is with the exception of his gal pal played by marisa and paul as a trick date boyfriend for some of the characters no one else even comes close hernandez plays a 30 something director of cuban heritage and unknown sexuality who comes to l a and gets a job making a gay documentary in the process of meeting a group of gay people while finding subjects he comes out but very s l o w l y even at 88 minutes the film has obviously been stretched out and padded with various film school devices most of which only end up pointlessly interrupting the narrative which ain't much to begin with or pointing out the overall amateurish ness of the film making br br which is a shame because there's a love story in here somewhere and the final three minutes when hernandez's sebastien finally clicks with a wealthy west hollywood party thrower nicely underplayed by lonnie henderson and they share some sexy soulful kisses it works despite all that came before but we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations why would handsome dante have a eurotrash for a boyfriend he wouldn't and don't even get me started on friend paulie's rules for dating no gay man i know hell no sane person period would put such constrictions on himself or others and please tell me how sebastien gets a peeled banana which is normally fairly right stuck up his butt and has to go to a doctor to get it removed br br i noticed hernandez won an award for this film as a short it probably should have stayed that way all this said i'd look forward to seeing hernandez on screen again in a better scripted comedy with more assured direction
<START> now i am not prone to much emotion but i cried seeing this movie it certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups but there is something here for everyone the classic song it's so hard to say goodbye really makes this one worth watching at least once
<START> some people think of sweden in a negative way too neat too clean too serious too organized and too northern a people tortured by their own religious fate and history sometimes leading to depression and compulsive heavy handedness this need not be a problem for a filmmaker as for example the late bergman has shown us what can be cinematic possible under these conditions bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such br br however does the reverse he comments only on this identity hereby dissecting his people to the bone in his world sweden is equivalent for hell on earth but he does not take this any further and for me this is just not art but merely despite the exceptional amount of time it took to make this filmmaker has serious limitations he clearly cannot step out of br br compared to his previous movie andra songs from the second floor there is also not much progress to be observed the intention was that this was more accessible but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience aren't the best in the movie the same absurdism and minimalism also still apply there is the one shot camera position and the lack of action in front of this shot yes the stills are well done some of the scenes actually work and the coloring and positioning is amazing but does that make an interesting movie thinking in a negative way this is cinema taken a step backwards br br background as a maker of commercials shines through in the elaborate setup but i find his movies about as empty as those commercials there is a message about mankind but it is trivial and without much depth
<START> if you've ever heard the saying the book is always better than the movie heart of darkness is no exception to the rule i believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because i read the book aloud with my english class we discussed each paragraph in great detail so i grasped the concept pretty quickly i couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie this may be because there were no discussions held in class but i suppose it is also because i couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel if you're the type of person who believes in that well known saying then leave watching the heart of darkness movie off your to do list
<START> as we are well aware movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation i wish the director and or the screen writer had done his her research in this topic all this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a rift that should not be there this movie portrayed the sikhs and muslims in a very negative manor while making the third group hindus look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations the inaccuracies coupled with the sear disregard for one's faith as portrayed by was a disgrace to the highest format though on a more positive note the actors did a great job in acting in their roles both kristen k and neve c played their rolls exceptionally i hope those that watch this movie do not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event
<START> you know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you i'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator either way this is pretty much the purgatory between boring french professionalism and the heavenly campy joe d'amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot don't get me wrong there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one but there's always room for more laura gemser stars and that's good because she's hot it's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure but she still rules over her white counterpart you can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of often every reason is good every person is good every location is good one scene even involves an entire hockey team whatever they are doing in africa sometimes the plot gets in the way and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people but there's enough laura gemser for all
<START> very tightly written acted and filmed violent but not too much so whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray there isn't a wasted scene in this movie the usual suspects was superb ensemble acting this is a collection of outstanding individual performances i rarely buy movies but this one is worth owning
<START> this movie was really bad i mean really really bad the scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot and it was filmed in 2003 i think this was a great waste of time and money and michael shanks with his from scooby doo' image just made me laugh never waste your time with this picture i really don't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them the cat women' fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene i think this is a beautiful example of bottom 100 picture
<START> red skelton plays a radio detective known as the fox in whistling in the dark also starring ann rutherford conrad veidt eve arden virgina grey and rags ragland wally benton aka the fox finds his plans to marry his fiancÃ© carol rutherford thwarted when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult veidt joseph jones veidt has just learned that his cult the silver haven is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew who is going to be living off of the interest he wants wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney for backup and because he's not sure which one is wally's fiancÃ© jones kidnaps carol and also the radio daughter grey br br this to me anyway is a superior film to the second entry in this series whistling in dixie the plot is better the cast is better there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes skelton when he's not making faces and rolling his eyes is quite amiable and rutherford is very good veidt always played these evil men to perfection eve arden is wally's agent who arranges a date for him and grey to make sure his contract is renewed i had only seen grey in films from the 1950s onward she was always a good looking woman but who knew she was such a knockout in the '30s and '40s this is a fun film with a neat cast
<START> oh god book ii is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it it is not all that funny its plot plays too much br br like a rejected situation comedy pilot and the use of the slogan think god is a different variation on the idea that worked so much better in the original john denver had not returned for this movie and that made a big difference george burns as br br wonderful as he was playing god does not have the same chemistry with the little girl that he did with john denver br br i would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10 but only for br br george burns the rest of the cast is nothing special br br if you loved the first one don't bother to see this one
<START> jack lemmon and walter matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together they have made lots of movies together i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch i give the movie 10 out of 10 jack lemmon and walter matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv they will be sadly missed god bless you both
<START> i don't know but the movie was just too similar to other movies i've seen the ring the eye dark water they're all the same to me don't get me wrong it's beautifully made lovely camera work great graphics but that story is just too too common in the end it's the score that makes the suspense you know the screams rumbles the characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally moving very slowly surprised by anything they see i know some people that love this kind of film and if you do being a well made movie i guess it doesn't hurt to watch it but if you've seen the movie i've mentioned above and didn't like them then i'd suggest you don't bother
