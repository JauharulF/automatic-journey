<START> had clearly not seen the film in decades and his memory is appalling his attempts to paint the mark lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy sneaking peeks at the kid's body lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room and the man barely gives him a glance br br the scene is a crude attempt to show lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body br br like everything in this film it's badly done but nothing more br br even comments about character who casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff is nonsense it was a single woman she was already dead and she was in a car br br i suggest that review says far far more about his own far from liberal mindset than it does about this valueless film br br the only reason i even bothered to look it up was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after kojak br br the film is a worthless piece of 70's trash but review of it is the worst kind of slander he wraps up his review in pseudo intellectual facts but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every factual matter he discusses br br i can only assume that saw exactly what he looked for which is disturbing now he can return to burning copies of catcher in the rye
<START> this was my second experience of the monkey island series the full seven years after i had been shown the first game what was my response oh great we're playing a cartoon i'm glad my brother shut me up then and played on because the jokes caught my attention once again as well as wonderful voice acting of not to mention everyone else done well i still think elaine sounds better than the cutscenes do well to illustrate something happening and the art of both the game and cutscenes are excellent when we found the cd with the originals secret and revenge we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through revenge one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it however has to be the monkey island game i've played the most especially for the return of and combat on the high seas that moment when you encounter kenny and he tells you he's gone straight and then i'm running guns had both my brother and i in tears from laughter and that's not the best part of the game not by far
<START> i would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many many many many scenes of lucas the young protagonist walking and looking at things yep and you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless meaningless and pretty much ignored for the rest of the film br br this movie is populated by dull people who do dull things and the dullest person of them all is young lucas who is going blind and needs an operation you see he has delusions terrible delusions he thinks a killer is preying on blind women he walks around a lot and acts like an insufferable jerk br br patience does not pay off with this film by the end the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic and it is very hard to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant nothing is made clear the film moves at a snail's pace and it left me with the same effects of a hangover br br judging from afraid of the dark the british don't make stupid thrillers like the americans do they make boring ones
<START> this is one of the best tv movies i have ever seen the title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on all tv movies are like that br br the story is fantastic it may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story gary cole plays a military man named dave who feels trapped in his marriage he abandons his wife and kids and then fakes his death all so he could be with alyson karen how far will dave go to keep his secret br br the acting is top notch for tv movies gary cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming smooth talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious karen does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a liar and doesn't know what to do about it teddi who i believe is gary cole's wife in real life plays her part well especially when she cries about the death of her husband wendy adds a nice touch as alyson's sister linda is great in her small role as dave's mother br br predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several notches
<START> having finally caught up with this masterpiece it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever in its day it's french arty under played to the point of agony and ultimately downbeat but viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future it's also just a bit vacuous pretentious and unsatisfying br br others have summarized the story but i don't think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film the lead characters corey and vogel really don't deserve what they get they play square within their code never harm anyone who didn't ask for it and show great courage and initiative moreover corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland ' who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed apparently just because he corey dared to 'borrow' a few thousand francs these are guys who really ought to be due for a break instead things go far worse for them than they really need to within the logic of the story br br one might contend that this is the whole point that the real villains never get caught that they collude with the police as needed sell out their friends and always come out on top but that's not shown either corey's old gangster friend is not shown with the police nor is he shown gloating over his victory in fact after materializing several times when he's needed he's nowhere to be seen at the conclusion leaving a dramatic tension his feud with corey entirely unresolved br br nonetheless i'd say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography its slow deliberate pacing its great deadpan performances its elaborate heist sequence and its encapsulation of the art film style of the late 1960s
<START> bullets may not have bounced off his chest but the lone ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other boyhood hero superman he represented truth justice and the american way in a classic tv western setting living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill while scouring the american southwest with his faithful indian companion tonto to bring every single outlaw to justice the advent of tv provided the perfect opportunity for a post war generation to find it's ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years br br today i had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story for fans of the ranger this is the grand daddy of all western sagas telling as it does how texas ranger john reid survived the ambush by the butch gang and how he was nursed back to health by an indian friend from his childhood tonto jay declares his companion a and names him sabe i've read various interpretations of the origin of the term sabe but i'm satisfied with explanation reading too much into it just detracts from the story just like the english translation of from spanish which i won't reveal because it's just better not to know if you can help it br br i thought it quite clever how the origin story created the mystique of the lone ranger like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the rangers died in the box canyon ambush you never see the face of the man who becomes the lone ranger as it's always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly the voice of the story's narrator describing the wild sterling qualities would that relate say to sterling silver i got the biggest kick out of that br br of course with the passage of time watching the lone ranger episodes today offers a view of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the origin story some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy particularly when it comes to a lone ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of it's owner's hand and how about that little wave he gives to tonto whenever they're about to ambush the bad guys it's always the same gesture but tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances then you have the episodes where clayton moore takes off the ranger mask to don a different disguise to impersonate another character in service to the story he even went under cover once as an actor portraying president abraham lincoln to uncover a villain top hat and all br br few fans that i come across ever know that actor john hart replaced clayton moore for the 1952 53 season in a contract dispute that moore had with the show's producers if you ever saw that happy days episode where fonzie idolizes his boyhood hero you'll notice it was john hart listed in the credits it's difficult actually to tell if you're watching a hart episode or not the key is to listen to the voice moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead giveaway br br if you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes you're in for a treat the renditions i've seen on vhs are absolutely gorgeous although i don't know if commercial prints are available most of the black and white episodes around have been re packaged by any number of distributors in different so getting your hands on those should be no problem the must see of course is the three part origin and if you don't watch anything else this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the west's most famous heroes hi yo silver
<START> first of all you should watch this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles pornography kinky sex and utter horrifying and truly shocking depravity i mentioned kinky sex but to call sex in the second half of the movie kinky would be a great understatement it's more like a punch in the face if you aren't prepared for this sort of sickness that being said i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese br br the plot seems to be fairly basic almost nonexistent a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie don't expect much in first 30 40 minutes there is some dialog if you don't speak japanese it's not going to mean much to you that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew performer then there is some porn straight sex and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break and then it starts to happen br br it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene this time tied with the rope the abuse begins whipping slapping hot wax in the end girl breaks down and cries they untie her br br then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened except for the girl she is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave she walks to the door sits on the floor to put her shoes on and that's when hell breaks loose br br she is hit in the head with the baseball bat her wound is treated she is tied to the bed what ensues can be briefly described i'm not going to spoil everything for you as rape during dismemberment think of flower of flesh and blood mix it with porn and you will get the idea it goes on for about 20 minutes or so sfx are very good makeup too everything is shown with no mercy for the viewer you have been warned br br i thought visitor q was a very sick movie after watching it looked like a fairytale to me this movie is so sick so depraved so twisted so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale too bad it's released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available but the movie still works without them so if you are into ultra sickness extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre check this out i hope you won't have nightmares 8 10
<START> a serial killer carl has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell he is apprehended by the fbi but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water br br take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it the magic of mark script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting if i mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of then sets up a different film entirely br br this wouldn 't be enough to make the cell a different class of thriller but director singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller the cinematography by paul where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but singh doesn't let it end there things like costume design where wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller br br what stops the cell becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative we see a third character a fbi man enter domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing moments br br it should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable then involving one scene where a fbi agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button you'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one
<START> a great movie about triumph over all the nay sayers who try to kill your spirit achieving the impossible i won't go on about it other than to say that i liked to reflect on the this film when i'm facing something particularly daunting and realize that if lindberg could do what he did i can certainly face the task before me definitely a feel good movie br br see it you won't be disappointed
<START> what's his name what clear br br that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was released br br i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue br br madonna plays nikki finn a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit when she gets out she decides to seek revenge br br griffin dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his fiancÃ©e's father john the future father in law asks to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications aplenty some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way br br madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only 8 10 but on the other hand i can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice br br this film shows madonna's comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancÃ©e br br yes it's predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more
<START> i vaguely remember this film i do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that i have ever walked out on and since then i have never seen it available to rent anywhere i can't spoil it for anyone cos i can barely remember it to think looking at the cast it seemed a winner with john landis directing but good god they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel all i can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer i walked out after about half an hour of this i must confess though i'd love to see if i can get a copy just to see if it really was that bad br br it wouldn't surprise me if this was on every actor's black list i mean christopher lee was in this the legend of all bad guys who'd been in star wars and lord of the rings as i said black listed movie the
<START> itÂ´s all my fault they all told me i should avoid seeing this movie because iÂ´m a huge fan of the old tv series they were right while production values are good and the actors themselves including donÂ´t look now julie christie that bad the whole film displays a and self conciousness that clearly is without any justification a comparison between the karloff mummy and the mummy returns 2000 comes to my mind in fact 2000 owes much more to the new mummy films than to the old series but then scripting is terrible speed there is none and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes the first scene in the tomb looks plain stupid with cats clearly being thrown when theyÂ´re supposed to jump landing with their first moves around like a statue on wheels neither impressive nor scary and the psychological drama that unfolded in the old tv series when the heroine had to learn that sheÂ´s a villain is completely neglected this movie is so wasted wasted money wasted actors wasted blueprint that it hurts itÂ´s a below par mummy rip off thatÂ´s only good for some laughs but has nothing at all to do with the greco classic she has a small role in this movie too on the graveyard
<START> i go this game and it is alright i guess i just expected a bit more the main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard even if you read the instructions you can't get it also the graphics aren't as good as pandora tomorrow and double agent this game could do with some improvements it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens in my opinion this is the worst out of the three i haven't played the first one but have played pandora tomorrow this and double agent this game deserves a 4 10 though could do with some improvements
<START> in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper br br the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people won't really pay to see either the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air time br br the first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch r rated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
<START> the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie the girls were lame and pathetic i mean how can they own their own clothing line dolls movies producing studios and not smell this bomb from far away in order to gain some sort of responsibility which i dont really see the sense in the punishment they are sent to paris far far far away from home to live with the so called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris i cant really remember what he was so who really cares the detail doesnt help the girls are sent to paris to learn something so what exactly do they learn when they meet two french boys and are able to manipulate the guy that supposed to watch them so they can meet these guys on scooters the typical pre teen movie having all pre teens wishing to and be able to afford the trip to paris or some far away country away from parents i dont really like the anyways they never could really shake off the image of michelle on full house in case you didnt see that then you were lucky from the start f f
