<START> the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the then husband wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers she has and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer he's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this wood's jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed no matter what and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick she sings it for four or five or six minutes so you know it's classic padding between commercials it also is one of the worst songs ever written and the woman doing wood's singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery also keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses by comparison wagner looks relatively timeless with close cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits
<START> kk should stick to singing this whole movie was a big bore i can't understand the viciousness of the boys and the romance between miles and kk the sex scenes were uninspired too the ending was awful unresolved there needs to be reason to murder and the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird the mother always wrestled with the boy don't you think he would get some rather freudian with her and why didn't someone teach kk how to speak with inflection instead of monotone br br glad i only paid 1 00 to rent this br br
<START> i hope this group of film makers never re unites
<START> what can i say after i say the one line summary sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it can't save it way too much pre occupation with guns how can the hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns it's just worse than expected
<START> the movie that would be included if mystery science theater 3000 had a home game version the source material for tacky comments in this movie are endless i found the video of terror in the jungle at a garage sale what a find
<START> iÂ´ve been able to see this great movie at the fantasyfilmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down g iÂ´ve really seen lots of movies and there are just a few iÂ´d call perfect like fight club or koyaanisqatsi subconscious cruelty is now one of them half of the people watching it in berlin went out of the room and i can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his her perfect world day by day dreaming his her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet in our life i donÂ´t think i have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page itÂ´s a movie that shows everything and more gets 10 points from 10 itÂ´d be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e mail so far i havenÂ´t met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as i am finally sorry for my bad english iÂ´m not a studied person und das ist gut so
<START> i'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention the script is sub standard it's easy to see why vidal tried to disown it the direction is worse most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un erotic porn more prevalent obviously in the uncut version the cinematography is especially sub par giving the whole production a cheap washed out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs the movie should've looked a whole lot better the overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an x rated movie called it wears thin after the first hour after peter o'toole and john guilgud exit bob obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid bbc production of i claudius instead and if you want porn louise look somewhere else
<START> to be honest the movie was so horrible that i loved it never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie i was in shock i mean i don't even know what to say br br the characters couldn't even keep their own guns one minute a guy had an and his friend had an mp5 then in the next scene they switched guns don't ask trust me i know my guns and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam to an arizona highway to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in california that is what i took from it br br why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you how is that frightening i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie i love how the skeleton man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day but hey whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants br br good day
<START> i haven't seen this film since it came out in the mid 70s but i do recall it as being a very realistic portrayal of the music business right up there with paul simons one trick pony another vastly underrated film imo br br harvey keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in and the commercial tripe the record company suits want him to work with br br since i spent my entire career in the music business as a composer arranger producer i can really vouch for the verisimilitude this film possesses br br if it should ever come out on dvd uncut i'd buy it
<START> this movie sucks did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else this movie blows hard painful to sit through too stay far away
<START> how many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime well i'll go out on a limb and say one this movie is better watched late at night with a 12 pack of beer the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogue br br on a pacific island a young man is sentenced to death for with the evil americans seems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the can be king well he vows to come back and wreak revenge br br before you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the american scientists' hut screaming come br br it seems the young corpse has done just that as the walking tree monster yes his revenge is terrible and so is this movie it seems that these natives cannot run from a lumbering tree so he tosses them in quicksand rolls them down hills etc pretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsaw br br general problems with this movie are numerous the comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a cockney accent like this movie needs comedy you want her to die upon her first appearance the leading lady is whiny the leading man is a boor the acting is wooden pun intended the dialogue is stiff and lumbering the natives have brooklyn accents the monster suit is pure giggles br br while this is a bad movie it still is fun to watch it gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone your dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree wasn't mobile
<START> three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller it's closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidman's grieving parents attempting to re define their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zane's adrift psycho killer it provided sharp increasingly suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded br br three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over inflated by some sort of life raft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoo manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse pun br br plus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credible br br i'm guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is it's not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema
<START> christian propaganda lots of fear mongering br br this is not scifi this is christian fiction the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn from then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil the ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible br br the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the christians to heaven no reason to repent if its aliens the deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose
<START> is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after um death spanish director ignacio a soul mate of his german colleague jÃ¶rg buttgereit provides blow by blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables scalpels surgical saws human entrails and warped minds br br welcome to the autopsy room br br i don't know which facets of the film apart of its notorious reputation may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating br br storywise it's fairly simple and straightforward a day in the life actually half an hour of a troubled coroner or perhaps assistant pathologist or whoever he is that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non traditional fashion right at his workplace i'm perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one note plot i suspect it may be somehow inspired by udo character's quirky demeanor in andy warhol's frankenstein br br artistic values of the film are also questionable it's hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don't squeeze a single word their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks there's also not enough room for great camera work basically the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls br br authenticity effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible but only a handful of medical forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here if anyone cares honestly i used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death now i know that dead bodies are severed raped and humiliated intestines are ripped apart brains are retrieved from the head stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts then the body is stitched back and washed nothing personal and what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward br br shock and disgust factor it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover to his horror that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection this obscure item is barely available sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film they are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see br br is really gifted and stylish director which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his trilogy preceding 'the awakening' amazing black and white short and 30 minute visually stunning and moody piece with an off beat and interesting concept and i'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new more mainstream oriented material and sooner or later would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his early warm up works br br but in the meantime i'm afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations
<START> the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9 11 socio political landscape maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a they deserve it's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again they've clearly shown they have no sense of character br br what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism execution and murder self defense and patriotism his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create sound like any belligerent retarded yale cheerleaders you know of br br blows the slovenly off the screen as sympathetic as plight is it's comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine
