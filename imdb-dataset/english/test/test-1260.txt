<START> i love sci fi and am willing to put up with a lot sci fi movies tv are usually underfunded under appreciated and misunderstood i tried to like this i really did but it is to good tv sci fi as babylon 5 is to star trek the original silly prosthetics cheap cardboard sets stilted dialogues cg that doesn't match the background and painfully one dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci fi' setting i'm sure there are those of you out there who think babylon 5 is good sci fi tv it's not it's clichÃ©d and uninspiring while us viewers might like emotion and character development sci fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously cf star trek it may treat important issues yet not as a serious philosophy it's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of life their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch the makers of earth know it's rubbish as they have to always say gene roddenberry's earth otherwise people would not continue watching roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull cheap poorly edited watching it without advert breaks really brings this home trudging of a show lumbers into space spoiler so kill off a main character and then bring him back as another actor dallas all over again
<START> oz was a fantastic show as long as frequent male nudity doesn't turn you off there was way too much frontal male nudity in this show more than any other show you'd see on a porn channel minus that it was the best show on tv and a previous commenter said better than prime suspect prime suspect is tom and jerry vs the simpsons no contest if you have directv they are now re running it from the start on channel 101 they're at episode 3 now highly recommended the creator tom fontana also did homicide which was an awesome show but why all the male nudity we all know that stuff happens in prison but did they really need to show it as often that was the only thing that turned me off the show if i want to see naked men guys getting raped i'll kill someone myself and witness first hand otherwise i like my tv shows free of black penises every five minutes
<START> this movie although well shot and superbly acted was awful i felt as if i was watching a car accident sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head the plot leaves little to be desired was extremely disjointed and the ending was abysmal although it did fit the tone of the movie i was hoping for something to improve this movie i still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much it's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful awful story there's not much more to say about this movie save yourself the time and watch c span it'll be more uplifting
<START> i guess i was prepared after all the years of hearing about it first heard about it from siskel and ebert when they said divine ate excrement i had to look it up then a friend told me about it in 1991 she said also that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mom almost dumped her dad over it so by the time i caught pink flamingos on sundance today i was prepared for the most part br br i still couldn't help but be surprised by the anal close ups and the blowjob scene that said the only characters i sympathized with were edie and the egg man her crying scene early in the film though over something frivolous to normal people actually makes me sad though she sure wasn't pretty she had a cute voice i was happy for her and the egg man and they actually touched me br br on the other hand the acting in this poverty level production was not good and as for the script just how does john waters come up with this stuff well at least it's different
<START> mon oncle antoine observes the craggy face of a homespun community from various angles slowly taking its time through the beginning as it should until we emerge from shattered but banal hopes and expectations into swirling of dreams and a heart stopping revelation about the terrible enigma of mortality br br aimless pans and zooms across the snowy mountainside comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer this restless camera work is personified in a fringe character who is equally the drifter quitting his job at the coal mine and leaving his family to cut lumber then quitting again and returning to the stark humanity of his boy dead br br a fetching old woman cheats on her husband and a young boy dies old things become new and new things die throughout is the snowy whiteness as wonder stricken as the history of cinema
<START> there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after i saw it it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi and at the very worst an act of murder like most people when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult after seeing this i think that was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u s government through his eccentric actions sure there were lots of weapons at the branch compound but none of it was illegal it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site the clueless testimony of janet reno and the partisan defense of the attack on waco a defense led by a few of the committee democrats standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u s senator from ny charles i voted for the man when i lived in ny state i'm a democrat pretty left leaning too after seeing his actions on this committee i wish i could go back in time and vote for d'amato instead for anyone remotely interested in the government this is a very crucial film a must see i even think this should be shown in classes it's that important
<START> the love letter is one of my all time favorite books so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it was to become a movie but i liked it i found myself grinning through the entire movie i admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half i thought that capshaw and scott were perfect as helen and johnny just as i pictured them and the town and scenery were just right as well i recommend this film but don't expect too much just enjoy it

<START> john cusack stars as hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies believe it or not demi moore is his co star if you love the eighties grew up around that time or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh wait until you see the cartoons what a riot
<START> story of the creation of underdog and adventures battling simon bar sinister in a live action format first we have picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where simon bar sinister works he fights back when sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding sinister on the street runs afoul of riff raff another dog and gets picked up by jim belushi who was a guard at the lab belushi's son discovers that has all these powers and eventually becomes underdog who will once again battle sinister br br once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not for me the film half works and half doesn't the part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see the dog as a dog with his master some of the repartee is funny but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to sweet polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film its painfully dull and feels like it takes forever to get through it which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits is something you don't want to do br br the parts that are good are anything with simon bar sinister peter is a blast and anything where underdog goes into action some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it of course i could be wrong since the middle section is so dull but i think not since i do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable br br as a whole its probably as awful as some people have said but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts this is an okay cartoon to film adaption but wait for cable really
<START> campfire tales is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert the film begins with the classic hook story and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert they crash their car put out some flares and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire to pass the time they decide to start telling classic horror stories about terrorized honeymooners a girl who falls prey to an internet predator and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house as they tell the eerie tales each story becomes increasingly terrifying but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come br br in my opinion the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine frightening effects the first story was alright and the sequence near the end was a little creepy the second story built a lot of suspense more than either of the others did but it's unoriginal plot was it's downfall i remember watching this movie a long time ago when i was like eight years old on hbo and the third story scared the crap out of me although it's not scary to me now you'll probably recognize some of the cast here particularly amy smart from the opening hook interlude story and christine taylor as one of the main actresses in the film the twist ending was kinda interesting too i know i didn't see that coming i thought it was all cleverly pieced together br br to sum things up if you're looking for a horror movie that is worth the while rent this you should be happy it's a great anthology of some classic urban legends and the whole film was tied together neatly it is much better than what one would expect 7 10
<START> super troopers was an instant classic club dread while disappointing to many had its moments puddle has fewer moments i saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the broken lizard group who made super troopers so naturally i picked it up i only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny a far cry from super troopers all in all i was very disappointed i would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time however you're better off playing video games or watching something that might make you laugh or think
<START> son gets severely wounded during a lion hunt that goes awry hercules a solid and engaging performance by the beefy reg park has to venture into an eerie and dangerous alternate dimension ruled by the evil and vengeful gia the earth goddess a deliciously wicked portrayal by gia and battle various monsters in order to save his son's soul meanwhile equally nasty son a perfectly hateful turn by giovanni poses as hercules and takes over an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant director relates the engrossing story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout this film begins a little slow but really starts cooking once hercules enters the misty and perilous subterranean spirit world rousing highlights include hercules grappling with a humanoid lizard beast hercules climbing a giant gnarled tree and hercules being attacked by a bunch of creepy rotting zombies better still the bizarre spirit world just reeks of spooky atmosphere gotta love that persistent thick swirling fog the strenuous rough'n'tumble mano a mano major physical confrontation between hercules and likewise totally rocks of course we also get a big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well mancori's crisp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressively expansive sense of scope ugo robust rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it okay so this flick is an obvious cheapo job that uses copious footage from both hercules in the haunted world and hercules and the captive women but it's still an extremely lively and entertaining romp all the same
<START> radio was a very good movie and honestly i never cry in movies but it had me pretty close to tears it really got to me when radio's mom died and he just wouldn't get out of his room i felt really sad about how if you were mentally retarded you wouldn't really be able to understand death i really liked the movie and it's a must see
