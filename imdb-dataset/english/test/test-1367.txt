<START> this british film version of the stage play i am a camera is based on christopher berlin stories this is the source material for the famous musical cabaret br br julie harris a major stage actress of her day reprises her 1951 tony award winning role as sally bowles she's a far cry from the liza minnelli character but the basic sally is all here despite the various film codes that would have blocked this story from being filmed in hollywood harris is perhaps stagy but she's also quite good as the madcap and maddening sally her singing number is obviously dubbed by marlene dietrich no less although harris apparently sings for herself in other moments br br laurence harvey with the very ugly hair plays with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting shelley winters does little with the role of natalia marian winters won a supporting tony for the play and anton diffring is ok as fritz ron randell plays the clive but seems a tad loud lee seidl is funny as the landlady br br yet despite the overall staginess and cheap look harris takes center stage and she is amazing this film was released the same year as east of eden in which harris gives a glowing performance as comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent miss harris possesses these two characters couldn't be more unalike harris' sally preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh she also acts circles around the boring harvey br br without the music and with a familiar storyline many viewers may find little here to recommend this film but it's a great chance to see the great julie harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951
<START> the plot of the movie is pretty simple a viral outbreak turned the population into flesh eating zombies those who left became hunters br br well first of all this is not the worst zombie movie there is among the worst are zombiez and the infamous zombie lake br br in fact i think the idea for quick and the undead was very good just executed poorly considering the budget they had to work with this movie looks very good i wasn't bored at all while watching it special effects were solid although they did use cgi once fat zombie getting shot in the head but everything else gore guts was rather good acting is awful however our main guy looks like young clint eastwood other actors are not even worth mentioning as far as the plot goes they didn't work enough on the development of the story br br bad acting low budget good special effects idea for the movie br br overall this flick deserves 4 10 from me it's not as bad as people say imagine a zombie western then watch this movie
<START> ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie br br for years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want to see 'man with the screaming brain' with the title alone one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monsters br br the idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensues br br with the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan it's funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scary br br if you like the silly bruce campbell you'll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didn't like bruce campbell
<START> the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair bad taste in clothes bad posture bad jobs and on and on they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves however if they learn to eat broccoli they will be wealthy successful and attractive br br tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt if nutrition is really that important they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods if they really believed in their computer simulations i'd like to see them do a double blind test by finding some 40 year olds finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children and age progressing the kids' photos then compare to the real things hey that sounds like a project for discovery channel are you listening br br tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons
<START> after a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy chainsaw massacre feeling everything falls apart br br spoiler alert as soon as the two fbi officers start jabbing you know they are the real killers anyone who have seen enough of these fooled ya movies can figure this out br br this movie is with one thing in mind to depict brutal murders why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well will this be next for us movie goers the torture and abuse of children whats wrong with you people lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind
<START> combining the conventions of both western and gothic horror and often directed as if it were an art movie this is one of siegel and eastwood's best collaborations br br eastwood plays a yankee soldier who after being wounded during the civil war takes refuge in an isolated southern seminary for young women shut away from the world the women project their romantic fantasies on to him and he responds with callous male manipulation but jealousy and resentment raise their heads and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge and boy is the revenge brutal br br beautifully shot by bruce surtees and carefully paced the beguiled is a haunting elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of eastwood's own play misty for me and tightrope br br the film is a gripping depiction of a fierce battle of the sexes and oozes a dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality all the characters are ambiguous displaying traits of both good and evil leaving it up to us to choose whom we should root for br br don siegel left quite a legacy of fine films behind everything from of the body snatchers to dirty harry but though his early black and white pictures have aged well the majority of his colour films seem grainy dated and badly shot his gritty realism must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago but when viewed today i just don't think they've stood the test of time br br the beguiled however is in a different league mature ambiguous and starkly shot it's a shame it isn't more widely known while evolving technology and technique have rendered the majority of siegel's tough masculine action thrillers obsolete the beguiled still entrances audiences today due to it's surreal atmosphere and unique subject matter br br 8 5 10 better than the similarly themed black narcissus this is in my opinion siegel's best film part horror part drama part sexual odyssey the beguiled is a surprisingly arty film especially when considering that siegel viewed his films to be quote a large part of the film's artistry is due to clint eastwood who would from this point onwards make an effort to choose mature material
<START> i can't believe this movie only scores 7 4 this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcock's movies such as vertigo or marnie the only reason i can think of why the score is so low is that for the most part the man renounces violence and certainly won't get a diploma in sex and crime br br what it derives its tension from is not violence it's the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails today having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as mel gibson's ransom this seems normal but in the 1950s where family was all in contemporary america the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot br br and this tension still works for me today yeah these guys are selfish ignorant bastards disturbing in how they act it's a deal for them and they want to be good businessmen disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera br br what makes the movie great however are the creative aspects the kinky ideas of hitchcock the outrageously disturbing scene in the church which brings it to the viewer's attention how alone how abandoned the protagonists are nobody caring nobody helping the people in the church just going home the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals which stresses the somewhat oriental flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad last not least the role of music in this movie br br music is the key principle here as spoiler the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud tutti gong so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second bang and then of course doris day singing que sera which became more famous than the movie itself she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy br br all in all a classic
<START> this was so poor i had to turn it off in the end i have never watched such a pathetic film i love b movies and was looking forward to more of the same but was sadly disappointed br br this has the worst acting plot direction writing etc of anything i have ever seen in my life br br my advice to anyone thinking or watching buying renting don't go there
<START> i don't see the sense in going through so much trouble to make a movie like this and then throw the history book out the window there wasn't a single accurate detail in that movie other than the fact than died which i was grateful for at the end so i didn't have to watch any more movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about wwi aerial history br br i'll skip the obvious that they were flying in 1916 because the blue max did that too or that 209 squadron was flying se and will attack other parts for one thing they call the d iii an 'old at the beginning for another they have voss goring and wolff all in the only one who was in that was voss and he joined after died wasn't held to blame for death erwin who collided with had swerved to avoid a british plane that was chasing when received his head wound it was while attacking a fe 2d two seater and he did not crash into the trenches and have soldiers fight over him and no werner voss did not die that day he died september 28th in one of the most epic battles in wwi br br manfred was short not like the actor who towered over everyone else his brother lothar was never in either he joined the squadron when manfred was in charge of 11 br br there's so many other glaring errors in historical fact that i'll let them go except perhaps the worst one the death scene in the movie manfred is out maneuvered by brown and then shot down making a perfect landing brown got off one burst at while was chasing may and the facts amassed over the years overwhelmingly show that was killed by ground fire not by brown br br the only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves which were as good as 'the blue max' other than that i won't watch it again and i paid 30 for the tape
<START> boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and i'd go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250 i can actually understand why many would dislike it due to the subject matter i personally feel however as many do judging from the this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making br br the direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance there is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing the individual characters reach out and touch you given that this is a movie about the porn industry one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are the direction is among the best i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of films br br the film isn't about one particular personal individual's story it's about many it's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning and though the film is long i believe almost 3 hours you honestly don't even notice and when it ends you kind of don't want it to br br i'm not easy to impress meaning there aren't many movies i'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one beyond the multiple character study is the use of music in the film i have never in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie there was such flawlessness to it you know it's not something your gonna see everyday br br burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best i've ever seen him do and mark wahlberg is incredible i'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well i don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that but the person who really surprised me was heather who is absolutely fantastic in her role in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo towards the end br br again i'll echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody but i still think this was topnotch 10 of 10
<START> how his charter evolved as both man and ape was outstanding not to mention the scenery of the film christopher lambert was astonishing as lord of greystoke christopher is the soul to this masterpiece i became so with his performance i could feel my heart pounding the of the movie still moves me to this day his portrayal of john was oscar worthy as he should have been nominated for it
<START> this film seems well made and more efforts should be made to promote films by women that aside this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed if you've seen any of the promotional material you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is br br a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship when told how unfair to say the least that such a threat is tessa the purported protagonist suggests that life's not fair br br huh this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior which she initially denies as a motive all the while assuring him this isn't sex br br reverse the genders have the leads played by tracey gold and brian austin green and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like hostage to obsession there is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass behavior in this film br br props to kristen thomson for playing a border line psychotic manipulative ex to a t perhaps too well because there is no well adjusted person male or female who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine
<START> my blue heaven is boring the plot is insipid the characterizations and dialogue stink the musical numbers while occasionally staged in interesting ways are not only too often absurd but also lyrically trite painfully bright and emotionally hollow to the core the leads betty grable and dan dailey are attractive professionals however in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the and uncompelling material they fail david wayne and jane wyatt for all their demonstrated talent in other projects are more or less cyphers here br br there's really only one reason to watch my blue heaven one reason one star mitzi gaynor in her film debut her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes but so what her pert and promising screen personality her feline beauty and her exceptional charisma shine through gloriously and make these minutes the most watchable memorable and exciting moments in the entire film if you would value an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise then check out miss mitzi gaynor in my blue heaven br br incidentally i scorn and would urge you to avoid drew casper's manic obsessive compulsive dvd commentary for this film wordy digressive unduly fastidious frequently ill timed with what is playing on the screen and galloping throughout with an excess of nervous energy his comments are absolutely indigestible
<START> it wasn't until i saw sidney pollack in the picture that i ever connected him to this film this is his worst possible movie absolute dreck the dialog is wooden and unbelievable the plot is unbelievable br br kristen scott thomas is wasted in this movie there is nothing about her character that makes you even want to believe in this story br br harrison ford is like on valium there is no life in his eyes br br i blame sidney pollack for the failure of this movie the script is awful and he is too smart to not see that so it smacks of some kind of payoff whether of a studio obligation or something else but this is just bloody rotten
<START> let me say this about edward d wood jr he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood the world would probably be a much better place being familiar with ed wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic ed wood 1994 several times i admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved i still admire his never say die attitude he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern day hollywood had br br but that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch and glen or glenda his first and most confessional film is probably his very worst br br glen or glenda is a deadening cult movie about a cross dresser named glen played by director writer ed wood himself who despite his love for his fiancÃ©e barbara dolores fuller cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes glenda glen glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called the scientist played by veteran horror star bela lugosi oh and there's also some sub story about an alan anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the christine story upon whom this movie originally titled i changed my sex was previously to be based br br have i dropped your jaw yet well as much as i want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis i just gave you every thing in it is true this is a movie about cross dressers and transsexuals a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner i'm sure that with a good screenplay and a good director it had neither that glen or glenda despite the subject matter could have been a very moving picture it is a confessional movie on wood's part as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen but once again that does not make it a good movie or a watchable one for that matter glen or glenda is a jumbled disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema it makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where bela lugosi screams pull the string over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice reminding me of some very bad short informative films i've seen before it's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy minute feature and twice as dull we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens the only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film but personally i couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be i'll tell you what he was a gifted actor who wound up making trash but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other so good for him br br i will always admire edward d wood jr for his passion for the cinema but i will never as long as i live admire his movies a film critic once called ed wood's movies innocent fun but i think even that is questionable innocent yes fun no sir and if citizen kane is the mount everest of the cinematic world then glen or glenda is probably the mariana trench
