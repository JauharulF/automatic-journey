<START> this movie is a little slow in the the beginning for about the first 10 minutes or so but once it kicks in you can't turn it off adam beach and rose play the best parts and are great at their acting job you would never be able to guess who the killer is i gave this movie a 9 because at some parts adam beach needs to speak up a little so you can hear what he's saying br br 9 10
<START> this is easily the worst most offensive piece of crap on tv i'd love to completely ignore it but fox has stuck it into their sunday lineup forcing me to find something else to watch between american dad and family guy the dink head male star guy is just about the least evolved pathetic excuse for a human i have ever seen on tv nothing on the show is remotely funny and pretty much everything on it has been done already and much better by other shows br br it's obvious that their strategy is to ram it deep and hard into the sunday schedule and hope someone starts liking it but i have to break it to ya fox thats the wrong hole the scam not worked on me i simply look elsewhere but come on you freaking boneheads this show freaking sucks and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the fox sunday lineup br br they cancelled arrested development for this steaming pile
<START> most of the criticism of attack of show is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer tv program called the screen people are upset because g4 decided to cancel the screen and replace it with the pop culture based attack of the show to compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges br br attack of the show is a unique hour long program that covers current generation x y culture it features segments on movies television panel discussions video games new dvd releases sex advice new gadgets mp3 players cell phones etc comic books graphic novels magazines and internet fads br br it's a fun show definitely worth checking out you are in your 20s or 30s i give it an 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of my all time favourite films its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest i always throw on this film if i'm going on holiday or if i don't want to go to the gym just seeing gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy romance and an interesting plot you will love it it is filled with great characters and ben and nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing bottom line you have to give it a try i watched it on tv one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday my father the hero i love you
<START> and is an entertaining fast paced and refreshing film refreshing because unlike most other period films it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach indeed historical accuracy is all but ignored this film does not take itself too seriously and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten and is set in the 18th century yet director jake scott offers a thoroughly 90s take there's action sex and swearing aplenty and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dance to disco beats jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are brilliant as always and the rest of the cast especially alan cumming as a flirtatious fop are also highly entertaining the film is visually spectacular in places and is a mixture of comedy action and drama with a love interest provided by liv tyler with a shaky english accent in short if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours this is the film for you it won't make you think but it could well put a smile on your face
<START> make no mistake about high school is a bad movie br br high school is about a geek who makes a plan to become rich and get the girl however he goes about it all wrong and of course by the end of the movie ends up dead along with a few other people thankfully including the girl br br the moral of the story is all women care about is wealth also for us men i guess we're just supposed to accept we either have it or we don't have it br br i could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1 however it is above that of the very worst of movies the acting's not totally horrible and production values aren't ultra terrible over all it's a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons if you insist of course at torturing yourself watch the mst version br br 2 10 maybe a 1 5 10
<START> the other reviewers are way waaaay off as to why the farscape show has been temporarily put to rest it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows in fact the exact opposite is true they kept getting better and better i have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on and the wormhole subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe not less before it was sort of chaotic slow and rather aimless they spent like the first two seasons running from this foe type but in the second two they were actually trying to do something also i have never seen such a great fun blend of sexy gals and attitudes in sci fi the blue girl was cool but not they literally got to the point where the gals were running around in leather corsets and high heels blasting aliens now tell me what could be cooler than that br br the real reason farscape went off for a bit is because it was costing too much and that is a good thing for the fans because the show watched end to end is really like a 60 hour long epic movie with all the cinematics of the blockbuster stuff ok ok they do use similar sets a lot but the cg is great and the gals are br br blah blah the real reason is because tv shows are about profit it is a business and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big a return on this expensive farscape show as they could with junk shows like 'stargate' was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fat lipped oddity br br anyway yes remember this farscape kept getting better and better until it was really like a little real movie each week then the networks decided 'hey people will watch any old piece of drek we shove on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour so why are we spending all this money on farscape let's shove cheesy low budget 'stargate' down people's throats and call it a 'hit series' because it's like all we play every darn night lol br br that's the way it goes also i gotta tell ya that claudia black is a really cool actress after she got her facelift got the baggy eyes tightened she was looking really cool one of those dynamic types like judy davis and sometimes hot looking sometimes ugly like a roller coaster ride i'd par claudia black with lucy lawless in style and substance both very fun to watch not just and yeah you may say the pregnancy thing was cheesy but how many sci fi shows have a believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses it was legitimately cool as a romance story the actors on the show are great it really is a shame the show is in limbo for now but i hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well because i will deffinately buy them d
<START> i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box thanks go to ebay br br deleted on any format since 1990 this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted directed by stewart mac me the scenes of leaping tigers running through the alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing br br why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on dvd is a big wonder but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate br br if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp films of this calibre as shown don't come often br br a true masterpiece in every sense of the word and highly worthy of its praised comments when the north wind blows will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it
<START> if i ever write movies or make them i would want one of them to be like this one i enjoy the goof ball sense of humor and jokes contained within this movie does stupid things without looking like it the names of the places and characters are priceless generic new york high school squid george's sister etc genius i've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable tv staple while i was growing up of course i didn't get all of the jokes back than but it was still funny this movie is a time less classic
<START> how many of us have read a book or seen a play and then when the movie version came out we were terribly disappointed well maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the play too but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage i was extremely entertained by this movie the characters were funny the music was great and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters flaws and all jonathan silverman has such good comedic timing and his lines especially are hilarious i'm not going to give any spoilers it's just a nicely done funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle class family during wwii so if you never saw the play and if you have enjoyed other neil simon movies don't be held back by the couple of negative reviews seen here on its own brighton beach memoirs is a great movie i guarantee it no money back though
<START> this is a truly heartwarming film not just about love but about learning about yourself and your values in life though the story is a novel starting point for a film it is easily recognized by most people it combines a wicked sense of humor with a subtle assault on homophobia not to be missed
<START> i saw this movie in the early 70's when i was about 10 yrs old on tv it was on after school and as i watched i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two astronauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet that i asked my mom if i could get the cassette recorder out she let me so i wrapped the cord of the mic around the channel knob so the mic was hanging in front of the speaker this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to and cared enough about to record just the audio there were no vcrs at the time the plot will have you hanging onto every word every minute of this film the ending will blow your mind after watching the journey to the far side of the sun you will have flash backs in your mind about it for a long time i did replay the audio recording for many years and saw it over and over in my mind then maybe 15 years later when vcr's were common and they sold tapes in stores i always looked for it but never found it but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second so after about 30 years after seeing it for the first time i got to see it again wow it was spectacular just for reference i must have watched it 50 times since
<START> some major spoilers you've been warned br br i saw this movie yesterday at film festival and i must admit that being a fan it was really impressive excellent graphic excellent music excellent dubbing excellent action sequences and so on but there's a but all the film was thought exclusively for the gamers that have loved it and that can therefore enjoy every single reference character inside joke you should see a joke with winning music that's particularly comic etc a poor man not inside the world of ff will obviously see the magnificence of technical part but cannot grasp the inner satisfaction of seeing e g barret appearing and shooting totally out of nowhere he'll ask himself who's this guy and i cannot blame him he cannot even understand what a gamer feels when in the opening sequence there's game's opening music running in the canyon with his two cubs howling at ruins and then 498 years ago almost all characters have made an appearance or quote including reeve and elena and reno rude were really goofy and comic to see but the final impression the movie left to me was hardcore final dream but far less for a movie fan
<START> all dogs go to heaven was a quirky funny movie with good name talent who's voices an adult familiarity to a cartoon basicly for kids it was just interesting enough to be likeable by adults aside from something good for the kids to watch br br unfortunately is a valueless sequel trying to make a bit of cash on the coattails of the first charlie sheen is a passable replacement for burt reynolds in this second movie and sheena voice in a few of the movies lovely but forgettable songs makes her a worthwhile pick as a co star for this add dom deluise from the first movie and you'd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one br br unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as bebe in the horrible role of this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills or lack thereof present all over this movie horrible editing of the voices and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been br br all in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large pass
<START> despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer br br by the way what has become of ms driver she had such a potential in the film industry br br this to me was almost like an 1850s version of yentl without the musical fanfare with the death of her father driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family hiding her jewish identity br br while i realize that this is a period peace it was awfully dull even for 1850 england and scotland br br the lady of the house is most irritating with that sing song voice of hers i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment what kind of name is mary i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian but does this name signify all the way br br in the interim mary finds love with the young father wilkinson and his emotionally unbalanced son br br in the end the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her family photography did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film br br the early scenes of judaism practiced in 19th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more there is a definite underlying feeling of anti semitism by the wilkinson family but that's never allowed to come out
