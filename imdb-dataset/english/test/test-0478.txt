<START> this film is in a dead tie with the original for worst film ever made i think this one may be slightly worse if anything spoiler alert here are these survivors on a ship that's been for a long time improbable no impossible the whole premise is so laughable as to not be funny there are some pretty big names in the film and even they couldn't save this sorry thing i find it truly a waste of good celluloid after seeing this i also unfortunately decided that it had been a waste of my time don't bother with this one or the original for that matter i gave it a 2 mainly because they throw votes of 1 out
<START> the incomparable paul naschy horror film icon of spain lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride br br paul naschy plays a cold hearted hit man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters one of which is his flame who is carrying his child to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman when the deed is done the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts his girlfriend whose brother paul killed vows revenge and chases paul through the forest shooting him up and leaving him for dead however paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate br br at the estate the two daughters silvia and hernandez fight for paul in his weakened state with the busty silvia determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim but things get hairy for mr naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate grounds couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides br br story the story goes a number of ways and doesn't fully satisfy the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia whose character seems assertive and volatile simply lets win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight personally i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman br br violence you get gunplay a blown up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick br br acting paul naschy as always is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds starring with him again are the luscious silvia and the beautiful hernandez who teamed with mr naschy in the little gem the craving both girls do a fine job br br nudity you get very brief glimpses of both and hernandez but they are strategically placed keeping the naught bits covered full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and
<START> no offense to anyone who saw this and liked it but i hated it it dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot also too simple and the acting was so so br br i would give this snorefest a 2 at the most
<START> excuse me cuba gooding jr should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film he was the film while the film may be lacking in some areas cuba was awesome and for me this is the best role that he has ever played the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up what a tragedy getting to see the real radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears you need a heart check if you liked simon birch and the mighty you'll love radio too i wish they made more movies like this radio is the real deal
<START> a team of amateur journalists and tree huggers catches wind of a secret government project project on a remote south pacific island the scientists there are producing giant sized corn but the genes are spreading to other species creating abnormally large komodo dragons and a cobra one that's bullet proof and swims underwater with the help of the scientist's daughter can they escape the island and tell the world even if i hadn't seen this film on the sci fi channel which sadly i did it would scream sci fi channel with its low production value weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history the effects here are comparable to another creature film raptor island although not nearly as bad i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films but i haven't bothered to confirm that and probably won't it will be a sad day when i see either of them films again br br which is not to say it's not enjoyable i watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and i can't speak for him but i thought it was a pretty good use of time as bad the whole thing is it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the film i believe the actress' name is michelle michael pare also appears as a ship captain and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on furnace look respectable even if that movie is intolerably bad br br i can't be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be bad effects low budget no name actors i didn't have any higher hopes yet this doesn't mean that it's awesome either coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department for the one fan who likes this film and calls it hold on to your copy because you'll have a heck of a time getting a replacement
<START> a wonderful story so beautiful told so intense so whit no keyboard to describe i think go see it feel it it a story about love romance war and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it if you don't love romance drama well skip it that's all i can i vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful
<START> predictable cliche unbelievable boring what else can i say it's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess oh yeah and the entertaining end zone antics br br but wait for the eleven o'clock highlights 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the washington generals matchup br br i was well into the second act before i figured out these were supposed to be pro teams we were watching all clad in vintage brown and cameron diaz character's imitation of a youthful georgia was ill conceived on the page not your fault cameron would you like to go to dinner br br enough of this i'm only on a rant because i was looking forward to this film rent the longest yard instead br br
<START> or at least retirement this movie is awful horrible terrible rank rotten putrid well you get the idea do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish because it's sure to kill you i only survived because i missed the first half hour carrot top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two literally i can't imagine this made more than 2 br br and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith a halfway decent actress certainly above this at any rate had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung was she that bored during that 3 5 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet aka carrot top br br i give this a 2 10 and that's probably way too high i try to save my for movies that make me vomit and since i didn't see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained i don't think i'll be watching it again to find out if it's really worth a 1

<START> this movie was a low point for both jason robards and sam peckinpah major plot points are taken directly from sergio leone's masterpiece once upon a time in the west released two years earlier and also featuring robards a man finds a watering hole is found in the desert being the only water for many miles in every direction he plans to build a 'station' around the hole and to ensure there's a love interest he falls in love with a prostitute to this add an intemperate preacher bad music silly fast action shots even sillier t a shots and there you go there is little question why it failed at the box office the real question is how did it make it that far
<START> i am still waiting for that dark muppet film where we won't know how it ends from the beginning i think linklater could do one hes experimented with animation this time i was intelligently not expecting such a thing but deeply wishing br br joan cusack sucked she moved to a made for tv level lazily acting this one with cliched cynic the muppets were more life life than she was a disappointment br br but then the entire film was bar pepe i loved him he was the only one to ever get me laugh while as god got me choking and cursing if we can't see a dark muppets than how about at least a pg 13 one with more of pepe's controversial jokes and animals metal head egg nog persona br br the worst muppets i saw even the boring christmas carol beats this one out the muppets need to avoid this over commercialized holiday br br 5 10
<START> let's get right to the heart of the matter this is a terrible movie the story is confusing the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite ellen barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on peta wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when barkin and wilson kiss poor ellen looks like she's in pain barkin's talent is totally wasted in this b grade sexploitation piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film
<START> working at a movie theater as a projectionist i have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out when i first saw the trailer for 'black snake i laughed and thought great another 'snakes on a plane' samuel l jackson movie but of course i wanted to see it for the laugh factor many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title the images on promotional ads and on the fact that justin timberlake is in the film personally i loved every second of this movie it tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another the story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live of course i do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from sam jackson christina ricci and yes even justin timberlake i encourage you to see 'black snake
<START> gilmore girls is one of the funniest most clever sharp witted sarcastic and heart warming television shows i've ever watched second only to my most favorite television show of all time f r i e n d s the quick pace and many pop culture references can leave some viewers confused but once you catch on to the ways of the you'll be hooked for life just some random comments i recently finally began watching season 6 and wow it's one of my favorite seasons so far i love the luke thing and all the drama in the various episodes is as always exhilarating the only thing i'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly unfortunately i don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong all in all great season though and i can't wait for the next br br a k a
<START> they have taken a story dear to the people of heart a true story and changed it as hollywood has done before to many a tale the end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate the original movie of this tale that walt disney himself oversaw used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that john grey was anything special he was a poor shepard who died in poverty at the inn if you like the story watch the disney original for a better heart warming story it's a shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story and if you really like it you can visit the real in edinburgh
