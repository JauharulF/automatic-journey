<START> has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in bogota and today i finally got round to seeing it i didn't really know what to expect at all but was very happily surprised it is a crime comedy of the same ilk as snatch etc and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy the style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the argentinean narrator who makes asides direct to camera odd the first time but subsequently fitting naturally br br with my less than perfect spanish i still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow and plenty of the comedy is situational my colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different regions and social classes which did pass me by somewhat but for instance a well acted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language br br i think it is to this film's credit that it has something of a global flavour i wasn't often reminded that this was colombia that i was watching yet it is important to note that many wealthy do live like some of the characters in this film and it is not a mis portrayal of bogota or colombian society in any way just a selective portrayal as is any film supposedly portraying a 'real' situation culture br br i don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour and all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes
<START> this movie made me so angry here i am thinking that here's a new horror movie one w a sense of intelligence then the movie starts the scenery the delivery of lines the costumes the fake gore must i go on there are porno movies out with better dialog than this i understand the concept behind indie movies but my goodness this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w a camcorder the cast are all friends relatives this is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly but it seems to me that someone hung a rock around this neck it was sinking at a constant rate of speed

<START> when taken as a whole for its ideas and dissection of the current 2 party system and political process i think this is a great film granted the movie was not the comedy i expected but once i got over that this film really made me think so much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke there is in particular a debate scene in this movie that i felt was a masterful critique of our political debates and how policies are discussed at them i encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film if you want something to laugh at however robin williams and christopher walken are not their usual selves in this movie they show us that the truth hurts not that the truth is funny
<START> this begins a series which i'll hopefully keep up every week end of films that came out during my childhood Â in this case it's one i've only managed to catch now it was clearly intended as the last word on the subject which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years however in its uncompromising striving for a serious minded approach a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name he's been known all this time the world over the film makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment consequently we get a decidedly staid representation of events Â with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero even so christopher lambert rose to stardom Â as did another debutante andie mcdowell playing his love interest named jane of course Â with the title role which he handles enough under the circumstances however ralph richardson to whom the film is dedicated this being his swan song steals every scene he's in as tarzan's natural grandfather who in spite of showing obvious affection for his long lost kin can't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his predicament the hero in fact is much more comfortable interacting with primates even contriving after having gone back home to save his adoptive from captivity the film is otherwise very good to look at with cinematography by stanley kubrick regular john alcott no less features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable make up effects by rick baker Â and while essentially disappointing as a tarzan outing retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day
<START> america's next top model is a great reality show in every sense it has a great hostess has great guests a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet present a true america's next top model of course this is not something easy to do therefore usa and the world already would have 10 top models and fighting between themselves in this cruel world br br but it's obvious that its intention is not to present the america's next top model but yes the america's next pop model the show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal professional and financial problems giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy it's obvious that tyra banks uses all that for her advantage she gives the dream but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity anyway she deserves it because she is intelligent and if i might say that a pioneer to this kind of show tyra also is a great observer and knows how to give based opinions differing herself of other models and hostess of foreign versions of the next top model franchise in brazil as an example fernanda motta is its hostess and once upon a time top model she doesn't have even 1 10 of professional skills which keeps tyra banks on the top tyra have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she's a great mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom br br the show doesn't suffer from big problems it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles the models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because tyra banks bets with the difference and she is right because she and also good part of her audience believes that it's time for the modeling world to change some straight parameters during the cycles she and her team really makes fair where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their capacities but must be fast to do that otherwise they lose it br br other very interesting thing is that tyra also knows to decide who should or shouldn't win even when she's against people's opinion she knows that whoever wins will be famous but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model at the same way she knows that some times the second place is more valuable than the first because 1st place wins the title but second doesn't gets the title stigma hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the show br br after 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas it's time for tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and comparing to the firsts cycles we can see that she's getting bored too so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longer br br anyway the show explores the fashion and modeling world but it's also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that it gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market and also gives great tips for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream
<START> now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda it came no wonder for me that this is admired by most american viewers and hated by europeans this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round operator work is ground zero etc etc br br you have been warned it doesn't even have guilty pleasure entertainment for those brainwashed iq 0 human beings br br i wish i could enter negative values anyone
<START> in russia the ordinary teenager vera lives a life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator her brother victor aleksandr lives in moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and vera being always motive for arguing when vera meets the student of university sergei andrei they fall in love for each other and decide to get married sergei moves to vera's house but lives in conflict with her father this relationship leads the family to a tragedy br br i have just seen vera and i liked a lot this deep family drama i am not familiarized with the life style in the former but there are some unusual behaviors that i found very interesting the first one when victor tells vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment another one when the family goes to the beach in a truck many difficulties of vera's family and their friends the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in third world countries this low budget movie is very well directed and the story is very profound and real the cast has great performances and the actress is very beautiful in the cover of the brazilian vhs released by distributor there is information that was the centerfold of playboy magazine i am not sure how precise are the subtitles in portuguese since many long sentences spoken in russian are limited to short translation in few words my vote is seven br br title brazil a vera the little vera
<START> while boris is off to fight in war against the germans for his mother russia his beloved veronika marries his conniving cousin mark aleksandr in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over moscow through various trials and betrayals veronika will await word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes holding hope that he will return to her br br powerful piece of film making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer sergei some of the many magnificently framed moving shots include the scene where the camera follows veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to boris and doesn't quite reach him even as we watch boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck the sequence after the air raid where veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes his lustful move on veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light inside are just two of many examples where sergei shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film but without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly deeply love each other this film couldn't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone together however we're left with an amazing film simply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after stalin breathed his last breath i feel honored just have such a great film
<START> i was not very excited to see this movie in the first place but a group of us decided to go see it on opening night i felt like getting up and walking out and attempting to get my money back 20 minutes into this film i felt that the movie was very boring uninteresting and not true in many aspects including gaming i tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie as i watched one of the worst horror films i have ever seen the scary movie series was scarier than this movie the sad attempt to pull in a gothic girl an overworked business man and 15 year old geek and some random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad plot to begin with then they try to throw in a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered the theater was packed when the movie started by then end a little over half of the people had left before it was over if you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time seeing this movie prepare to feel cheated
<START> at first i thought it was bad because i had great expectations for this movie but after giving some thought it is that bad i was almost caught up in promotion of bad stars in bad movies new generation of actors and actresses not to mention bad script writers are bringing the industry down at the moment im still trying to figure out how it gross so high normally you cant lose in a movie with donnie yen and ekin forget jackie he's past his peak but then i shouldve figure it out when twins was on the cover it is cheesy campy very corny i try to laugh from some of the jokes but not only is the effect very minimal but the jokes are very recycled and not funny im sorry i bought the movie the only reason why some people think it is so good is because they are brainwashed into the hype that the twins are cute and everybody likes them and that everything they make is good and funny and that if you like twins then you are up to date br br sigh i miss the good hk movie days when jet li and stephen chow movies dominated the box office br br movies from mainland china are much better than this and they are shot for lower budgets
<START> i was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a badly made low budget action flick that just doesn't have the talent for that story is about a very beautiful woman named teri marshall heather thomas who's boyfriend rick jeffrey combs works for a secret agency and he has invented a motorcycle that is bullet proof and can shoot lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can shoot lasers as well the head of the agency martin landau has made a 5 million dollar deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill rick and teri and collect the bike a tall blond thug named rolf dar robinson and his partner hanna dawn wildsmith manage to kill rick but teri survives while at home she discovers a video tape that rick left describing his invention that helps teri on what to do next br br spoiler alert br br teri is being chased by several agents and she gets caught and tortured but doesn't talk about where a piece of the motorcycle that is needed but she gets help from a federal agent named waters martine beswick where they end up using the motorcycle for a bloody shoot out br br this film is directed by fred olen ray who has made his career out of making ultra low budget exploitation films but he made a dire mistake here by leaving out the exploitation aspect and trying to make an action film aside from a quick shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a ray film is no where to be found i don't think anyone was expecting thomas to get naked but she doesn't wear one sexy outfit not that it stopped me from ogling her in those tight jeans and admiring her near perfect form but ray really blew it in this case like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like robert quarry huntz hall troy donahue tim conway jr michael reagan and russ tamblyn stuntman dar robinson died shortly after this was made and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him you have to wonder why landau would waste him time with such junk like this but i was interested in the casting of combs in a very rare romantic role is thomas any good in this film who cares i think she showed that she could have become a popular b movie starlet if she wanted but it never did happen ray wastes everyone's time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker
<START> i was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose basterds due to it's amazingly high imdb rating i must say now what a disappointment i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence but i also expected a lot of witty dialog i got a huge dosage of the former but not nearly enough of the latter i felt shortchanged the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong and the plot it's that believable or really all that entertaining either save your time and money i can't believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses
<START> first and foremost i would like to say that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual someone that cared about others appreciated others found no barely any judgment against other people and this film has i think changed my life or viewpoint dramatically when i watched it i didn't know particularly what it was about i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that i was clueless and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters i was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time i watched it i was blind blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their as human beings to their relationship i watched it a second time because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being saying to myself and others oh i accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear i suppose the second time i watched this film i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that i'd heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love and i loved it i loved the storyline i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film i loved the sharing of feelings and i loved the strong bonds created it is a really eye opening beautifully done film that made me cry at times and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserves love no matter what shape or form it is presented in
<START> looking back at the career of alfred hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry it is likely a sign of how ahead of his time hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind strangers on a train one of hitchcock's first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique br br arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers strangers on a train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking the brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes if there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of strangers on a train should be enough to disavow such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene these are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film br br but what really makes strangers on a train stand out is the story premise as hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clichÃ©e after clichÃ©e it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original sure it's fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while one can't help but notice the deeper themes hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanity's heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death hitch also works in many moments of dark humour bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easy going environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere this may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable br br the antagonistic figure of bruno essayed to perverse perfection by robert walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes strangers on a train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess he speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people bruno could seem to represent the id as freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind it makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure guy haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing br br yet despite this implied message hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome it's a testament to actor farley granger's talent that despite robert walker's villain easily stealing the show granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character superb support is given by ruth roman who manages to overcome the clichÃ©e and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure kasey rogers giving a stunning performance as guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and patricia hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the director's daughter would imply the superb cast headed by a simply wonderful walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics br br all in all strangers on a train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago once again hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience br br 9 10
