<START> the direction by wong is perhaps the all time worst in film history i've ever seen this film makes my all time worst film of 2000 dungeons and dragons by courtney looked like an oscar winner the flaws in this movie is beyond explanation the biggest one is the lack of depth every scene does not develop fully as if the editing room doesn't know how to do their job correctly its a shame that with such an all star cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of vision br br i am so disgusted and hope that some great director like john woo or ang lee decide to remake this film and do some justice i'm not even sure if i can rate 0 10
<START> i think that this is a disappointing sequel i miss a lot of the old characters king gator anne marie etc and i don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters a lot of personality was lost in charlie and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one if you're a big adgth fan like i am it's worth seeing just to see how the story is continued but don't count on it being 5 stars in your book
<START> spoilers br br i love the simpsons and i have seen every single episode that had ever come out i must admit season one is by far the most underrated season and this is the most underrated episode in season one the episode begins with the family playing a game of scrabble to get bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school he says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it but he needs to he spells out a word that angers homer and he chases bart around the house the next day mrs reassures the class that the test isn't part of their grade just a test that would tell them what their future would be like bart can't answer one question he thinks fast he quickly switches test with martin prince the smartest one in class later that day marge and homer are called to go to the principal's office to discuss bart's behavior suddenly out of nowhere the school psychologist comes and tells skinner and homer and marge that bart is a genius and should go to a special school for the gifted bart agrees to go since he wouldn't need to do any homework the next day homer drives bart to the new school he is introduced to everyone and everything unluckily his day isn't very good the smart students take his lunch smartly he can't read any comic books but he does anyway and he is criticized by his fellow students luckily for bart he and homer start to have a great time together but marge bought tickets to an opera they go to the opera and make fun of it the next day he goes to his old school but is made fun of by his friends they call him a point dexter while at his new school bart is told to do a chemistry experiment he does it wrong and blows up the school leaving himself green bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it instead bart tells him he wants to go undercover and go back to his old school to observe other kids the psychologist is intrigued and he asks bart to explain it on a piece of paper he finds it too hard and instead writes a confession that he really isn't a genius he gives it to the psychologist all he cares about is that he spelled the word confession wrong that night homer bathes bart and bart tells him that he really isn't a genius and that he cheated on the test homer gets angry and chases bart around the house as lisa and marge look at them casually br br overall this is a very underrated season one episode br br 8 10
<START> this show is not in my opinion good then again i have not enjoyed any cartoon from disney channel except for the proud family because that so is about a normal female teen this show is very similar to the way i feel about lilo and the series it was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent the cartoon is terrible disney channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as dave the barbarian brandy and mr whiskers lilo and the series american dragon jake long and where it all started kim possible the shows would have been better had they come to playhouse disney as for this particular show will never get out of school just as dave the parents will never return home and as brandy and mr whiskers will never get out of the jungle
<START> although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society i don't object to the extremely high salaries for many of today's entertainers and athletes br br a rod or brady all have deals either well with 8 figures or the low 9 area ray romano and jerry seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows huge residuals and fees they currently demand even their cast members and all of the friends group reached near or over 7 figures per episode letterman's earnings for one show could solve most people's financial problems and a week or two's take care of many for life br br but all of these are based upon sound supply demand principals and the financial benefits they bring to their employers and all perform their crafts ably br br but then comes along someone like rachel ray who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill i find her shrill annoying and with a forced perkiness that's as phony as the proverbial 3 dollar bill br br a friend of mine is responsible for special meetings events and convention plans for her firm and its one of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the 5 level to a handful who get and up per appearance this area includes trump seinfeld lance armstrong robin williams and no kidding larry the cable guy br br there are a greater number in the 100 001 200 000 range list included the likes of bill cosby steve martin and even cable guy larry's benefactor jeff foxworthy br br this category includes rachael ray i suppose i have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her talent and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who'll pay more than 100k first class air hotel suite all expenses and limos door to door for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization's event br br i just can't figure how in the hell this could be possible
<START> another entry in the pacino as mentor sub genre you know the drill young hotshot with hubristic flaw in this case matthew mcconaughey trying to jump start a flagging career by latching onto pacino's coattails hey it worked for keanu and colin didn't it is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure pacino natch young hotshot learns from father figure all the ins and outs of a lucrative yet degrading career this time it's football father figure plies young hotshot with money and hookers and power but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair that is until the young hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the father figure and all or almost all that he stands for clearly stone's wall street pretty much set the ground rules for the pacino as mentor sub genre br br we are also meant to take these latter day pacino films as a parallel to reality again you know the drill living legend actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an inferior young actor the latter may bear and grin through the process but he must recognize that he isn't going to get any of the good lines much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the pacino as mentor canon scent of a woman and donnie brasco in the former case it was a one man show anyway in the latter case pacino had met his match as a scene stealer in the person of johnny depp however those two movies were serious minded not merely an exercise in showboating for sake pacino has made damn certain that his younger co stars in the films since brasco are nowhere near as charismatic as depp by the way none of this speaks very well about the living legend actor like his contemporary de niro pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels two for the money is the worst example yet worse even than devil's advocate which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked connie nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie well this is what happens when you're crowned king too damn early just ask marlon brando frankly i've seen one too many al pacino films with the same plot and the same overacting from the star to be charitable any longer did i say none of this speaks well actually it's humiliating for everyone involved including the paying audience no one's going to accuse matthew mcconaughey of being a shakespearean actor but even he doesn't deserve the role of second fiddle to this intolerable old show off with the added implication that he mcconaughey will never measure up to the greatness that is al br br i've not wasted space on the plot particulars if you want a synopsis imdb provides a no nonsense summary though i think i laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph basically you've seen this movie before many times the particular milieu in two for the money is the seedy world underworld really of sports pacino runs an office of bet advisers that is between you and your bookie and even has a cable tv show co hosted with several of his top guys one thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words gamble and gambling if you've ever seen or other shows of similar ilk you'll never never hear jim feist and his cohorts say the word gamble they ask you to call their 1 900 number to get their picks but if you were from say mars you'd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks gamble is the f word on sports tv shows strictly verboten br br gambling is against the law you know br br 1 star out of 10
<START> this is a great movie all 3 were the last one was not as good as the first 2 but it was made along time after and it was pulling at straws but you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story just not how we might think it should end br br these movies made me want to be there to be in all the hardship love tears and laughter that the people in this movie go threw it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is br br there are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones be old enough to watch but it is a great movie spanning over 20 years
<START> spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character had complex moral issue round characters and also highlighted social and political issues in other words spiderman was the comic book's coming of age this tv series lacks all of those components it's just a straightforward good buy bad guy tv series suffering from obvious budgetary that make the action scene moderately exciting spiderman is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek nicholas hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time i think he was well into his thirties wheras spider man was really teenager at the time for some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing
<START> one of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies it's gritty exciting scary surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart which can't be said about many of the movies this kind i can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done the scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old from the crypt kind of scenes with a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking the simple yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can br br the excellent cast were mostly unknown to me except l q jones as the moody but funny sheriff and martin as the town doctor martin not surprisingly always ends up stealing the movie with that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies for me anyway what an actor br br so it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition i think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside rosemary's baby and the exorcist one helluva movie
<START> and the worst part is that it could have been good but something horribly wrong first thing first they should not have cast amitabh bachchan in this film at all he is too much of an icon to tackle such a delicate and controversial topic let alone the role itself br br secondly ram gopal varma ought to be ashamed of himself for taking the classic story of lolita and turning it into a pathetic predictable slut fest his lolita is named jia played by newcomer khan and when we meet her she is devoid of any inkling of stolen innocence or that delicate naivety that one would normally associate with the complicated tale of the original lolita who in the original story gradually becomes nymphet varma's jia is already a whore with her eye on the prize even even before the camera meets her and he exercises no chastity in the way his films his leading nymphet from constant panning shots of her crotch to on her vulgar gestures and mannerisms mr varma makes sure he has left not one person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic pedophile camera angles br br oh and let's not talk about the non existent chemistry between jia and her so called friend ritu bachchan's character's daughter these girls are supposed to be best friends yet look like worst enemies even before anything goes wrong between them nothing they do together is believable until they become enemies maybe mr varma should have worked on that aspect of his script rather than focusing on destroying any credibility amitabh bachchan might have had left as an actor br br the worst part of the movie is perhaps the subservient portrayal of the character of bachchan's character's wife her role was so underwritten and ridiculously wooden that it's impossible to actually feel any pity or concern for her i actually felt like reaching into the screen slapping her for not reacting like any normal woman would instead she just stood there looking irritated and helpless as i imagine much of the viewers of this film might feel after watching this train wreck of a film watch at your own risk
<START> this is the greatest movie ever if you have written it off with out ever seeing it you must give it a second try
<START> this film was full of suspense and was well directed the black and white effect made it a great mystery fay emerson hilda who was married twice to the famous musician henderson and also the son of elliott roosevelt son fell madly in love with zachary scott ronnie mason marsh ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture even mona freeman anne and proposes marriage whenever he can rosemary decamp dr jane silla famous radio and tv actress in the 30's and 40's played mostly small town mom's warned the ladies about ronnie mason's sick mind and the abusive childhood he had when growing up which caused his love hate relationship with women fay emerson and zachary scott would have been greater stars with more rewarding roles but their lives were short lived in real life this film is beyond it is a trully great 1945 film classic for many generations to view and enjoy
<START> this is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like joel schumacher could make i suppose a group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other as some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery as the results are completely and as the movie mentions several times have been documented plenty of times before still it's nice to see schumacher practising for his batman trainwrecks with a bit of the old neon paint and coloured and william baldwin is a plank
<START> this movie is so bad they wouldn't buy it back at my local used cd dvd store i only own it because it came in a box set which i bought for the masterpiece deadfall the store bought back the other two movies i was selling from the four disc set but they wouldn't buy back underworld and those other two movies redefined rank so what does that say about this movie so i tried to sell it back to another store that even bought back budget dvds that you could buy for a dollar at a local store but they wouldn't buy back underworld either this movie is bad on every level and is one of those that came out in the post tarantino clone glut of the mid 90's the only slightly redeemable element is dennis leary telling joe montegna that he's a stinky friend and calls him mister stinky friend that line is so delightfully horrible that i can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a stinky friend but now that i've enlightened you with that quote you don't have to go thru the pain of watching this movie
<START> i noted that the official imdb review refers to leland as a sociopath i believe that this diagnosis is manifestly and profoundly incorrect br br this is a movie about sadness and about the ability of one particular teenage boy to see sadness in daily life as it lies in wait around every corner in advance of the unfolding of the lives that it impacts a sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others and who while understanding the difference between right and wrong does not care about this difference a sociopath is a subject who places himself or herself at the center of that subject's universe with total disregard for the impact that the subject's actions have for those around him or her one of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy lacks the ability to feel that which others feel and does not changes in the moods of others as the result of that sociopath's actions with those actions a sociopath cannot feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions a sociopath is a person who is not completely formed a vital chunk is missing from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath rendering the sociopath immune to talking therapy and other treatment that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings sociopathy is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the sociopath can do to others many sociopaths function more or less normally and never raise a blip on the radar of the criminal justice system although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wakes br br leland fitzgerald is no sociopath he is a person who is blessed or cursed with the ability to foresee what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions leland literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that for want of a better metaphor things fall apart people who fall in love and who kiss and cuddle today turn into pathetic elderly couples the electricity in the eyes of mother a wealthy new york socialite who loves leland and who invites him into the home that she shares with her family when he arrives in new york city alone and determined to remain in the city at the age of 12 fades as she explains to him on the last of his visits to new york city that she learned that her husband had been cheating on her all the time that she got a divorce that having one's heart broken happens to everybody and that such loss is an inevitable part of growing up her eyes still reflect light but the electricity that once illuminated them is gone this scene this explanation late is it is in coming is crucial to understanding why leland commits a seemingly savage senseless crime killing the retarded younger brother of his ex girlfriend leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy a lifetime of unattainable goals of being taught only words that signify danger of never knowing the love of another human being of never feeling such love and of never connecting with another person more than any other character in this movie this little boy personifies everything that leland sees as being inevitable and horrifying about the world act killing this little boy is for leland an act of mercy committed because this was the one thing that he could do in a world in which actions cannot change outcomes whereas a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes but does not care about the harm inflicted on others by those actions leland does care what most people view as a barbaric and horrifying act is in eyes the only decent thing that he can do to alleviate the suffering of just one person br br it would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of actions comforting but incomplete for in the end blame for actions lies elsewhere as is so often the case there are no easy explanations and no balm to apply to the outraged soul why did leland not learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge that sometimes just sometimes people do remain in love and that relationships do succeed and that even the saddest lives are transformed for leland there is no middle ground no inner core to which he can retreat and regroup there is only pain and sadness one is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father the brilliant writer played by kevin spacey for not being there at critical times during development but given this man's thuggish nastiness that may have been a blessing br br in the end this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness why was leland doomed to view the world through a veil of pessimism and depression there is a maturity to character present for example when he repeatedly insists that nobody was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him that is both stoic and heartbreaking stoic in that it is absolutely genuine notwithstanding the heated of teacher but heartbreaking in that it is born not so much of understanding as of despair indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the utter certainty of his belief that nothing really matters nothing that he does can change his fate br br this is not sociopathy on display this is if anything its polar opposite
