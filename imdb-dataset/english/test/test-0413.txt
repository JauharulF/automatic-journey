<START> i'm a fan of b grade 80s films in which the hero is a bit of a bad guy a strong male who finds love and this film delivers br br towards the finish you do not know how sharky will not be killed and doesn't he take a beating realistically portrayed i believe however he does and it's not via some overdone 'die hard' stunt the it' team he works with comes together hence the title his team are all characters people on the sideline at work because they don't quite conform these portrayals are funny and sympathetic they have a real feeling to them they're up against an iceman of an assassin with a good team of his own the result is a great film noir
<START> i really wanted to see this film i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing a cop andy garcia has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live the only match is a convicted serial killer who escapes from jail to save his son he has to track down the killer br br michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring it's over the top to the point where you just stop caring br br garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par barbet schroeder at one time such a promising director with films like barfly that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market directs well enough i honestly thought the script was the culprit here it's just a big mess br br the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material good actors and a good director all because of a faulty script what should have been a tense and thought provoking film is just a hollywood action dud
<START> frank sinatra starred in this odd little short from rko that is now in the public domain the film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious tolerance br br the film begins with sinatra on stage singing after leaving the stage he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion instead of yelling at the boys or helping them for that matter sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious and equates prejudice with fascism the kids seem to get the lesson but then out of the blue sinatra begins singing a song that frankly get it kids would have hated he had a lovely voice but unfortunately i think this detracted from the excellent message he gave to the kids about tolerance it's a case of a good message with too much singing even if the guy singing is frank sinatra it's also an interesting curio a nice historical piece that is often overlooked plus it's quite touching even if it seems a bit schmaltzy
<START> i absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production i honestly thought gay men had better taste than this i know i do br br the bulk of the blame doesn't lie with the cast but let's get them out of the way first the only one with real talent was joe souza plus he had the best bod in the cast he had a nice clear theatre style voice okay and voice was so so but he had a vacant expression in every number the rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact must have been really dreadful hearing them live they were also all girly boys except for maybe three if i wanted to see naked women onstage i could go to the titty bars not sure why anyone would choose to film the l a production instead of new york i would imagine ny has more readily available singing talent though one would think in l a they would be able to find better looking guys apparently not br br but i digress the real blame here lies with the creators and producers this score was the most banal insipid tripe i have ever heard it sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cd's threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page sadly i'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is i mean seriously i was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes i think the morbid 'my lover has died of aids song' entitled kris look what you've missed was the most hysterical thing in the whole show genius writing kris missed wow they almost rhyme must be a good lyric and jesus the end of that song oh kris ohhh kris ohhhh kris over and over my other favorite was you gotta be a pumpy junkie boy to be a boy wtf the whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics just because they rhymed where did these people learn to write songs apparently they listened to sondheim and said he's not so great i can do that as evidenced by the retarded bobby bobby bobby reference from company in one song another irk why are 20 somethings singing about robert mitchum and tab hunter obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors again bad writing br br if you love torture and pain and i know many of you strange fetishists do go ahead and watch it but you've been warned
<START> this is my fourth review of a charlie chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days this is also my first comment of one i've seen previously though it's been about 24 years since then so i didn't remember much of it in this one the honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former scotland yard acquaintance who has turned up missing in the big apple this is the best of the chan entries i've seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected though of course if i look at them at closer examination there could still be some holes though i can't think of any right now and no 2 son jimmy victor sen yung is somewhat of a help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early on though of course he blunders a little later among the returning supporting cast from the last chan film charlie chan at the wax museum are blonde joan valerie as june preston and stanley blystone who's brother john g helmed a lost chan one called charlie chan's chance as a fingerprint expert nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane oh and watch for a certain stooge at a police line up
<START> i did here this movie was good from various people plus i do like natalie portman and javier bardem as well as the director milos forman yet after watching this movie i really had nothing to admire about it br br first off the acting was very much below average the performances were just not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the inquisition did javier bardem did give a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had as spanish accent it is pretty obvious why this bardem was the only one natalie portman who i think is a very good up and coming actress did not really make me feel sorry for her being tortured like the movie there was nothing to admire about her performance stellan who i do like gave a very average performance like the other actors giving a boring performance this movie was essentially about him since he plays goya yet he did not become what he needed to be to make this movie good what about randy quaid you have just got to be kidding me him playing king carlos iv look he is great in comedies but him playing a king that just describes the whole movie for you br br the directing was just horrible in this movie when a movie is a mess there are usually two people to blame for that the director and the writer i get the feeling that milos forman really didn't want his actors to put a spanish accent on from the very few battle scenes in here they were all displayed horribly also as a director he needs to give you the feeling of shock of what the inquisition did after this movie i felt like i could careless about the event to sum it all up he poorly shot the scenes and misguided the actors br br the writing which was also done by milos forman was just as bad or maybe even worse than the directing there really was nothing memorable of the movie except for one seen where bardem does get the same treatment that portman's character has gotten other then that the movie did not give you the feeling of the time period and at least it could have made up for it with a quote or two br br after finishing this movie i was just looking at the t v thinking ok why should i care about any of this i do care and are very much interested in history but when movies like this come up it feels like the producers robbed you of something good that could have been taken away from the movie when movies are this bad we highlight a lot of the technical faults in a movie than if it was good like the accents i'm not sure people would have emphasized the lack of spanish accents if this movie was good br br whole point of this review is to say just don't watch it
<START> acting of course think about it closet land could easily have turned out so horribly an entire movie filmed in one room with only two people they better have some damned interesting things to chat about br br but it didn't turn out horribly on the contrary thanks to incredible portrayals by both stowe and rickman closet land is a masterpiece in its own right br br that's not to say it is for everyone persons who have had their attention spans decreased through glitzy sex scenes and random gun fire may have trouble digesting closet land however those who can appreciate good story telling without explosions should give it a look no matter how many video stores you have to call to find someone who has it in stock
<START> i was born in beijing china and moved to the united states at the age of 9 been home to beijing several times since and loved it each time one of the many things i love about beijing is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city you which translate more accurately to if you have something to say say it nicely delightfully and truthfully captures that feeling of beijing i suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie though you might enjoy it regardless br br the story is not complicated intentionally kinda quirky and captivating i will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments each detail from the pictures on the wall to the decorations the streets and restaurants feels like home zhang yimou most likely shot everything on location but more importantly the characters our hero the girl the kind hearted but unfortunate laptop man and the night club owner are each native to beijing and lovable in their distinct ways their conversations really capture the essence of each character the story mostly driven by situations and conversation save the brilliant near the end is intriguing and always interesting br br i am 21 now my parents and i love this movie we are always so amazed by zhang yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters and everyday life into extraordinary situations br br keep cool different hilarious meaningful
<START> mud and sand is one of stan laurel's spoofs of the popular movies at the time this one being of rudolph blood and sand hence stan being while partly inconsistent on characterization how did he defeat those bulls in the beginning is not explained this was mostly funny from beginning to end with one of the best sequences being a dance he does with his then common law wife mae laurel another funny sequence concerns his reluctance with romancing a femme fatale filet de sole while his wife caramel is waiting for him that shows some glimpses of his later innocent character with oliver hardy well worth seeing for anyone interested in seeing mr laurel's early work before his fateful teaming that made him popular around the world
<START> this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon later episodes in the series of which there were four in total were not actually based on original dr seuss material although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style the three sequels were gerald symphony 1953 how now 1954 gerald on planet moo 1956 although he also appeared in a later episode of mr magoo
<START> well this film came on on a workday at the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end it has you on the edge of your seat then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences br br the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film causing certain sequences to drag just a little nonetheless it was still very entertaining and i recommended it to all my co workers the next day
<START> bridgette bardot looking as sexy as ever plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a french ambassador she cons one of her father's top aides womanizer michel into marrying her and it turns out to be the best thing for both of them michel is soon flirting with his old girlfriends and in order to teach him a lesson bridgette flirts heavily with a married prince charles michel is surprised by his jealousy a cat and mouse game ensues between and michel i'll have an affair no you won't and finally michel realizes she just might and vows to give up all the other ladies in his life bridgette and michel settle comfortably into their happily ever after while prince charles jets home to england br br it's an admittedly light piece but it's incredibly charming while some may fault it as a product of it's time i found that completely enjoyable worthy of a rental
<START> the reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script well acted directed shot and written i was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting not even a read through the performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script the actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental less is much better in this case this film is a prime example of how these low budget contracts benefit actors as well as film makers
<START> sigh i'm baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak tim burton ish style and the story that goes nowhere and we got the joke about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time alright br br but i guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore the cute little dead girl by roman dirge as any quick internet search will reveal i mean what is this this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker give your head a shake as don cherry might say
<START> this is a below average martial arts films which is worth watching for the comedy value due to the part where a pair of symbols are used as weapons thats it really there is much to say about this film it lacks in every department because the martial arts are not that great either and with all movies of this type the dubbing as bad
