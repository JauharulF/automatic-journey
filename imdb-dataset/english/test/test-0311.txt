<START> terrible there's no way to get around it a script at the level of one from some mexican soap opera a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast the references to tarantino's work so poorly made are more an insult than anything else i suspect that was not for the shameless and plot unrelated exploitation of generous curves nobody would take the effort to go watch this film to any theater br br these are the kind of films that make me have no desire to watch portuguese cinema
<START> these days you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1 a preteen teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2 involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy girl every time 3 revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor about 95 of shows on disney nickelodeon and cartoon network fit the listed criteria to put in simpler terms they all lack good acting originality and good story telling it as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail they couldn't be more unaware sure kids enjoy a good laugh and erratic behavior if it's done to a conservative level and done right but as they also want to enjoy a story see drama and see people being challenged they don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want they know this world isn't all fun and games they know it's not perfect everyone has problems and we all must learn to work around them this show revolves around that kind of stuff alex mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything going for her genius sister annie her mom works at some office but is sometimes a stay at home parent her dad george is a top scientist at the plant a chemical corporation that employs most of the town they live in paradise valley alex is unpopular and picked on by most of her peers her only friend is ray but she gets more friends as the series goes on her first day of jr high alex walks home not too happy about school but a truck delivering chemicals from the plant crashes into a fire trying to avoid running her over dumping a strange chemical known as gc 161 where the chemical mixes with the water covering alex in it soon after she starts to develop strange powers such as morphing into a puddle shooting lasers out of her hand and moving things with her mind she also glows constantly when nervous though we never see much of that later on aside from her sister annie and friend ray alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone even her parents for fear of being kidnapped by the plant whose corrupt owner danielle has her head of security vince search for the mysterious kid every episode then deals with alex trying to live a normal life as kid at the same time learning to live with her strange powers the series may seem like a girls show but it's not as a boy i liked watching this show because of its awesome effects and drama the producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of teen drama in fact some episodes were quiet violent and a little eerie the unfounded plant manager and vince make good antagonists for the series for the writers really do establish them as a threat and give you that dreadful feeling every time they come on screen also smart move adding david driver of the truck that spilled the gc 161 as vince's bumbling assistant in the hunt for comedic effect but also you get to love him towards the end it was interesting to watch little alex try to live as a normal kid but struggles to perfect her powers at times you forget that these are kids who are battling a giant adult run institution because you are drawn in to the story the show does a good job of relating to kids by showing alex that she may have super powers but she still is a kid and must be careful even some episode you'll find yourself distraught at alex's calamities my favorite episode where alex wishes she was never born truly demonstrates most of these elements as i said the producers never hesitated to add in some laughs whether they come from ray's one liner or george's strange habits or david trying to be a nice guy of course you come across corny moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the series plot but what good series doesn't all in all great show 9 10
<START> oh the horror i've seen a lot of gore movies in my day but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than repulsiveness this is definitely a crazy movie and is very low budget i might add but if you're able to look past the cheap audio horrible dialogue ugly girls the obviously fake gore scenes and overall of the film then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year wow how original and it's up to two detectives one of whom gave a valiant effort at trying to make the dialogue good to stop the killer's bloody rampage the killing scenes which are done with a plastic toy knife are pretty brutal which is a good thing but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream which is very ear piercing as for the gore there's plenty of it but it looks very fake especially the blood dude c'mon purple blood but if you're a fan of gore videos like myself then you'll find something in this video to cherish like i did the crap talking detective he's the best thing going for this film other than that all you're going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity which is also a good thing but too bad the girls are and a very idiotic hippy necrophiliac serial killer sorry but this one sucks
<START> ok i for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film plus with the cast line up i was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books however i got annoyed half hour into the story just where normal films get good this film hit rock bottom br br spoiler the guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks not only that he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths br br but in the end he is happy because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire this film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick ruined a good story shame really
<START> i went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site i really don't have time to write reviews but i felt this was my duty as a sci fi horror buff this is only the second review i have written the other was for dracula 3000 now to the point this movie sucked plain and simple i kept wondering if i was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those lovely comments i have seen movies with bad effects bad acting bad sound you name it and i've seen it but this really sucked i don't care how much it costs or didn't cost to make movies like this and dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder by the way did i mention that this movie sucked i mean really sucked the plot was non exist and the acting was weak it seems like the writer saw pitch black and got upset because he didn't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version but instead the suck factor took over and possessed him don't watch this you'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals
<START> there is a lot to like in this film despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes i for one was sure it was the teacher in fact that would have been more probable plot wise because the idea of the best friend's boy friend kind of came out of nowhere i guess the point of that is that rape is omnipresent you never know who it is going to be ms is luminous as always yet see discussion board for my qualification of this statement like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip blythe danner as the mom is in the role she was born to play the fretting over protective mom some good 70s scenes for 70s fans the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark stained beams barrels oak and cork a must for fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in general
<START> this short film certainly pulls no punches the story is of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter the film goes onto depict how the butcher serves his time and returns to life with his daughter in care and having to come to terms with a life with no future br br the graphic opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered and the full frontal birth of the butchers daughter puts you a brutal frame of mind that stays with you throughout the film br br the snappy flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality consequently alot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes you are taken in fully with the butchers non life particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business his story continues in the excellent film seul contre tous
<START> am not from america i usually watch this show on channel i don't know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time slot creation of hollywood's money bank jerry bruckheimer this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money where the camera crews shoot their travels i don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show it has nothing to watch for in all episodes we see people ran like beggars some times shouting crying beeping jerky camera works huh it's harmful to both eyes and ears the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can't enjoy their race traveling experience even though to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows sucking american reality show br br it's nothing to watch for better switch to another channels br br the amazing race the disgusting show
<START> this movie has good intentions at least in the message don't be afraid no matter how tough it can be fear will kill you in the end it's a good message but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting complete lack of credibility in the feelings dialog that's delivered as if it were read out loud stereotypes instead of breathing living people br br it abuses from effects such as slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus a lack of emotional force br br the suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low budget film from the pre 90s when lesbians seemed to have at least on celluloid an utter incapacity of live good happy lives and a tendency to get caught in over the top dramas that often involved separation death or prison br br had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it and not according to how others think we should live it it would have being less dramatic more inspiring but it doesn't it focuses of pain on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal br br i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection br br if you're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel go back to the magnificent desert hearts even better read the novel
<START> the two most noteworthy things about i won't play are it won an academy award as the best two reel short film of 1944 and it was directed by silent era leading man crane wilbur the plot of this run of the mill short is inconsequential the dialogue lacks spark while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most war themed hollywood movies of the 1940s in other words it's awful admittedly there are moments when i won't play is funny janis paige's totally artificial look and line delivery are precious but one laughs at the picture not with it
<START> john decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of larry david's curb your enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk in other words it's one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation jazzed sweetly in it's score and telling a tale of racial tensions a group of black siblings are the center point with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip club and has a sister much more light skinned than him who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship which shatters both sides the film however isn't exclusively about that cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city which not many films did in 1959 1960 and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day dated to be sure but worth a glance for film buffs martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences
<START> episode no thirteen of the fanciful excuse the incredibly gay terminology supernatural tv series relocates sam and dean winchester to missouri where they have been called upon by an old flame of dean's to investigate a string of mysterious murders occurring in their small town as it turns out a large pick up truck with an unseen driver is running down african americans on a desolate stretch of road while dean attempts to rekindle his past love affair more towns people turn up as roadkill the cause appears to be due to a past racial incident back in the 60s causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in ghostly limbo seeking to kill black motorists route 666 is another good installment which isn't uncommon i've noticed which contains a few notable aspects pertaining to the pair of main characters such as dean getting laid and sam's admitted regret for having left college the killer truck come across as the most terrifying thing in the world though for an hour long show it does it's job well not a hands down fantastic episode but a solid concept with more horror movie references
<START> comparing this movie to anything by almodovar is an insult to almodovar the best thing i can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an almodovar movie and fails miserably the script is dreadful the characters are one dimensional and the performances are the quality of high school drama except marcia gay which is pretty good given the material she has to work with furthermore the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of architecture or the infectious charm of barcelona if you enjoy the grit pathos and dark quirky comedy of almodovar's movies you'll find none of them here spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid
<START> with this film being directed by roger avery and quentin tarantino doing the screenplay i was sure this was going to be a gem i was wrong i don't hate this film but in no ways do i like it br br i love roger avery because of his amazing direction in rules of attraction and his screenplays to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this do i really need to comment on tarantino we all know hes a genius br br this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the robbery br br i'm disappointed in tarantino and avery for doing this film but doesn't change my mind on how amazing they both are everyone makes mistakes 3 10 j d seaton
<START> i'm serious as well i mean don't get me wrong if you haven't got a bent for this type of z grade creaky creature feature why would you be watching is my first thought then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops but to me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood you know the kind the memories that never leave you eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as doug mcclure and peter cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub human and guys now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline munro and her heaving cleavage no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one br br yes the effects are bad men in suits strings parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like amuse us greatly and yes cushing and a surprisingly pudgy mcclure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil at the core of our film but it matters not zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour at the earth's core is a throwback to a special pre ilm time when kids like me around the block to see such joyous nonsense 8 10
