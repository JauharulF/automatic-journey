<START> i would have liked to put 0 5 but unfortunately i can't who can write so bad scripts i saw the movie five seconds and knew the bad boy would be sutherland needed to pay his taxes when you see how good he was in redford's movie ordinary people and others br br though i don't like it but i had no choice i saw the movie in french but i know that hearing the real voices of sheen sutherland and hamilton would have not change things except maybe making it more pitiful br br what makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff i forgot to speak about mr waterson far away from the woody allen's movies he once used to play in br br we had another movie on another french channel a silly james bond with brosnan i am not talking about the real bonds with connery please it's the end of holidays wake up
<START> if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the villain not be more sympathetic than the victim and this fails miserably it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment ok so the husband is rich and cocky there are worse vices and the cabana boy and wife display plenty the husband is a jerk because he um didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw the cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife he then forces himself on her which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him uh huh the misogynistic inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims what was he thinking
<START> opening with some blatantly reused footage from for cat' s o fails to live up to that classic cartoon instead we get an example of friz freleng's tweety and sylvester series at its most generic unlike chuck jones's road runner series which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting freleng's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place s o then basically amounts to this time let's put 'em on a boat it's not an entirely weak cartoon there are a few good jokes mostly involving granny's glasses but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off the seasickness routine and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than tweety says i i a putty tat a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns s o will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's definitely one to avoid
<START> this movie kicks ass bar none bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film since i got the dvd 4 days ago i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it i can't wait for grind to come out in theaters if its anything like haggard it will be worth the wait br br thanks
<START> well there were some great creamy smooth facial shots of marlene along with her shocking gender bender outfit plus her not to be missed from ape into human being but overall the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting not to mention the less than engaging tunes coming from miss dietrich's baritone voice did little to ensure blonde venus a permanent place in my mind's pantheon of memorable films cary grant still in the throes of cinematic infancy seemed as though he was forever looking to find himself while herbert marshall was probably never anything but herbert marshall from the day he was born until the day he died naturally from an historical point of view blonde venus was fun to watch so long as one was able to put aside great expectations
<START> great movie i was laughing all time through why well i am from austria i can get along with the german bavarian kind of humor so i guess this movie makes only sense watching when you are german native speaker stefan and both are talking in a new kind of turkish german accent which became really popular in our countries ger but of course they are very stupid as in every comedy your personal humor will decide whether thumb up or down
<START> this was truly a deeply moving movie in every sense of the word i myself was a mormon missionary and i know first hand the wanting to complete my mission but at the same time hiding the fact that i was gay like the character aaron i was sent home for being found out and excommunicated but being the only mormon in a family of catholics wasn't as big a shame as it was for the lead character this movie really took me back to those days and helped me to realize years later how fortunate i was to have a family that accepted me and understood what i was going through i found myself applauding the end of a movie when aaron and christian find each other again by shear chance at lila's restaurant i was truly moved to tears i highly recommend this movie to all who read this review and also declare it a must buy
<START> i don't recommend you watching this movie if you are easily offended i'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated it's so disgusting and it doesn't make sense all the internet thing is so clichÃ© and the producer obviously didn't understand all the internet rules when you chat with someone you can track their ip address really see the sarcasm here it was dumb pointless and i didn't even watch the end i could always say this doesn't make sense this neither this movie is pure crap at his best nice comment right
<START> it's a shame that quality actors like baldwin and booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money but hey it's a cruel world br br this is just another one of a long line of assassin thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it appear more appealing than it is sure it has some nice locations it's a slick production there is some good camera work and editing and it's fairly well paced overall br br so what's the real problem quite simply the whole premise is just totally unbelievable however instead of spoiling a rotten story for you i'll let you find out what it's all about that is if you can get through it i managed but only because i like baldwin and i kept hoping that it would get better br br it didn't and it had one of the most anti climactic endings that i've seen for a long time in fact maybe never br br but it's harmless fun i guess if you've got nothing better to do
<START> i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007 and i see it is in development for this will be a shame as hollywood kicked writer director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist they should not have the right to remake any of his films br br i love caper films and film noir and this combines the best of both br br tony jean gets out after doing a and after he beats up his old girlfriend marie he plans a big score with his friends mario robert manuel and jo carl what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers nothing is left to chance br br the caper goes off great but marcel sends his sons robert hossein and pierre after tony and the gang after blowing it with mario they kidnap jo's son lots of bullets fly before it is over br br a great film by a great director the standard by which other caper films are measured
<START> what a trip down memory lane br br do not look for great acting believable plot lines or anything resembling a quality movie br br this is pure blaxploitation at it's finest outrageous outfits dialog objectification of women and the sleaziest cops you can imagine br br this vanity piece by the godfather of rap rudy ray moore who left us for good last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured br br you not only see blaxploitation at it's finest but get glimpses of his comedy genius and see why his records were kept under the counter
<START> where do i begin walt disney's happiest motion picture lady and the tramp is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical canon of disney animation the sequel however is to say the very least enjoyable i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie it was flame shield up adorable the broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and i was humming the songs for the rest of the night i can if you asked me to still sing all of the songs br br but where the movie was really good for me it was bad in a lot of other places the animation was kind of scary at times every time there was a close up shot of someones face i don't know it just seemed scary to me also where the hell was lady she gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs scamp at the end she gets 0 interaction with the plot and her only son br br but all in all i liked it compared to the original does it hold up no the songs aren't as good still kind of catchy though the plot was a lot less involved lady had almost nothing to do with it and it's not as cute as the first one but if you go in with an open mind you'll have fun and maybe ' like it
<START> i thought that this is a wonderfully written movie i love little scamp and the street wise angel this movie is very easy for little kids to understand but a good movie for adults as well i liked this movie because it continues the original lady and the tramp and that movie is a classic lady and the tramp 2 adventure was filled with new characters catchy songs brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters i have loved the movie ever since i saw it for the first time i also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character it also shows the downfalls and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with my favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel i definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original lady and the tramp
<START> let me tell you something this movie exceeds all of the troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it actually tries to come across as a serious movie from the terrible acting i knew it i knew she was possessed to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers this piece of dung takes the cake i am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad this may just be in a class all its own the kicker is that supposedly some cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation i did not know that people from backwoods usa act like utter imbeciles i am not sure if i am upset for renting it or have stumbled across a jewel of comedy this was a very guilty pleasure so awful that i watched with hands over my eyes half the time while i wasn't laughing so hard i was crying the ending simply made no sense whatsoever pulling the whole thing together perfectly if you want to watch something so awful its funny here is your movie if you want a scary movie on exorcism move on
