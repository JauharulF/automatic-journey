<START> tesis open your eyes and the others were proof of amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker but in my humble opinion were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience always offering one turn of the screw too many favoring cheap thrills twists and turns over depth and resonance lucky for everyone amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them br br the result is a little miracle of a film beautifully written photographed scored acted and directed everyone involved in this film delivers a carrer high performance behind and in front of the cameras from the wonderful cast bardem shines but mabel rivera clara and lola give the film an amazing authenticity to exquisite lensing br br the film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll this is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in spanish cinema but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad sony classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it don't be surprised it it manages to get in the oscar race there's no stopping amenabar br br alejandro
<START> this film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be the director does an excellent job of riding the line between emotional and physical violence but in the end he remembers what so many indie films forget he tells a good story when watching this film i was reminded of how timid and mundane most big budget hollywood films really have become br br especially notable is an exceptionally strong performance by the film's lead jorge cordova as an villainous thug on his way to the top of the crime heap cordova plays a conniving brutal conceited devious and sleazy s o b but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time br br i read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of latino filmmakers in los angeles called la or something like that either way this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work br br

<START> nights in brings back to the screen two talented actors in diane lane and richard gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present the chemistry between lane and gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace the locations beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet and the story that follows and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care james franco in another micro role is just the right casting and the elegance of lane in combination with the beach house is a true fall 2008 film to remember forever as was the notebook

<START> was very fortunate to see the movie hari om at the bermuda international film festival it was the opening night and was such a delightful movie it was shot beautifully around india and i want to go there now the main actor vijay was absolutely incredible he was the highlight of the movie apparently he was also in the movie monsoon wedding he was the total star of the show character cracked me up was very funny and the girl forget the name was great too they were all great there were many tremendous scenes like the one with the monkeys and basically i just loved the movie everyone walking out was raving about it and it was certainly a high point of the film festival was my favorite from the festival it really beautifully captured the liveliness of india and can't believe how beautiful india is the feeling upon walking out of the cinema was a real high it is a delightful happy film i loved it
<START> i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between and is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the end br br the first 3 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laugh out loud moments make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous br br the end of the movie the scenes for those of you who've seen it was perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn't bother me and wasn't funny which did br br to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the memories that i can but i have to warn you if you're about to for your ntsc conversion tape from the local don't there are far better things to spend your money on
<START> totally un funny jokes that fall flat amateurish acting with one or two exceptions boring characters and dialogue that's at best mediocre after watching this movie one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think i must make this film no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release
<START> you'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible tv movie this movie is an exercise in over acting very bad over acting to situations that made out to be more than what they are i won't give away the plot but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back the only plus is seeing marcia brady running around in a bikini
<START> this small john ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces it has a documentary like feel to it as it traces the journey west of a party of mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films it's on par with the sun shines bright which he made a couple of years later br br there is a plot of sorts a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental the splendid performances of ford's stock company ben johnson harry carey jr ward bond jane darwell etc adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full bodied star performance is joanne dru's denver dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in the last picture show as he said himself 'it couldn't have happened to a nicer add bert superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford this is a film that truly honors america's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling
<START> this documentary attempts comedy but never quite gets there for me camp maybe the more apt word that everyone will agree on and have a hard time avoiding in any review is kitsch it dripped kitsch it was as if the film makers had worried their viewers would take the movie too seriously and so they bent over backwards to insert kitsch and proclaim we're joking around here see br br in short i felt it was trying too hard for example the sock puppets that introduced each scene were to me annoying when i'm sure they were meant to be amusing or at least ahem kitsch ey br br do not however avoid this movie based on my complaints just be ready to revel in kitsch rather than having it thrust at you unprepared if you're interested in lighthearted fare you could do far far worse at the very least the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the bakers make this interesting and worth a view at best of like minded kitsch lovers will hoot and holler over choice bits throughout the film
<START> saturday afternoon is one of harry langdon's best known short subjects and with good reason it is one of his funniest and best films the plot such as it is is an old staple a hen pecked husband sneaks away for a night out with a his pal and a couple of other girls it's a solid and well used comedy plot but the difference here is harry langdon himself his slow ineffectual befuddled innocent character has somehow floundered his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people must be ruled with an iron fist and he is only thrust into cheating on her because he can't say no to the of the chummy vernon dent and the cute fluttering of the girl br br it's a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless childlike character harry doesn't want to cheat but he can't do anything about it in a wonderful bit of comic business he can't bring himself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye he slyly pushes the kiss at her underhand and wipes off his hand as if to chastise it the film is a three reel comedy ten minutes longer than the two reelers harry langdon had previously been starring in for mack sennett with no more plot perhaps it was even designed to be a two reeler this works beautifully since it gives him as much time as he needs to inject the slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half actions where so much of his comedy lives br br he's at his best here and the show is really harry langdon's curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing his little half smiles his look while handling the money he has hidden under the rug childlike attempts to enter the fight at the end i think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us yet at the same time by allowing us to understand what harry does not such as the fact that the women he good heartedly brings to his friend to cheer him after he thinks the date has been blown are in fact whores he forces his to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore his comedy is just as capable of making us audibly say awwww as it is making us laugh often at once br br here harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife he wants to tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film but he just can't affect his surroundings that much and sometimes we all feel like that br br the film is perfectly directed by frequent langdon director harry edwards it moves at a quick pace and never stalls while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect harry langdon's still reactive comedy vernon dent a frequent foil to langdon plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with harry the gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too and harry gets his own version of a lloyd or keaton style stunt at the end here the comedy is not in harry's big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars but in his slowness to take it in br br this is a hilarious film and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented humorists that i know ever to have existed
