<START> so what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks i know become a pop star this documentary and i use the term loosely follows the trials and tribulations of colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic read dance music i only wish mr ford's voice was as muscular as his arms sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin there isn't much interesting going on here but mr ford and friends are eye candy br br see him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune see him travel to new york to make connections see him go back to l a with little success see yourself look in the mirror and ask why am i wasting time watching this mess
<START> exceptionally silly actioner with braindead leads in a story which would have suited a fill in issue of spiderman the action sequences never really flow as they should leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of sound and fury signifying nothing i really wonder how they'll release this one in the west sam lee overacts like crazy newcomer edison chan doesn't display any acting talent yet the robot is clunky and not very impressive and the cgi effects though done by us sfx people are ridiculous totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief i am not looking forward to gen z cops
<START> spoilers spoilers br br i saw this movie last night at a screening i started out already liking tim robbins and loving sci fi the first third of the movie was very cool the score was good the cinematography was interesting the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless i remember thinking to myself this is the most intelligently done sci fi movie i've seen in a while then they just couldn't keep it together br br although from the outset there were a number of more rough around the edges issues with this film namely the editing and later some of the writing plot development these issues were forgivable they became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all br br robbins could not breathe life into his character but did the best he could his female counterpart her name escapes me now was good in her role br br the main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci fi movie or a futuristic love story they ended up with neither br br good br br some of the cinematography grainy it felt like 21 days later some times br br very fitting for a futuristic movie like this br br i dug some of the location shots br br the music was cool br br the film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting br br i liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie br br some of the writing was interesting early on br br the girl who played maria gonzales name can't recall she was good br br spoilers below br br a few questions comments br br i felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story namely viruses obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for code 46 then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends classic 'dream cop out ending if you ask me ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right br br was robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus br br why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom that could have made some interesting story br br at first i like the from across the globe in everyone's speech but it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing i get it the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous but it started feeling like an at t global networking commercial by the end of it br br if they were how could they have gotten busted for code 46 br br was never well defined sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa and other times it was as vital as life or death again loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together br br okay i'm starting to get to negative about it so i'll stop there were some cool scenes and interesting things about this movie but that only gives it a 4 10
<START> soul calibur is more solid than it ever was with the new character creation and the bad ass chronicle of the sword mode on the home version br br the arcade version is more complete even though the character roster is smaller than the home version this version is definitely the more pretty of the two eliminating all of the goofy unrealistic fighting styles found in the home version if you were in any way disappointed with the home version or perhaps thought it was too much you might find a much more likable and straight forward game of soul calibur in the arcade think you have what it takes to become a legend
<START> caught this recently after noticing james earl jones name on the title it was better than i expected of course it's pretty old made during the early mid 70's but it actually is a decent drama it runs a quick 90min or so and showcases good performances from james earl jones and diahann caroll the plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist this makes for an interesting view also in the fact that the script wasn't too sentimental or overdramatized it's almost like looking at a slice of the past all the 70's styles are out in abundance the ending is kind of kooky though probably would've done better without the theatrics
<START> i saw anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as i watch a lot of foreign films in various genres you have to watch movies in their original language for sure not only is it annoying to know the voices don't belong to the actors but they always seem cheerful like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something it makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and i have had to convert a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films aren't as good as north american films that they aren't hollywood enough also they translation is never right it's too literal and screws up the vibe of the movie even if it's basically saying the same thing i watched anatomy by myself the other week in german then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn't want to have to miss parts when he couldn't see the subtitles because he was typing 30 mins in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles he loved it both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films kelly
<START> this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage i saw capturing the friedmans a short while ago and have to admit i thought this was better br br the story is not an incredibly shocking one but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and cold war block deftly guides the viewer through diaries family footage and after the fact interviews his interview style is sensitive and probing and his insights are clear and measured br br 51 birch street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40 50 years of social change the social fallout and potential for redemption
<START> as a dedicated lover of all things egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's along with my other favourite land of the pharaohs the sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so neat in the production quality i thought victor mature was well cast and peter ustinov a real gem the whole look of the movie along with others made in this era has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects i have yet to see the 1999 movie the mummy but am sure i will love it br br top stuff
<START> the man with the golden arm the movie is a decent career vehicle for frank sinatra but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book you always hear about how books are changed when they are made into films things are cut out dumbed down etc well you can't even say they changed anything with the movie they just told a completely different story the characters and setting are the same sure but not the ambiguous characterization the depth of the men and women of polish chicago in the book as for the setting it's become merely a play stage complete with the unnecessary supporting role players walking all too down the claustrophobic interior exterior streets the movie is a dumbed down completely different take on frankie machine and drug addiction when this happens frankie sparrow all lose their psychological edge frankie's drumming a modest dream in the book becomes his full passion in the movie probably because sinatra is a musician and drug addiction is treated as shlock the acting is decent especially the louie who is more menacing in the movie than the book but it's just a shame this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the book it is based upon the real story of frankie machine the movie just goes to show hollywood get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending in this case they just changed it completely an important and realistic story into hollywood fluff i'm sure as hell biased because i read the book first so i can't really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is i actually thought about turning the movie off and i never do that just so i wouldn't get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book but this is an overrated film and while it's not so bad the book should come first as it was the first and it should have remained the only story of division street and frankie machine
<START> a fun romp a lot of good twists and turns and we were not even baked br br didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd oddly it was there along with the city of lost children and the adventures of baron br br the plot keeps you wondering throughout br br the acting was awesome hank azaria shows his talent again bill bob is billy bob br br definitely worth watching
<START> this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i'm not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart
<START> i first saw this one when it was first shown so i'm not too objective about it it really managed to scare me partly because it was so late at night but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story the same thing that helped dark shadows itself and the casting was so right i hardly know shane briant from anything else so it might not be so right to call him well cast but to me he is dorian gray and as far as the other male actors the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport who's so good at larger than life characters as sir henry and john a sort of dan curtis repertory player at the time because of dark shadows as one poster points out this version manages to include the involvements with men in a fairly subtle way the scene where dorian recites a list of men's names to john character as a way of blackmailing him and the look on face were very well done if that scene were done now it would probably be done in a too obvious way and be bad by comparison i saw it when dorian gray was barely a name to me let alone more so even more than the famous 1945 version which is rightly famous this is the version to me
<START> blade is a dark gloomy but vampire movie and is one of the best ones a bit of gore but nothing really that bad wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires not really like buffy because thats too tame but blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night thats at best viewing br br 87
<START> i got to know back in the early 90s via television and i loved it br br what did you like about it the cranky drawing style the flawless artistic action involved the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters the whole layout of the surrounding future world no matter what you loved about it br br the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that br br karyn kusama the so called director of the film was hopelessly over strained with transporting the original content to a new film if you 're not familiar with the original series you won't understand anything during for the first of the film the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film br br attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller it's simply unworthy of the original concept br br charlize theron might be an attractive woman but she can't impersonate the character although she was attached to strings doing action scenes her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique br br forget about all the rest it's not worth talking about br br i give for ms theron showing her boobs and for the nice architectural photography in the film that's it
<START> is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this there's a bunch of apes wandering about mumbling b acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period i can't believe there's even a sequel to this br br 1
