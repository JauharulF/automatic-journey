<START> i never dreamed when i started watching this dvd that i would be totally mesmerized by it within minutes the story was completely absorbing and entertaining the acting was superb the biggest surprise of all was how i would be so completely enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender romantic delightful vicariously enthralling love scenes i have ever witnessed on film i literally stopped breathing i could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses with no nudity or graphic sex they conveyed more passion and titillation than any american production could ever hope to evince bravo to the author the screenwriter the director and the cast
<START> i seldom see a film with such a cast such a potentially strong story and based on a bestselling book that has been this weak and to some extent unwatchable br br the premise of a story reads like a brent easton ellis novel a lot of drugs hopelessness and self induced tragedy as a young elisabeth played by christina ricci tries to cope with being a suicidal loser that can't seem to accept that she is actually living a good life and that basically she is pathetic for being such a baby br br christina ricci is not only playing a tragic personae but also a tragic actor whose sobbing and screeching for the most part of the movie actually make you want to shout kill yourself already and let us get to the credits rolling the director is of no help as he supplies absolutely no pace and the story feels so disjointed you have no idea what this damn girl is actually on about the director apparently was on prozac when directing this imitation of a movie and hence let the movie go on autopilot making it an unbearable mess br br the only redeeming features are a sympathetic jason biggs as boyfriend who thankfully decided to dump the self indulgent egocentric egomaniac and an unbelievably good jessica lange as the cry babies mother lange apparently can not be brought down by terrible script directing and dire co actors pure class br br i don't know if this is really who is or was but the film has successfully made me totally uninterested in her writings br br in the end i finished watching this movie and instantly started to think ok time to watch something that actually is about real problems
<START> man with the screaming brain is a story of greed betrayal and revenge in the a small bulgarian town william cole wealthy industrialist winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a russian cab driver the two couldn't be more different but they share one thing both were killed by the same woman brought back to life by a mad scientist william and form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis br br bruce campbell returns to the b horror movie genre that gave him his cult status this time not only in front of the screen but behind the lens unfortunately for this time around the laughs don't deliver and campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film br br as a fan of campbell who has the movies the books and the action figures i was hoping for another hit to add to my collection although after seeing this film before the purchase i am glad that i don't have the pleasure of adding it br br the film first goes wrong in the story which at first sight seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble which is a sad thing to say because it was written by mr campbell himself the comedy never really hits it only makes us scratch our heads it seems that campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen him fighting himself br br ted raimi the brother of evil dead director sam raimi is undoubtedly the highlight of the film he brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it it helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from evil dead to xena which is why i felt compelled to like this film br br campbell's experience as a director from directing episodes of the tv series hercules is apparent campbell makes the film work well enough even with the low budget in the end there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for but the fans of campbell will stick behind it no matter what unfortunately for this fan i won't
<START> spoiler spoilers spoilers i found the film amusing it was weird and i enjoy it i laughed a lot so the bottom line is that i recommend the film however i have problems with what labute wanted to say the plot is very simple betty renee zellweger a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen she follow her true love for a soap series character dr david greg kinnear simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film and here comes the big question what is the film all about the reference to the wizard of oz is obvious betty and dorothy are both from kansas however while dorothy come at the end of that film to the conclusion that there is no place like home betty doesn't come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we are left wonder what has she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing it seems not to affect her at all br br than is the film about the different between reality and fantasy could be but the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places and by the way the truman show dealt with this subject in a much better way br br the film could be about obsession betty is obsessed with the soap series and charlie morgan freeman is obsessed with betty labute show two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession in any form is dangerous and should be condemned he seems to have sympathy to betty's obsession because he sees it as a harmless one br br all a long the film we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole film but are left for us to think about without that they will have impact on the characters br br the ending is simply a make up that has nothing to do with what we saw before it's a shame because the film could have been sharper if he would have concentrate in one or two subjects as it is it's about a lot but actually say nothing br br what we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little film amusing and weird that could have been much much more
<START> my guide for the quality of the a movie is if i'm still thinking about it after leaving the theater i'm still thinking about this one the next day which doesn't happen often br br the scenery a reasonable guess for 16th century italy costumes lighting cinematography are all excellent it is a beautiful film visually br br characters can never rise above the script they must recite but these actors made the most of their material which is excellent this is one of shakespeare's best plays which people will still enjoy another 400 years down the road all of the principals were interesting and enjoyable br br those who say this is anti semitic must be deaf and blind if anything it is anti 16th century catholic while shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the hurts he has suffered it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame the script clearly places his personal responsibility where it belongs as well br br a great film
<START> well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn't really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad but i wouldn't reccomend it i gave it 2 out of 10 b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the 1 50 theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess you'll like this one
<START> in the eighties savage steve holland put out three movies two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre absurdist teen comedies the third how i got into college does not measure up to better off dead and this one mainly because of it's lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong except for a tiny cameo br br one crazy summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags as i recall savage steve's movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into children's tv we could use more movies from the likes of him
<START> inglorious basterds makes no apologies asks for no forgiveness it's a no holds barred assault on the senses tarantino doesn't care if he offends if he steps all over stereotypes and clichÃ©s this is film making at it purest it's great to see a film maker whose work clearly isn't with by the powers that be tarantino is a master of effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments you're not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing either way it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed it's not for everyone and i'm unsure how germans will take the film certainly if you're not a fan of tarantino's style this may be a little hard to swallow but never the less it is a film which simply has to be seen no self respecting film fan should miss this and the performance of christoph waltz oscar don't you dare ignore him
<START> hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to well this one is really hard core don 'the dragon' wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie nicholas guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show he really performs as a fantastic villain melanie smith was also good i think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated michael cavanaugh was good it was really cool to see vince in this film as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes the fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest i have seen there is so much that happens in the 86 minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer night hunter is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay half com amazon com's z shops and market place sellers in my opinion night hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that i have ever watched and the characters are so neat if you like don 'the dragon' wilson and want to see nicholas guest in a great performance then i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot em ups fighting movies and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy night hunter today
<START> br br i tuned into this movie not because i am a fan of u s high school basketball in fact i only rarely watch nba games but rather because i am a fan of gene hackman who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances in this case however i was sorely disappointed this was not one of the bright shining stars of hackman's career br br in fairness to him he didn't have a lot to work with as norman dale the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in indiana he wasn't called on to do much acting basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees i didn't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest i also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between dale and myra barbara hershey quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between hackman and hershey the romance never captured my attention and neither did the basketball action which was altogether too predictable br br there were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile i never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for dale almost from before the time he arrived the character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed too much basketball and not enough human interaction in my opinion how many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie there was no suspense is it even possible to doubt that hickory is going to win the big one i realize that this is based on a true story but i guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie quite frankly it just wasn't a very interesting movie definitely a movie gene hackman would like to forget br br no better than a 2 10 in my opinion
<START> finally a gangster movie worth watching br br jennifer should get nominated for her role as tough murdering femme fatal br br this movie flies like a bird just a fast paced non stop gangster mayhem br br jennifer is just so beautiful and bad in this movie br br i was shocked to find faye dunaway still lives the cast in this movie are so fitted to their roles br br a real cool soundtrack rides along side and you get swept into the spanish soul of this film br br the story is original deep and poetic br br this flick has a lot of substance and never rests br br the gang of spanish fire just set everything on screen alight br br damian is a joy to watch and a movie star br br sit back and enjoy the ride
<START> this was a great movie something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child the performances by s was outstanding mos def and his singing was off the hook had to do a double take when i saw that was rosie perez there but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching all the different stories they had was amazing and how nanny protected jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence i can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone cant wait for it to come out on dvd it would be a welcome addition to any movie library
<START> when i first heard that this movie was going to be made i was very excited to see it the ideas to make a movie of this caliber as good as it was must have been very difficult i wasn't really sure if anyone could encompass all of the many amazing qualities in a movie but the movie did his memory justice in my opinion the most important task was to reveal to the people who the pope started out as to his days in poland all the way to his last days in the vatican this movie followed every aspect of his life thomas kretschmann the man who played the pope in his adult life and on did a very good job at getting the emotion across overall this movie was educational but also very entertaining
<START> i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website and i must say it is absolutely astounding i expected it to be entertaining like all of the sundance shorts but i wasn't prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty br br if you haven't yet seen any of this years entries to the festival i suggest you go onto the site and watch these mini masterpieces i have seen them all and can honestly say 'the youth in us' is the one that has touched my heart the most i'm not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films but my eyes flooded up so much i'm surprised i could still see the screen br br i agree with it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work and the cinematography will just take your breath away br br i can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes
<START> this is the worst movie of all time no doubt and schindler's list did in fact have more laughs this not only tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great sl is considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh i wish i could meet yahoo serious so i could personally throttle him for this and all the other very very very bad movies he's ever been in there is also very few things to say about australia seeing as they like this stupid fruit don't get me wrong people mel gibson from australia are great they brought us mad max it makes me very nauseous that people like this garbage a review i just read said it was very funny sickening isn't it i personally will be this movie and will start a petition online to ban and burn all yahoo serious' movies for being so and i emphasize this so retarded br br these are just my personal thoughts no doubting they are shared by everybody who has seen this movie br br note if you are forced to watch this movie clockwork orange style call me to commit euthanasia on you for free
