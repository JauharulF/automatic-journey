<START> when i started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the action channel i have to say out of all the shows that i've seen that adv released this one is one of the best shows of all time i had to see it again and that's when i got my chance i bought the entire box set of this series at best buy for my 20th birthday and i got to enjoy it and see more of the episodes that i missed on action channel and the same 3 episodes that i've seen my favorite characters in this show are sylvia leon and nigel the animation in this series was the best and the hard suits were cool as well but the show also has a great voice cast like chris patton jason douglas christine and hillary and more so if you like this show on action channel then you have to own it on dvd it's the best and you will see what i mean
<START> the film tells you to be aware and conscientious it also destroys any and all things the bible claims to be true to people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous it has been called blasphemy and it is if you are a believer it is sad to hear that many people think of it as a good sequel to the bible however the film shows you a lot of things and subjects that can be interpreted as a filmic version of the revelation some of us think that such things are not to be abused one good thing about the film is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice the director just seems to forget that some people act that way already solely based on the fact that they believe and love as prescribed in the bible why attempt to change that unless you be the devil yourself
<START> beautifully constructed tells the story of narcotics usage and commerce from multiple points of view from a policeman view from a politician view from an addict view from a view and from a farmer's view in a carefully storyline one gets the impression on how everything is inter related from beautiful on location shots in the poppy fields in pakistan to downtown to the entry points airports of frankfurt and london to the delapidated buildings where the smuggling takes place one sees the massive dimension of narcotics consumption
<START> isabel has just gone out of jail she is decided to not return again but life is difficult for ex convict specially if they are homeless as isabel when she finds the one that was her boyfriend she can see a light of hope but is now not only a junkie but also an aids ill this will not make isabel surrender because if there's a will there's a way and she is going to fight for her future to have normal life with a house and a family a very hard and touching film that has passed unaware by most of the spanish cinemas actors are great and the story is very touching maybe a better treatment of the secondary characters would have made the movie better but it is really good i highly recommend it to watch it but be aware that this is not a disney happy film it is hard and dramatic
<START> i had a great time watching a couple of mornings back somewhat hungover for most of the film its pretty much a two hander showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor philipe leroy and stunning dagmar lassander i'd seen her before in a couple of fulci films dying gruesome deaths but here she is young hip and beautiful the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel the set design music lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties italian style a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout both leads are pretty good and it bears repeating that dagmar lassander is really really fine the music by is gnarly too perfectly suited to the images director has come up with quite a cracker here but its not perfect though very alluring there's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be i guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but i can't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze more threat that sorta thing especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen this is i suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity its more of a light fun pop art affair lovable but insubstantial like bubble bath recommended mainly for those fond of the 60's dagmar lassander or sweet set designs
<START> this movie was horrible if it had never been made the world would be a better place come on a flying wagon what were they thinking this was a sub par movie with a horrible hook and i would like a written apology from the studio that produced this along with some cookies to help repay me for the time i wasted on this crap fest that i can never get back if you payed to see this movie i am truly sorry because i watched it on tv on a sunday afternoon when i had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week a flying freaking wagon and that's supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children no wonder they don't have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else absolutely horrible
<START> i consented to watching this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike for horror movies however it was not the shock of a monster that turned me off this movie it was the horrendous acting and absolutely disgusting ending within or the cavern has no redeeming qualities it is poorly made laughably scripted sickeningly bloody and the inclusion of the gratuitous final scene me no it is not my dislike for horror movies that makes me hate this film i've seen such wonderful teen horrors as house of wax its the fact that the film leaves you with the awful understanding that by renting the video you are supporting the creators of within
<START> subject matter worthwhile acting fair some of it plot ridiculous br br details sound goes from high to nearly inaudible music is not altogether awful but mostly is dialog and characterization are laughable the main character's process of discovery is blindingly obvious to everyone but himself and the writer apparently animal scenes are just plain stupid singing moon river in an off key forgotten lyrics silly duet to a herd of wild boars for hours as one example finally the wet t shirt contest is so over the top silly that it has to be seen to be hint the who wins is not a well i'm not giving that away
<START> i'm totally agree with from comments about this film quotation 'yes non can't see what's the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually 'get' it ' it's still not quite the truth and as a malaysian chinese i do 'get it' although i don't speak because we do have the similar in malaysia too i know that it's really hard to understand and to accept this as a reality but it is definitely not a 'no real story' i was pleased to see this film outside malaysia because it will and definitely be banned in malaysia too which means either you get it in copied or or hope that someone to be kind enough to it in the internet this is not an 'another violent teen drama ' because it portrays the reality which exists in singapore and in malaysia too in an interesting way sad humour i was just a little sad to know that this film got about 20 cuts in censorship what a waste
<START> but like the disney film of two generations ago this film fails as well in the accuracy department but at least disney used a skye terrier br br is the true story to mundane for movie producers i don't think so there is ample documentation to accurately portray they true story instead of the fictionalized accounts we have had to suffer through br br some day a movie will correctly portray bobby's owner john gray as the edinburgh policeman that he was and correctly portray bobby's license a being paid for by the lord when that happens i'll be at the theaters
<START> preposterous twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateurish and inept way or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity tone realism plausibility suspense and much more combine with walter attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz lang's other stupendous failures i thought the german ambassador was actually played by lang but apparently not they could have been twins if you cannot predict the ending from several away you are not actually alive br br i was eagerly awaiting this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap even with george sanders and john carradine maybe i can wash my mind out by watching in italia instead and for the umpteenth time br br anyone want a dvd used once there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely
<START> although i lived in australia in 1975 i moved overseas not long after fed up with constant industrial unrest the general worship of mediocrity unless one is a sportsman and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north br br consequently i missed the dismissal along with many other australian made tv dramas of the '80s and '90s such as the superb janus and phoenix series which i have since seen along with wildside br br to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and as far as i am aware accurate however as to public outrage it only shows one side of the picture not how families were by the controversy i know as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward br br but the commentary is in my view very one sided throughout the inescapable fact is that notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community the australian electorate chose and chose decisively in favour of fraser as they did again two years later br br this apart a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama
<START> i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through it has a great ensemble of characters an origional plot and an ending i shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings br br if theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris rock's interaction these two are great and it warms my heart to see rock isn't going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life freeman is as always the man really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore hell kiss the girls was watchable with him in it br br renee does the best she can with her role and kinnear is good as her br br sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male 9 outa 10 br br
<START> like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on pearl harbor every one who has ever seen pink flamingos can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile obnoxious repulsive and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones br br filmed with a close to zero budget and some of the cinematography around pink flamingos tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of the filthiest people alive just how filthy can they be plenty the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what i can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo and i guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it br br the cast is either wonderful atrocious or atrociously wonderful depending on how you look at it the star of course is divine and to describe divine as the biggest drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year she is a mammoth creature given to big eye makeup big orange hair and big expressions she is the charleton heston of drag and whether she is almost running down a jogger pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn or startling real life shoppers by taking a stroll along a baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny others in the cast include mary vivian pearce danny mills and the ever appalling edith massey as members of family and mink stole and david as the white slaving baby selling couple who challenge status br br it should be pretty obvious that pink flamingos is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one and viewers who know director john waters only through such later films as hairspray and crybaby will be in for a major jolt but if you want to see something so completely different that even monty python couldn't imagine it this is the movie for you just make sure you eat before you see it because you probably won't want to eat afterward and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> all the reviewers are making one big mistake this movie was not suppose to be taken seriously br br it was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early and as such it was truly a film of it's time if you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasn't meant for you the low budget here and failure of the beastmaster 1 at the box office grossed under four mil with a nine mil budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day you can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races if the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesn't do that for a second in our world dar sees a movie theater that's advertising the beastmaster 2 enough said to paraphrase clint eastwood from dirty harry movies this movie knows it's limitations it's more of a comedy parody then usual adventure soundtrack for the time was also great actors aren't taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young kari wuhrer turns out good br br so if you are nostalgic for the 80ies cheese culture or you liked the first part and don't mind going out on a cheese limb you'll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive dar in the this is not really the sequel to the first and don't watch it if that's what you want it's more of a what if fantasy sequel br br as for the why different dimension and not just different time question when in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1 by the way the movie ends in the zoo because of an attempt at a cheap big finale it's suppose to be the best place for dar to show all his moves him being the manipulator of animals
