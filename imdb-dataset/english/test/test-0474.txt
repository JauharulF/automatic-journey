<START> i like action movies i have a for b flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting so i've been wracking my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster i can't you'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of cr p than this bruce willis vehicle br br armageddon is the story and i use that term loosely of a team of super drillers flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the earth realistic not really but who cares it's an action flick i'm not blasting the premise br br minor spoilers br br the movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters bruce willis is the tough as nails leader of the team and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around ben affleck with a gun for the act of sleeping with his daughter for some reason that didn't make me laugh it was forced like everything in this movie br br the team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid okay i'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action the supposed meat of the movie more attempts at humor with each character going out to do some crazy nutty thing before blast off again lame finally they take off here's where the movie really pi ed me off they arrive on the rock and set to work would you believe it nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful countdown whoah ten nine eight one oh surprise surprise we saved the day again br br and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick i can only assume they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds and this from someone raised on mtv mr short attention span himself br br just when i thought it couldn't get any worse wait there's a manufactured tearjerker ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual citizen kane br br summary the witticisms weren't witty the plot well i said i'd let that one go the acting was bad really bad even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse camerawork again bad i didn't even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures think animal crackers br br rating 1 out of 10 i'm giving a half point for steve buscemi who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times i was able to look at the lovely liv tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance this is far and away the worst movie i've gone to see in the theater ever
<START> it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor he shines in this film as the near 40 year old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child until he meets him face to face this is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the whole family it is about caring for each other keeping some of the child inside you and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids just witness the sixth sense with haley joel osment and he has great chemistry with spencer breslin here there is some nice photography and music and the ending is wonderful and uplifting a great film to see with every member of your family
<START> po like many films of is perhaps not understandable for the rest of the world story based on the few short stories of who during wwii was the prisoner of dachau and camps in his books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation ironically after the returning to poland he stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist producing stream of anti and anti american press publications after few years he committed suicide in the movie changes point of view character created by the plays only supporting role story is focused on the poet destroyed burned out by the war and and his one day love affair with nina jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so called displaced persons life who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks marches patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and or prostituting german girls br br
<START> i saw this in 1993 on a vhs tape but have been unable to find it at any source since this is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the japanese army in the phillipines anyone with an interest in the pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under from what i can tell this is historically accurate and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism i understand the japanese army was completely cut off from any re supply in the phillipines by 1945 so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened i might not have been able to identify with the film's characters but i appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive if i had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films this film would be on it see it if you can get it
<START> having seen 'only' about 200 hong kong films in my time i have to say this film is among my very top favorites not only is the plot engaging and in some ways surprising which these days is rare for any movie but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb top notch casting and while often even the most serious hk films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action often spoiling the mood a bit here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot even improving character relations the music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful with the release of the hk special edition they've even cleaned the picture first release was grainy and the subtitles even if the quality of the translation is still lacking nothing new there all in all if you have to see a hk film that isn't directed by john woo or have chow yun fat in it this should be at least on your short list a truly fascinating and entertaining watch
<START> terrible direction from an awful script even the dvd looked muddy and out of focus laughable accents all over the map unlike most of the other commenters i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn out shots of nude or scantily clad young men usually wet or glistening with sweat looking longingly at each other
<START> 8 days no script that's what the dvd tells you is how the movie was made it's shot in blurry video that's occasionally used to good effect but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time it is very well acted and this helps a lot but the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls women sit and mope they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes would have been a good short maybe even powerful even for eight days they do very little why because they had no script how many movies have been made without scripts not too many i wonder why that is how many great movies have been made from bad scripts not too many why is that working against this major problem the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length actors again deserve praise if only there was a script br br also the video quality or lack thereof is really low end they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from miami vice the recent movie that is but that's not intended to compliment miami vice or this failed venture
<START> notorious hk catiii actor anthony wong is for once well not actually once he was a cop in the daughter of darkness films and a few others not a psychopathic weirdo in erotic nightmare usually recognized for his role as a complete in such catiii nasties like the untold story and the ebola syndrome this time wong is on the receiving end of the nastiness br br wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams for a price true to his word the dreams that wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin' hot schoolgirls but the dreams come with a price that's more than money the sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost blackmails wong out of his cash and business kills his family and eventually kills wong himself wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer but as it turns out wong's brother is a pretty dope ass sorcerer himself and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes br br erotic nightmare is one of the more enjoyable catiii films i've seen in a while absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other catiii entries like red to kill the untold story or human pork chop erotic nightmare though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter is more fun then some of the more serious films of the genre more comparable to eternal evil of asia a more carefree catiii entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore without being overly comedic either definitely worth a look especially to the genre enthusiast 8 10
<START> this one of those social dramas that wb knew how to put together and were guaranteed hits in the thirties this early dead end kids are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated cagney a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school he doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys the idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie it's a lot like boys town with a slight darker tone a useless happy ending what impact the scene prior hard but is still good wb would later make this same movies with bogart in the cagney fatherly role
<START> a group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game but once they start playing it they each start dying just like they do in the video game as they become addicted to the game they need to find a way to beat the game's central villain the blood countess before she kills them all br br the premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining however this horror movie is not scary at all it's actually more of a comedy than anything else the film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch sure there is the occasional laugh but for the most part the film is very dull pg 13 horror films can still be good like the ring or cry wolf the ring and stay alive aren't really the same type of horror film though stay alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated pg 13 the death scenes are very tame it should have been the movie's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good unfortunately the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered br br the acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances jon foster is not a very good leading man he lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him his character isn't unlikable just very bland samaire armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out frankie probably gives the best performance in stay alive that's an honor on the level of being the best player on the houston texans sophia bush is absolutely terrible as october her performance feels so rushed and so fake the most annoying character in the movie is phineas played by simpson his character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die br br in fact most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film it's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive the only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere it's a little old but it still kind of works the film is also really short so it's not too much of a pain to sit through i wouldn't really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer the direction is not very good and the screenplay isn't much better stay alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006 that honor would go to when a stranger calls stay alive is still a missed opportunity though in the end this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf rating 4 10
<START> a brilliant sherlock holmes adventure starring the brilliant basil rathbone and nigel bruce despite many other actors brilliantly playing holmes and watson and making a great job of it rathbone and bruce will always be the best two br br holmes takes a professor from switzerland to london is wanted by the nazi's he has a bomb sight that could win the second world war his bomb site has been split into four parts each hidden in books agrees to give his bomb site to the british government on the night of his arrival goes to the house of his girlfriend he has drawn some figures of men if was to disappear the lady was to give the drawings to holmes on his journey home he is attacked but a policeman stops this and the attacker runs away is happy for the british government to use his bomb site but refuses to give it to them wants to look after it the bomb site is split into four parts each part completely useless without the other he gives one part each of this bomb site to one of his scientist friends then holmes's greatest fear happens goes missing holmes visits the young lady was with the night he was attacked she tells him about the drawings the drawings have been stolen she says only one man came in during the time left to fix the light bulb the man she describes is professor moriarty he is working for the nazi's seen as he has the drawings holmes is done for but he finds the writing pad he used and using science he manages to see what drew by looking at the next page on the pad he sees it's code he sees it's the name of four scientists the first three he works out the code for but he can't work out the fourth the three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb site has been taken holmes can't work out the fourth scientist but neither can moriarty disguised as a sailor holmes manages to get in moriarty's office moriarty sees straight away it's holmes puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea but watson and lestrade insist they search the box and find holmes in it it's now obvious moriarty is at large holmes manages to work out the fourth code a frederick holmes gets round to his house straight away and get and the decisive fourth part to safety holmes now needs to get moriarty charged for working with the nazi's he pretends to be moriarty works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get they take him back and he comes face to face with moriarty meanwhile is not in a good way he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist moriarty has had it with holmes now he has got him and his death must be a long one for holmes the idea is to put him in his hospital put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss drop by drop watson runs in and saves the day though moriarty gets away but holmes was only careless enough to leave moriarty's trap door open moriarty plunges sixty feet br br so moriarty dead no he makes his final outing in the film 'the woman in green' but in he is definitely dead a suicide he jumps off his roof it was moriarty's second of three appearances in the rathbone series a different actor playing him on each occasion his first appearance in 'the adventures of sherlock holmes' was played by george zucco his second in this film he was played by atwill and henry daniels plays him in his final outing in 'the woman in green' the first three holmes films made by universal were set in the war as holmes triumphs over the nazi's 'the voice of terror' was the first then this film and then 'sherlock holmes in washington' then it was back to times with definite relations to edwardian and georgian george the fifth and sixth times this film had a close link to the sherlock holmes short story 'the dancing men' which can be found in 'the return of sherlock holmes' a great film though obvious propaganda it was a brilliant holmes outing
<START> i loved it i had just sat through half of the glass house turned it off god what a morass of predictable plot and bad acting and then i saw this movie i thought it was terrific loved both cameron diaz and jordana brewster in it i liked the escapism of the whole setting the traveling around europe in the 60's thing yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all of the bad things that could happen it held my attention completely even if i did think that parts were unbelievable
<START> laughed my ass off but probably because i was stoned that aside this is in no way a horror movie there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average iq person would think it was stupid on top of that i am living in denmark and have been for all my life and can assure you that denmark is way too small a country that you need and maps to find your way back if you got lost i would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot secondly i don't think any part of the movie apart from two shots from copenhagen where none of the actors were in were actually taped in denmark the bog woman is talking swedish not danish the helmet on the first bog body is brand new the girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in denmark this is just stupid
<START> if vampire tales are your cup of blood then this goth fest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience a veritable of the undead in a contemporary setting queen of the damned ' directed by michael is a story of shadows and darkness and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity br br the vampire lestat stuart townsend bored with a world that no longer excites him has been for many years but suddenly the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change and liking what he hears he ventures forth to investigate what he finds is a world filled with new sounds a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome and he knows that at long last his time has come that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known he presents himself as a vampire and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london where it all begins and will ultimately take him to death valley california where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced br br lestat is powerful without question but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them one of whom is marius vincent perez a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire in fact who made' lestat so many years before and they are gathering coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert and they are not going for the music but there is something else as well at one point lestat has inadvertently awakened the mother' of them all the most powerful of all the vampires aaliyah who is about to make her presence known to all and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her king lestat and at the concert rest assured will be in attendance without fail br br make no mistake this is story and presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments though his film has less bite to it than say interview with the vampire ' or bram stoker's dracula ' he sets a good pace and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be or as much as one might expect in the final tally in fact the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood letting though there is more than a taste of gore and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff there's some good f x on hand too especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern it's a decent job by but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat as it is you get a sense of his detachment but not enough to get you totally involved br br in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat but townsend is even more effective with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly he plays him with a sense of acceptance and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing it's a good performance and one that sells his character convincingly br br as marius vincent perez does a nice job too he is in fact one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous that however has more to do with the way he was written than with performance which is quite good br br turning in noteworthy performances as well are marguerite moreau as jesse a young woman too curious for her own good and the gorgeous lena olin as jesse's aunt who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and br br and as aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer with tremendous talent and beauty and tragically she has left us much too soon br br the supporting cast includes paul mcgann david christian manon claudia black pandora bruce spence matthew newton armand mora roger and megan with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre anne rice fans especially will be pleased with queen of the damned ' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director and his engaging cast by focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way it's presented rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 7 10 br br br br br br
<START> with matthias hues on the cover and only 3 00 i had to buy it i enjoyed some moments like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids but i only really watched to see matthias scenes i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end it was a cross between clint eastwood's the good the bad and the ugly and for a few dollars more a 3 man quick draw showdown with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer apart from that there's really nothing more i can add the actors gave good performances all except the assassin droid whose performance was nothing outside of comical but the movie really lacked depth and purpose simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so until the ball gets rolling for example the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times taking up two fifths of the movie br br the scenery really lacked depth and creativity probably due to the films budget i don't think we ever did get to see this perfect city of new angeles that was always talked about in fact when the main characters finally reached new angeles its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways hardly the kind of kingdom the owner creator of an entire city would dwell in the super high security of new angeles was also always talked about but only a total of 15 maybe 20 security guards were counted even when the alarm went off not even close to approximation of at least a hundred men out there br br if you are a fan of any of the actors actresses in this film then you may want to watch it simply to add it to the list however if you value 1 and a half hour of your time or 3 00 of your money you may want to give this one a miss
