<START> i remember a time when the only thing that did exist where clubs drugs pubs and parties this movie came out a couple of years after i started going clubbing if i had never discovered the side of things this movie may not have made sense to me that night when i watched it for the 1st time with some mates i was completely blown away i had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time almost everything i could relate to in some way there was never 1 character i could fully relate to but more a combination of all of them in one way or another my mates where no different and i remember us all saying that they where us or we where them we had all been out that weekend together doing exactly what the crew do in ht we where coming down while we watched and when the movie came down i remember actually coming down a bit further it was actually quite depressing in our room during those low points thats what's so good about human traffic it really taps the whole situation br br its a unique movie in the way its not plot driven but then its not completely character driven although the characters are important it always seemed to be based on the situations situations as a group and as individuals each character is lost in life for their own reasons yet each of them responds to the in the same way work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all for them its their holiday but the reality is you cant truly escape another situation they all have to face br br me and my mates where no different from these guys we all had our own stuff going on human traffic helped explain to us what we didn't understand about our selves it does it in a way that doesn't talk down to you it made us feel like we weren't the only ones out there like us and that the lessons learned where ones many others from all over the world had gone thru it wasn't until my lifestyle changed from party to career driven that i would fully understand this movie these days i watch ht every now and then as i just have and reminisce the old days no other movie can do this i was peter i was jip travolta i went to never never land with my chosen family i'd have 200 in my back burner and i wax the lot no worries
<START> this short film and the poem which is behind it is one of the greatest metaphors i've ever seen br br the poem is beautiful it describes exactly the feeling of a person that chases a dream and can't realize itÂ but it also tells how to fulfil it i see the story of the cat and the moon as one beautiful metaphor to the human relationships passion and love br br technically it's done a good work too in spite of being very simple the animation in black and white gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message but also of tenderness and nostalgia br br in addiction the music also contributes to this poetic feeling br br nothing else matters i will wait she will come when she can or when she wants to
<START> the cellar is an intolerably dull and overly child friendly 80's cheese parade directed by kevin tenney creator of the much better films witchboard and night of the demons and starring the incredibly untalented patrick kilpatrick supposedly depicting a guy with feelings the pacing is really slow the plot feels far too familiar the monster effects are all but petrifying and the film opens and ends with tedious narrative ranting that somehow feels unrelated to the actual subject matter of the film the voice over keeps on nagging about wind and creatures riding on wind but what the hell there's no wind in the plot like so many 80's horror movies the cellar handles about cursed indian landscapes and all too real mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires and his family move into a house build on what once was the home of native americans but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields half of the script is wasted on explaining the origin of the monster but i can easily summarize it for you an ancient indian witchdoctor summoned the creature which looks like an over sized paper mÃ¢chÃ© rat to annihilate the white people overflowing his land but he buried it again because and i quote the sob kills indians as well hugely irritating son accidentally awakens the beast and naturally can't convince his parents about the big hungry rat in the cellar the allegedly emotional family situation daddy constantly wants his son to love him is very pathetic and redundant and the film badly needed more bloodshed kids' movie or not the youthful hero chris miller is quite annoying but we've definitely seen worse kid actors in the 80's the cellar is very much not recommended unless of course you're a fan of cheesy and typically 80's monster designs the big dodgy rat thing is a real hoot to see
<START> i watched this film on itv and i enjoyed it a lot it was very watchable and very funny julie walters and rupert were perfect in their roles julie walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch ben's character is kinda shy and stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by rupert i would definitely say he has a future in acting after harry potter br br laura linney is quite good in her role as ben's over protective mother the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too villain y ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother and in the end he is quite honourable too the only character i wasn't keen on was she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought br br overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch one of my favourite films of the year easily
<START> i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year it really struck a chord with me i had been anticipating this film for several months and i thought to myself there's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did well needless to say not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them jordana brewster and cameron diaz were excellent in every way their acting superb by far they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles the locales were absolutely gorgeous every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites at the very least certainly i could see it again and again br br i swear i couldn't find one fault in this film it's hard to say that about any film i would highly recommend this one it's touching it's meaningful and it says a lot about human nature and family br br 10 out of 10 well done by all
<START> through the years i've been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound indelible mark on the world my fascination has also been born of fear as in could this happen again br br and throughout the ensuing years yes i fear 'it' continues to happen around us and of course 'it' was happening long before anne the 'it' of course is can a so called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country race continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses i leave that question out there br br at the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader adolf hitler in that the one profound fact about hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle press and fear mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile population br br one of the atrocities was anne frank who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her survival br br kenneth brannagh does a wonderful job on the commentary and interviewing he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves br br many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research which i will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film br br glenn close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part she brings a naivetÃ© and freshness to the role br br old childhood friends of anne's are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality br br this is not to be missed a wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen anne br br 10 out of 10
<START> this movie has an outstanding acting by and a stunning by the argentine hector this is in my opinion the best brazilian movie ever made the movie was filmed with child from the the brazilian the children weren't actors and were casted by in the city of rio de janeiro the story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison that looks much worse than alcatraz the children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman unfortunately this is not purely fiction in brazil it does happen till today a must see for those who like violent movies but take your mother off the room because it is a hard movie
<START> about 5 minutes into the movie you're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are this is what 50 year old producers and out of touch hollywood script writers think stoner life is like as if they gave the cast of friends some pot bland dull annoying and completely unrealistic i despise this movie
<START> while studying the differences between religion and cult in college mindy rachel miner who is the best student in the class convinces her schoolmates cassandra taryn manning bailey glenn dunk alex joel and morgan victoria to research the massacre of worshipers of kwan yin by their leader owen robert twenty years ago in california had found an ancient amulet in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls but one woman resists and he is destroyed however after the death of morgan who apparently committed suicide the students discover that has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet br br the storyline of 'cult is not totally bad unfortunately the screenplay the direction the acting the lines the camera the cgi and the edition are awful i was completely bored and tempted to use the ff button of the dvd but i resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never ending crap on a saturday night my vote is two br br title brazil o the secret charm
<START> an intense dark action drama with unusually rich support from casey keith et al many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it the film is oddly shaped often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but well done seemingly improved dialogues during the almost all of the machine get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues and reynolds the director deserves mucho credit for having reynolds the star step back and give them room and unlike most action films you really get to like the characters which makes the 2nd half when their various destinies good and bad unfold unusually affecting the combination of character development brutal violence a jazzy soundtrack tarantino must be a fan watch this then jackie brown and you'll see what i'm talking about make this occasionally flawed film the bad guys are a bit melodramatic one of the better modern cop films and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern noirs such as body heat such
<START> this horror movie is definitely one of the best ones i have seen in my life and there are many reasons why the storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it the actors are not very good but there are not that bad but kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also the cast is very good such as kane as jacob goodnight christina vidal as christine michael j pagan as samantha noble as kira etc also i just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but that just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore also they look very realistic so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> this series and gold were being hyped as the next big thing in sitcoms for nbc well they weren't dennis farina was terribly miscast as the father in law he just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here the term private time was supposed to become the dyno mite catch phrase of the 21st century well it wasn't people were asking then as they still are today when his name comes up who the hell is gold i saw him on an episode of the mentalist this evening i mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked who not funny total waste of airtime nbc had really high hopes for this show but it just fell flat
<START> thank god this has not been renewed by itv br br this series while popular god knows why has a very simple 'look i've found another body behind the flowers bushes trees wherever they are working for the sixteenth time this series' plot the dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point br br they just to be around when someone does something out the ordinary and no one notices them br br every time they look into and investigate someone's murder they get in the way of everyone else messing up the lives of all including those completely innocent br br they break and enter into people's homes stealing items and evidence even firearms being nosey and getting into people's lives spying on them and going through their stuff they never apologise never get caught or arrested and if they do they can talk their way out of it even though another character who does the same gets put in prison br br they always come up trumps now i know that this is an easy going series but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes put simply it's unrealistic br br i think that they have found enough bodies in the both here and on the continent where they are every other week so i do hope it never comes back br br itv should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum been murdered at the village fair again' type series
<START> a klutzy young man returns west after being schooled in the hotel business via boston he quickly learns his friends in spanish colonized old california expect him to fill his deceased father's shoes instead that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them colorful but silly m g m production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera but it never takes off this might have been fun second string material for abbott costello but frank sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes are hindered by the poor staging sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror but one doesn't concentrate on his performance so much as noticing how odd the star appears reflected in this way kathryn grayson is the governor's daughter who falls for frank and her high soprano trilling turns her singing scenes into self parody aside from robert surtees' cinematography and the decent art direction this bandit remains from
<START> i can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on imdb of course i've come to conclude that imdb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99 of films are rated from 6 to 7 it's the conclusion and failure of crowd on the internet for this purpose an average is taken of most people and unfortunately most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons but i digress the movie i really don't want to waste my time writing about it let's just say i found it to be tailor made for seemingly two groups of people young teens at the age where violent action movies of any sort just hit the spot and goth types that just love to choke down whatever gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on if you aren't in one of those categories you will find this movie absurd i did enjoy the first underworld it was fresh at the time and held a sort of edgy quality the second was a bit trying in plot but i did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times but this whole movie felt like a sci fi channel production or even a tv series i found the actors to be over directed their body language stiffened into un natural idealistic poses that seemed contrived lines were spit out like young actors would spit out lines of shakespeare reveling in their own egoistic glory at being in such a role but in doing so crudely bludgeoning the role the plot was dry and predictable right from the start i found myself wishing things to just move along as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen i tried to care at first but my brain was forced to shut off by the end climax i actually caught myself falling asleep there were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it's not even worth listing them all if you're a pimple faced teen or a chronic goth sure have at it for the rest of us forget it like i'm about to do right now
