<START> from 36 lane to 15 park avenue sen has indeed traveled a long way if the first one goes down in history as a clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a mature film until you see 15 park avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time thrilled to see the director's ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity echoing throughout the film it is not a movie that merely makes you feel how difficult life must be for but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are in some way or other trying to live in a make believe world of our own trying to run after mirages called happiness peace contentment along with the depiction of a delusional mind sen's magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain the fact that at times we all lose calm break down make wrong choices be haunted by guilt behave selfishly and so on is captured with extreme by sen she showed the cruel dilemma which shabana had to deal with all her life of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself and in the act of always being beside her sister always being a strong persona providing support making judgments and so on she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to bloom isn't this a very harsh truth that at times in an attempt to do the best for someone we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their self esteem of course and acting deserves laurels as always because had the ingredients not been so good the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some food for thought bravo
<START> i truly despair for when they discuss this joke of a programme as if it's intellectually engaging and promotes female liberation and independence this show is the biggest insult to women next to all those libidinous hip hop videos if talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over 100 lunches in swanky restaurants indiscriminately shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male in site is considered empowering the fate of western women may be doomed as we speak br br aside from the damage it does to the female gender sex and the city is not entertaining not once has it been funny captivating exciting or original the episodes play out monotonously each character are factory produced mannequins who behave in the same manner every episode not once have any of these shallow unattractive women evolved perhaps the worst is lead character carrie bradshaw aside from looking hideous her penchant for over analysis of relationships is cringe worthy on top of all this the show portrays men as a bunch of empty headed slobs who are unable to commit to healthy relationships even when there is a decent man he is somehow painted as a villain the utter lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some progressive pseudo feminist br br saddest part of the whole show is that these women live unfortunate miserable lives any intelligent woman would never envy them it is a banal show with even more banal characters the nyc tourist board must hate the way this garbage is showing up their otherwise fine city thankfully this train wreck is over desperate housewives is seen as the fitting replacement for while dh can be quite far fetched at least it explores women in more multi faceted ways plus it treats men more respectfully and it's actually entertaining
<START> i agree with all the comments posted so far this movie was a waste of time and energy for viewers as well as those who made it terrible cgi awful script stupid plot and hey the setting is alabama but it looks like california but the worst thing has got to be the native american angle on this which pulls in every stereotype you can think of from the chief surrounded by smoke the angry warrior people speaking without using contractions do not do this thing native american pipes playing in thin air etc it just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that i was tearing out my hair a native american with any ounce of self respect would have tossed their tv out the window at this trash so in closing i'd say this movie is pretty much an offense to everyone
<START> this sequel to problem child is just as bad as the first one it still teaches kids that it's o k to be bad it's impossible for me to recommend this movie to anyone
<START> finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed 80s on a upn midday saturday program would be misleading it deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads' best attributes to its maximum advantage bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre do the streetwise routine that they are so good at portraying for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la fuqua's training day dive back into the world of early '90s tv movies to find scam
<START> i have to say this this is the first movie i'm reviewing on here i didn't finish watching i mean i couldn t continue no matter how adamant i am for watching things until the bitter end 'the ballad of the sad cafÃ©' proved no match to this viewer vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on anyways a long lost relative comes to visit he's a midget andÂ well that's as far as i got what the heck was the point of all of this i didn't even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on as i was already pummeled senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role i call this coffee table cinema the type of cinema that appeals to just a scant few of you but the others just stay away
<START> barry kane robert cummings is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war he goes on the run meets patricia martin priscilla lane along the way and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice br br there are a lot of things wrong with this film robert cummings was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role priscilla lane is pretty but was never a good actress the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense and rambles on longer than needed it wears its patriotism a bit much but this was made while wwii was in full swing and there's no ending it shouldn't work but it does br br it's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest br br for example lane says to cummings while they're falling in love i wish i could have met you a hundred years ago lane pays a villain for getting her lunch and cummings and lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run also hitchcock's direction was as always just great he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences especially the statue of liberty climax br br this is not one of hitchcock's classic movie but is still very good and worth catching
<START> this was really a pleasure to see the dialogue was for the most part absolutely outstanding i thought the women's roles were a little better written which is a nice surprise the performances were uniformly very good too frank gorshin overdoes it a little when he goes into his various cons but this might be his overcompensating for what i see as weaknesses in how the character is written he's very good otherwise harry groener does similarly well with a slightly underwritten character tony overdoing some of the character's angrier scenes slightly ursula burton is excellent as sister theresa really carrying the film through some of its weaknesses seymour cassel and louise fletcher are a little underused here though i liked their work as always shirley jones malick jill eikenberry and faye grant are very good also i couldn't help thinking grant reminded me a little of catherine o'hara here cloris leachman rather tears into her role with reasonably good results br br i wish there had been more of a sure hand behind the camera though sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off or awkward the closeups seemed overused or erratically used to me and we don't always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we'd like some of the tough guy approach to the federal agent music costuming was too over the top for me as well and the few fantasy sequences didn't really work but there are things that were very well done the opening sequence set in buffalo around 1970 for example and frankly all of the scenes regarding church work i suspect the writer and actress liked the character a lot which helps the scenes between malick and eikenberry are very good br br the plot is probably a bit there seem to be a few too many schemes going on at once to keep them all straight at times and the coincidences got to be a little too much and i was a little bothered by the ending should we really be rooting for their biggest con yet to succeed but the ride along the way is very enjoyable it would be nice to see more independent movies like this one made br br 7 of 10
<START> how much do i love this film now i'm not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad it's good this is one of those juan pablo di pace has a great butt looks fab on screen and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut i believe billy zane is suitably mean and moody though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him i felt it in titanic the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example totally broken shocked and put down fierce kelly brook is a pretty face no seriously i think that's it it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big bra fillers from brook nasty growling from billy laugh at the dialogue revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair i'm gona go watch it again now yes i bought it
<START> sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles in this case danish but the watching is worth it as the story progresses the reasoning for the choice of two sisters to take care of their father is questionable but their society is different their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before it provides a fitting thank you for the given to the guest filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty it is a beautiful experience for the viewer
<START> and it's only january still i'm sure of it br br by far this is among the worst swedish movies i've ever seen and to be honest swedish movies ain't that good in general it have been claimed to be original and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a english speaking movie for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can't help but to feel like and stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one swedish package what can i say the outcome can just be poor first of all the story is just weak to begin with even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories first a failed try to make swedish action la matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story and if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the cool stuff that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that sweden also can do hollywood movies which we can't nor should try to for example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about storm while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness really i don't think even stein or can see a point with three quarters of the movie more than just trying to show off poor extra effects for the actors i've got to admit eric ericson does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through even tough storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of dd he does not change one bit in his way of acting jonas karlsson well to be honest i thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by storm really he just have to be ashamed of this movie his character and his scar lastly eva rÃ¶se is just beyond critic both her character and her acting the only reasons storm succeeds of not getting a 1 10 is for eric ericson and what can i say at least it tries
<START> this was my very first bollywood movie and i found it in the same way many other recent viewers did through ghost world having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of bollywood this week i understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film but something for everyone doesn't always add up to a cohesive product br br the ultra groovy musical dance number jaan ho has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965 it's all over the internet now with many folks scrambling for a good english translation chhaya does an amazing job dancing take after take making it all look fresh new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted she rules br br on the beach with miss kitty is a light weight fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot still i find myself singing it in hindi a week later i found a rough translation br br if you want to live in this life then listen to what i say leave your sorrows behind and join the party take my advice br br those who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know come to me and i'll explain br br whoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and there br br my second favorite number in the film is the butler's dream where mehmood is entranced by miss kitty's dancing the electric tiki like idols are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number online i'd seen it described as what would happen if liberace threw up way fun br br is not a good movie as a whole that's why i gave it a rating of 3 it's actually a real stinker of a film with some fun kitschy musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot
<START> i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago i enjoyed the film at that time so i was a little confused by some of the that had been made since perhaps it's my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival i'm really not sure which version i prefer but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both br br let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed there's some cleavage but no nudity a staple of the british production house's later movies and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution this film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short and some of ms pitt's rantings are quite entertaining it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose br br the uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details though it's in the ideas as an occasional sci fi channel viewer i've regularly taken the network to task for its one note variations on a theme cgi monster kills then gets destroyed sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while br br but don't get me wrong i'm not complaining if anything i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts it's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are but for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket
<START> sensitive extremely quiet paced love story between a married journalist and his young and neighbor she too also married they lived their love for a time but the obstacles and the fear of hurting their families and children invites to a separation a reflexive look on delicate question like love friendship honor and loneliness always present in human lives whether you are an american or a chinese i give this a 7 seven
<START> jamie foxx was the epitome of ray charles after a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself ray charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that no one has ever or will ever write play or record music like this musical giant when he passed the flesh the world lost one of it's greatest american heroes as far as the movie the fact that jamie foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like ray was an asset to the director what could be better than that you don't have to have a double play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else's hands to jamie's face it worked beautifully i loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult ray was he wasn't always a nice man you didn't also root for him he was a drug addict a womanizer and sometimes just plain hard headed but i guess that's what made him genius so i can't fault him for that i pick jamie for best actor
