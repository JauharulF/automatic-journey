<START> why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest christmas movies of all time the movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made randy quaid's portrayal of cousin eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous outings as cousin eddie also the eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie even eye candy sung hi lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap please do not waste your time on this move just watch the original again
<START> this film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s in fact to the tune of the jolly fat policeman they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing including one of gary cooper when watching a film in a movie house a sequence from this film br br it all begins innocently enough when cooper a millionaire goes into a fancy department store in france to buy pajamas but he only likes to sleep in the tops the clerk tyler brooke insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as cooper wants claudette colbert hears the argument and offers to help she only likes to sleep in bottoms what if brooke sells them each half brooke has never had such an offer before so he goes to the floor walker rolfe sedan and asks him if this can be done he is disturbed too the request is quite unconventional eventually they contact the store's owner charles halton halton is in bed and gets out his skinny frame supporting only a top if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas half for each properly horrified halton answers no of course not that is communism so the sale is not allowed apparently nobody thinks that cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to colbert br br lubitsch's eighth wife has had a reputation of falling flat most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of colbert's character she is seen as quite mercenary towards cooper selling herself to him on her terms br br actually cooper's character is the nastier as he is rich and figures that everything has a price he is correct most of the time look at the way colbert's aristocratic pauper of a father edward everett horton sees his new son in law as a golden goose he can use cooper's willingness to marry colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages horton when he realizes this takes out a watch and in a most reassuring voice says to cooper take your time my boy to come to a decision later we see horton's wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier br br the film script by billy wilder and charles brackett compares well with their script for mitchell leisin's midnight also with colbert but with don ameche and john barrymore there colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to to francis lederer but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to ameche she really loves ameche a taxi driver but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married for love but poverty made them grow to hate each other this is not found in eighth wife where colbert does not have a background like that she is after all the daughter of a marquis her mercenary plotting is to teach cooper a lesson about his standards br br the film has some nice work by the supporting staff including herman bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that colbert learns about and a young david niven who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to cooper coop tells niven about his problems with colbert and how she is so infuriating niven listens respectfully at the end cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say albert how much do i pay you cooper asks him niven thinks and says thirty five francs a week sir cooper looks deeply into his soul and says shaking his head that's fair
<START> bad ambient sound lots of shuffling loooong pointless scenes eg guy sees interesting woman in lobby manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package says nothing stares creepily more shuffling and other irritating ambient noise wait wait wait guy says nothing woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so manager comes back with package guy goes up to the apartment with the package br br another example the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv more ambient noise and shuffling wait wait wait wait guy wanders off to bed if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie you get to watch them watch tv again later br br if you want a story any dialogue entertainment or a well crafted film look elsewhere
<START> when recounting these events that took place some years ago hard to believe this actually happened i thought well there is a basis for an interesting story here many secrets were never uncovered the horse never found the main conspirators never captured etc br br however this film seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention payed to the plot some other questions are raised though like why on earth would mickey rourke be in this film its good to see career has taken off again but he must cringe at the mention of this rubbish br br if the subject matter interests you do an internet search on the topic you'll be more educated and dare i say more entertained avoid this
<START> not having any idea what this film was about but based on the fact that john leguizamo was appearing in it we decided to watch it well it turned out not to be the wisest decision in fact as another commentary in this forum puts it we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie br br while the film is by no means horrible it doesn't make sense at all the over the top performance by william baldwin doesn't help the situation either john leguizamo is a multi talented actor who deserved better the basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way the result is an uneven film
<START> so where's my friggin trophy i seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately trying to fill the void left by with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men dah duh nah if you pay attention to the show you'll notice that when mencia isn't stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor you ever notice how people in drive really slow it's like dah duh nah not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from mencia's distinct lack of talent furthermore mencia isn't even a as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is which makes him a fraud on top of it all br br if anything good could be said about mencia it's his effort the man clearly has no talent but like a wounded in the mouth of a hungry alligator god knows he's trying
<START> if you love the book as i do stop watching the video after jean and joe meet in australia up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book and the visuals are great 10 out of 10 to that point and i've enjoyed it many times after that the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book i e how jean creates a town like alice springs in the early part the major change is to make a 40 something bachelor instead of a seventy year old widower this rather skews this love story especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious such as in the book he to joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in australia but in the video he gives joe no clue about whereabouts or intentions the last hour of the 5 hour video and mangles the last third of the book i see no reason why they threw in a fight between joe and jean it is quite out of character and seems to be just an aussie dig at pommies for telling them what to do then they bring on for the wedding instead of some three years later and have him read the toast very strange especially in the context of the relationship between jean and noel as cast in the video the whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters these abominations take up time in the last hour which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how jean recreates as a place where she and joe can both be happy
<START> there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii the domination this is a story of love redemption and revenge however this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all if you've been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it this is the movie for you i can't think of any movies to compare this to because no movie is this awesome wait oh have you ever seen the thing with two heads there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it them around but they keep crashing and what not because you can't catch the thing with two heads well that is kind of what ninja iii is like i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things ninjas swords lucinda dickie from breakin' and breakin' 2 electric boogaloo video games about being a bouncer in a bar ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or good ninjas
<START> while it would be easy and accurate to go into why is at its heart indicative of many 'family oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms the real truth is that the show is repetitive full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows and the lead star is completely out of her element while i'm sure ms mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next lucille ball is far far removed from reality br br reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put upon woman of which her entire family is centered yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be mia reba mcintire has no screen presence and to make a show around her seems very short sighted and indicative of most 'family oriented' programming to push a sitcom full of men stupid women do everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable br br the show is a waste of time the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoff just
<START> while he was great in boogie nights i think that this was burt reynolds' best performance he's also a great director and has made a tough violent movie that doesn't hold back a hooker's death by 12 gauge and is an excellent detective story with some great actors brian keith bernie casey etc and an outstanding jazz soundtrack 10 out of 10
<START> every time i by pass this show on tv i absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out and rip my ears off it's so unbelievably horrible the jokes aren't funny the acting is completely terrible and the whole entire show is one major disappointment i hate charlotte arnold's guts and i just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time i hear her talk she is a no talent low iq big waste on society and i think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f ck up and went away for a long time please i say this with all my heart do not even watch one episode of this show it's not even worth 30 minutes of your life and there are thousands of better things to do including killing yourself than watch this show for half an hour
<START> is a foreign intrigue drama set on the title caribbean island which involves a retired sea captain and bar owner scott and a cia field operative petersen the film has numerous bad guys foreign agents and thugs skulking about the pair of protagonists all something scott has which they want and are prepared to kill for a lukewarm low budget tv flick is spiced up with a couple of babes and use some carnival street parades as window dressing little more than fodder for the bored couch potato c
<START> reading some of the other reviews of this film i was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it but overall i have to say it is one of the better films i have seen from any number of genres or countries recently more than anything else it avoided many of the typical traps of more recent international cinema like taking nice pictures of landscapes or being 'hip' 'fun' or imitating american films like pulp fiction the film is unique in many ways for one thing it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role unusual especially for foreign films it is also a film about two men's relationship to each other also unusual not a 'buddy film' no homosexual tension no ego phallic competition it uses little dialogue but communicates a tremendous amount it is a simple story yet full of complex details which are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance i did not find the film dark or depressing everything would seem this way if you watch hollywood happy ending films all the time but rather a true reflection of human emotions for instance in the scene where realizes his cousin is gone is you see both his feeling of relief that the cousin is gone and yet regret that he pushed him away who has not felt such ambivalence when losing a friend or lover or in some other situation it's rare to get these kinds of real human emotions displayed on film in a non clichÃ© way as far as culture is concerned or this being a turkish film i feel it strikes the very difficult balance between being a film about realities which more apply to that place the greater struggle to make it in a turkish city versus a european one the greater contrast between country and city and a universal human story which didn't necessarily have to be set in turkey in this day and age where people around the world are consuming culture and it this film does not try to entice us as nor does it try to communicate it as a reality' or 'that's how turkey istanbul is' and yet the cultural elements are there i think the comparison to 'lost in translation' that somebody made is quite good everyone at least in the us was raving about that film i personally thought it was mediocre at best it was well put by someone as a vague story which supposedly was supposed to deal with that happens to people living or traveling overseas even if the film was supposed to be humorous the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear even for a film or comedy this is necessary and i found myself being treated to a typically story of the alienated amerian overseas going back to as for the idea that this is bad acting or too slow or has no plot i'm sorry but people who say this know nothing about film making and maybe nothing about being human no offense you do not have to be a film aficionado or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this film this film will be two hours of your time well spent
<START> i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch i was immediately sucked in by the characters br br robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100 believable really this sort of thing is not easy to do she pulls it off fantastically br br we know early on this film is going to end tragically but you cannot take your eyes off of it the characters do stupid things but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters br br this is just a great example of film making imho great writing great acting great directing a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment
<START> one of the classic low budget 70's movies this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only interestingly the package lists the star of the film as bone' who sounds like a porn star but once the credits role it's obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the tv screen so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their names br br from the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy new york city apartment block you know you're in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage the direction is from the 'ed wood one take' school if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew then what the hell br br the films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame buy it now
