<START> it has very little to do with the books half of the characters have been eliminated the plot has been greatly altered people's parents are changed for different characters br br however if you watch it as an independent piece try and forget you ever read the books the movie is very well put together everyone is very good looking and there is even a sweet ending
<START> i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that with few exceptions they don't focus on the main disconnect hence the main split in the audience br br on the one side there are those who are taken by the visual design pretty costumes and variety of elements going into the film some children's movie fans love the colour and animation and all the un scary effects shapeshifting animals and so on some culture vultures like the complicated references the of different folklore elements and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasi miming in two different languages in what really was intended to be a children's comedy br br on the other side there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point that a blend of is not a tale at all and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real br br in other words the ideas could be lovely but when you put them onstage they have to deliver here they don't br br a good from any country has a clear story a point and characters who interact strongly with each other this lacks them all a few over sophisticated gestures to opera western and japanese are no replacement for a solid theme br br as a fantasy fan i must say that i've sat through some turkeys and loved a few but this one really tries to do too many things cheaply putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome the other problem isn't that there's no plot there's half a plot which means that you keep getting pulled in then dropped again as another none too sharply executed dance number kicks off br br the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie unless you really like watching other peoples' amateur video this ain't good i'd like to test this on real children i think they'd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes
<START> this movie is essentially a how to on how to be a well connected pedophile i'm amazed that so many people especially other gay men have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if weber was not an influential photographer he would be in jail doing time for child abuse poor peter johnson weber took this poor naive although incredibly handsome teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the midwest brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him many of them full frontal nudes all through johnson's teenage years that ain't art it's child abuse and what's worse weber made lots of money off of it and poor johnson is going to have serious issues the rest of his life weber's lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy as are his ramblings about famous and not so famous people he's known as he tries to complete johnson's education creepy and then just plain boring the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self deception but i can't help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on chop suey weber's nickname for johnson himself
<START> this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasn't that original at all robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together all the characters are cool and the story is pretty good plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this rene russo is excellent in her role and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glover's lines plus the finale is just great yes it's just another run of the mil buddy buddy cop film but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy plus it had some great car chase scenes as well it's nothing that great really however i found it to be great fun and a perfect way to pass the time however the main villain was very weak and wasn't very good at all this is far from being the best buddy buddy cop film however it's still a very entertaining one and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well plus the ending was quite funny this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasn't that original at all de niro and eddie murphy were great together i highly recommend this one the direction is very good tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is a lot of fun robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here he is hilarious very likable had fantastic chemistry with eddie did his usual awesome stuff pulled some really funny faces seemed to be enjoying himself had some funny lines and had a really cool character de niro rules eddie murphy is also amazing here he is hilarious like de niro did his usual funny stuff obviously loved being in front of the camera and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch murphy rules rene russo is fantastic here she had a cool character and while she didn't have much to do she added a lot of screen presence and made her character interesting always she was just great russo rules william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didn't overdo it and brought some good laughs into the film the main villain is ok but kind of weak and rather bland still he did what he had to do adequately rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> i really like this series its funny and unique style of off the wall sometimes controversial comedy is a fresh take on the genre whilst it is a sitcom it stands out due to the what could be awkward subjects br br every aspect has a comedy turn and the show really is very good my favourite part of the program is the rather odd comments of the father dave his rants break the program up and allow a really good flow not perfect because sometimes the comedy isn't laugh out loud funny and the actors sometimes seem to be waiting for an audience response but otherwise this program is good br br i strongly recommend this program and am very sad that it has been cancelled please make another series and finish it properly
<START> okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through but how well was the emotional stuff handled it would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off the image of the ex female making crying noises as she it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever that's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically the previous being the last dalek from series one but by jove it's worked add to that the other ex female who had been upgraded on the eve of her wedding and jackie tyler recognising her husband after she had become cyber and you have a permanent throat lump keep it up
<START> this was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks off the action will be nonstop and i just bought the special edition dvd with the animated background story similar to the animatrix this will put vin diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in spider man 3 as venom he would be the most logical choice for the role back to pb this movie even though it is a indie thriller it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more if they were to do books or comics it would be a great read there was one thing that i felt was a little under done the ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending
<START> this movie features roaches as super flesh eating killers this may have been the first movie where roaches were the primary killers though not the first movie where roaches are killers damnation alley featured a scene with killer cockroaches and creepshow had a story that had them in this one they are the star not as good as it could have been this one doesn't have all that many kills in them i could be wrong on that point however because i have not seen this one in quite some time the roaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them yes she is quite strange as at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer roaches and she is like they are biting my hand and she says this in almost a state of ecstasy there is also one super big roach near the end of this one like in so many insect films not a great movie but worth checking out on a night you are bored out of your mind
<START> in a really neat spin on hitchcock larry billy crystal and owen danny devito lead unpleasant lives larry's ex wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote and owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable when larry tells owen to calm down by watching strangers on a train owen gets the idea that they should do criss cross murders like in the movie and just like in the movie larry thinks that it's a joke but owen's serious br br how they came up with the idea for throw momma from the train i'll never know but it's a hilarious movie there isn't a dull moment in it and that ending was a hoot crystal and devito are at their best and anne ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in the goonies a modern classic
<START> am an ardent vijay fan i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this br br it has all the regular clichÃ©s that one can expect from a commercial entertainer a hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i e his friends to fill in the comedy quota a heroine in a life and death situation a villain which i say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist high octane chase and action sequences music that can make one dance and above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle perfect br br the director doesn't give any chance for the audience to loosen up he just goes on from one nail on the head to the next and one can see the lighter side of vijay in this film which he rarely executes br br all said this movie was and will be perfect for many years to come
<START> i had the privilege of attending a regional premiere for this this is one of the funniest british movies ever the plot is fantastic focusing around a young girl who unwittingly changes into her ideal man at a computer fair whilst also creating a copy of herself who falls in love with him the film is full of jokes both visual and aural and has a bright and fresh feel to it and the acting is of great quality released in u k on july 2nd this film is a must go see it
<START> i don't skateboard because i think it's gay but this game is really great it's smooth fast easy to play and just fun even if you don't do so well it can be just really fun to make the skaters just crash and burn easily one of the best video games ever
<START> i recently saw blind spot in where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion i really admired the story and visual approach the action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing there is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes not just in the desert but in the city too my best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city you really feel for this guy i never heard of the actors before but i liked all three very much i think they did a terrific job on their journey to self discovery all in all this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film i still carry many of the images in my mind
<START> this film is a great disappointment director vicente has provided many interesting films throughout his long career some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril in la he relies on a gifted actress as well newcomer pilar lopez de but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie while lopez de tries hard to portray as a romantic and passionate young woman completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one dimensional feature was an important figure in spanish history and politics of that time were essential in her storyline but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera this is a real pity and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa worst of all italian actors daniele and turn out in real bad performances which in the case of is a real problem as he portrays el a pivotal role in this story it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences as both of them look like top models of this era on the other hand talented actors such as giuliano gemma and pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped even if this was a big budgeted film little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating period pieces on the screen costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes as if they were taken from stock material without regarding of a real coherence all in all the main problem with la and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth is the lack of a director's point of view this a strange turn in career as he was able to develop it in other works and come to my mind creating very personal and interesting movies while this really is no more than a routine academic historical piece and a not very good one at that
<START> even the maria montez jon hall baubles of the '40s are eclipsed by princess of the nile fox's entry in hollywood's mid '50s obsession with things egyptian see land of the valley of the kings etc pure unadulterated mindless hokum lavishly produced low budgeted actually but using sets and costumes left over from the robe this spectacle looks like it cost millions 71 minutes of eye candy the plot having something to do with nefarious do in ancient egypt is beside the point offers the cinematographer and audiences the delectable sight of debra paget wearing an assortment of see thru veils most of which hit the ground when she shakes and thru a slave girl production number unparalleled in film history female moviegoers were not shortchanged fox's handsomest young contract player jeffrey hunter is as photogenic as ms paget while michael rennie lurks around in the background stirring up evil doings in the land of the pyramids for those who might think paget hunter can't act and were only hired for their physical attributes check out their subtle overlooked heartbreaking work together a few years later in white feather another fox production that has sadly vanished into the realm of lost films princess of the nile still stands in a class by itself as a cheerfully mindless breathlessly fast paced dazzling testament to the glories of 3 strip technicolor and the seductive charms of ms paget all of 20 at the time put this one of a kind kitsch classic at the top of your guilty pleasures list and enjoy satisfaction guaranteed
