<START> sometimes good things happen by accident br br i'd never heard of until late 2005 i was flipping channels and happened to see something on toon disney with bats in a being attacked by owls i had no idea what it was but i was motivated to stay tuned it was hard waiting for a commercial so i could find out what it was called br br part of what intrigued me was the looks of the bats first of all they didn't use the popular convention of giving the bats extra fingers where their thumb claws are supposed to be rather they have palms like human hands but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between them br br also the faces they look like human beings in fact at one point i wondered if they had once been human but were transformed into bats ordinarily i don't like this in cartoon animals but it worked here the story is a human story even though it's about bats and other animals not unlike the lion king br br what i saw on tv were the last two parts of the trilogy i'd missed the very beginning of the first one towers of fire the second overall but for the most part i saw all of each of them however i found myself wanting to understand what was going on since the first part hadn't been on and i wouldn't have caught it anyway br br but i saw that it was based on a book by kenneth how fortunate that i paid attention and wrote it down i was very disappointed when i learned that the series wasn't available it wasn't even that recently made that it made sense for it not to be available yet br br however i did find not only the book but also the two sequels and when i read the first book i was left wondering is that it not only because a lot of what's in the series isn't in that book but even had i not seen the animated version the book otherwise a good story doesn't end so much as it stops only one loose end is tied up shade and marina meet the colony at br br in fact and should have in my opinion been published in a single volume because they make for a complete story together but not separately br br actually the animated version takes some elements from e g the lifting of the ban from seeing the sun and some were completely original it's not perfect but it's definitely very enjoyable i enjoy both versions of the saga br br which is why i'm glad it's finally going to be available in june it was a long time coming and it's well worth the wait
<START> ok let's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad it's really bad rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along lek here in holland but not often costa is about 4 girls going to spain to go on vacation party get drunk get laid u know the drill it's also about the world of clubbers or pro's who're trying to lure the crowd into their club br br i'm not sure how long it took to write the script but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long nothing and i mean nothing is believable in this movie it's almost too for words what happens with the storyline suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing with a one on one fight with 'the bad guy in black' and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank car can it be more cheesy also the words character development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers br br after having seen traffic 3 days before this i fell from sheer brilliance from a piece of art to this this is film making at it's saddest and don't start about low budget because even with a low budget you could write a better script it almost seems that the film makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie br br anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit but for the rest of it don't waste your money on such garbage
<START> ok this simply is the worst movie ever made period horrible acting sets and music ok everything sucks in this movie i almost forgot the special effects are great also so if you like bad movies watch this it can surely make you laugh
<START> i sell the dead 2009 1 2 dominic monaghan larry fessenden ron perlman angus scrimm john speredakos eileen brenda cooney uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the '60s horror films by roger corman and hammer studios with two cretinous grave robbers monaghan and fessenden facing final punishments for the crimes via the guillotine but not before their tales of the occult can be recalled in flashbacks amusing and a few well sprinkled jolts but really a mess of a b movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets perlman and scrimm to no avail a good rental for halloween dir glenn
<START> i really can't see why people seem to dislike this film i found it very entertaining of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura fraser is a bonus when i first heard about it i thought it would be along the lines of a role reversed weird science and to an extent this is true however there is a twist which i really didn't see coming having seen the trailer on the dvd which i hadn't seen before watching the film i saw that the twist is actually shown in the trailer very strange br br as the film progresses the weird science comparison fits less and less and i think this is the better of the two films certainly there are some scenes which don't work wonderfully but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young cast br br in summary i'd suggest that this is a fine example of a sci fi chick flick and i don't think i've seen many of them
<START> i thought this film was excellent quirky and different to the usual run of the mill cop catching serial killer' film kiefer sutherland was brilliant as usual i really don't think i have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly the dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood and the plot engaging thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with alice in wonderland i hadn't picked up on those i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of kiefer as i am and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours it was a shame that it wasn't released at the cinemas for a wider audience
<START> to this day malcolm mclaren is telling anyone daft enough to believe him that the sex pistols were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money there is a good reason for him doing this namely that he is a liar br br here are some real facts br br mclaren was actually approached by the band to be manager not the other way round br br the pistols were a proper organic band and not created by mclaren or anyone else jones and cook were childhood friends rotten and vicious went back a long way too this is something that has led to unfair criticism of the pistols down the years as they have been likened to manufactured boy bands br br the band and no one else wrote the songs recorded them played live created the publicity and gave the interviews br br mclaren did not instigate the bill incident the pistols only appeared on the programme because queen had pulled out according to the band mclaren was cowering in the back in case arrests were about to be made br br johnny rotten walked out of the band he was not sacked br br far from the sex pistols john lydon rotten actually successfully sued him in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money some of the evidence used by lawyers was from mclaren's boasting in 'the great rock roll this would suggest that mclaren is none too bright despite his affectations br br the and subsequent pay offs from a m and emi were again not engineered it was merely the way things panned out br br mclaren boasts about the money he made from the band if he had been competent he could have made a great deal more it seems he even organise gigs properly br br mclaren's claim at the start of the film that he invented punk rock can be disproved in about ten seconds the pistols were not the first punk band merely the most high profile br br this is a terrible film the only parts worth watching are the genuine footage of the band later put to much better use in 'the filth and the fury'
<START> first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i'm not easy to scare but second half of this thriller didn't work quite a well but still very scary a good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror lowbudget set in russia unknown cast and made in europe but still great fun and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well
<START> this film is just plain lovely it's funny as hell and as old as the hills the acting is superb and it's fascinating seeing post war britain and how we used to behave in those days this seems to have been some pre runner to the st trinians films given the alastair sim and margaret rutherford connection there's also a very young george cole in there who appeared in many st trinians films but i don't myself understand the connection it was shown on recently after a biography of st trinians creator ronald however i missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time
<START> when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff this however was the cheesiest i ever owned but i guess i sold it too bad well what to write better than manos the hands of fate and worse than critters 4 but it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it the acting isn't that terrible compared to several other eighties trash in fact i kind of like the old man even though he look that indian to me but i guess you can't have everything do yourselves a favour and look this up
<START> if anyone at national lampoon is reading this please stop the crap your pulling out of your bum really now why the hell are you doing movies like these they're not funny and watching it for the sexual content is a complete waste of time really it is such a horrible movie you may want to shoot yourself while your watching it i am serious here guys it makes and kumar go to blah blah blah look like an actual good movie and we all know that h k is one of the worst movies ever made it really sucks it really does how bad it is well even losers that actually like national lampoon shall hate this movie they'll want to murder the director i swear to god i hate you national lampoon die already die
<START> as a fan of old warner brothers gangster movies i had to check this out its the 2nd best movie in the adventure classics dvd set that also had one of my favorite movies scott of the antarctic on it this was made in 1939 a good year for a lot of warner brothers movies it boasts a great cast john garfield claude rains ann sheridan and the dead end kids who would be later known as the bowery boys at monogram pictures well a boxer garfield gets framed for a murder he did'nt commit and is on the run and being tailed by a tough new york detective claude rains he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman gloria dickson and the dead end kids huntz hall leo gorcey benard punsley billy halop bobby jordan dell he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile this was directed by famed director busby berkley who directed timeless classics like 42nd street of 1933 and 35 footlight parade and many others i would like to give a shout out to platinum dvd video for putting out a lot of good budget priced dvd's like adventure classics see my scott of the antarctic review i give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10 great movie ill have to point out that i have only seen 2 john garfield movies this one and body and soul i thought he was a very good actor
<START> i can think of no movie that better captures the concept of grace in a theological sense the well intentioned religiosity of a small congregation gone awry after the death of their leader robs from them the very thing they preach grace the costly gift of a humbled parisian culinary genius returns them to their calling to love one another and an aging general concerned that he's wasted his life choices is a central theme as well as grace at the same time artistic gifting is recognized as having a powerful transcendent role to play in everyday life and the life to come impossible to improve or ignore this is a life changing film for those who hear its message
<START> the director ramin delivers the goods with somewhere in the city this hilarious farce i believe is in the tradition of a mel brooks comedy pokes fun at new york society by creating the believable eccentric and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them peter stormare's performance as a gay shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh ability of self centered ambition sandra bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight self obsessed therapist i really enjoyed sandra's performance immensely especially since i haven't really been a very big fan until now bai ling ornella muti and round out an international ensemble par excellence i loved the scene with robert john burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it with a cameo appearance by mayor ed koch and a solid performance by paul anthony stewart the revolutionary momma's boy somewhere in the city entertains without missing a beat
<START> very literate intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the hungary of 1956 by invading russian communist regime kerr and robards play lovers she a british baroness he a hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country other new york theater stars of the period anne jackson e g marshall play an american couple traveling with their two young sons including ronny howard in his screen debut jackson's character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon to be communist country she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we've come to know today from redgrave fonda streep leading the pack of soviet wolves is yul brynner magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite kerr in the king and i he is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely patrician heroic kerr this is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the golden era of american film do not miss it
