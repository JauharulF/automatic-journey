<START> what kind i say about this movie well for starters i thought that this film was okay not the greatest not worst i said this cause i thought that the script was great and original really different and refreshing now i wouldn't say that it's the greatest film that i've seeing cause of the acting the actors that played each role seems that they played them without emotions as if they took the life out of them when the wife laughed or cried this didn't look real to me for some reason that's just an example but sincerely all the characters didn't act real at all i wish i could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it at least once but how can i do that since i know that i'm not going to see this movie again i rented this film from the library of my school without hearing anything about the film itself or the director i took a chance because the story that was describe on the back sounded really interesting and it really was
<START> i wasn't even born when this series was released in the usa it took about another decade before british tv networks laid hold of it br br in fact i was fortunate enough to see the very first episode in which the lone ranger was one of a posse who ran into an ambush and got slaughtered was the only survivor although badly wounded he was saved by a passing indian called tonto i believe he took to wearing a mask in order to hide his true identity for fear of but instead he made himself all the more recognisable dunno if he wore it in his sleep br br this was saturday teatime staple the fanfare of william overture presaged a dash to the telly food still in hand though it very quickly became repetitive predictable hokum nobody ever unmasked him nobody ever landed a punch nobody ever out shot him he was a little too good and just a little too camp in his dress for most kids poor tonto on the other hand became his aunt sally he was always getting slugged and tied up and kidnapped and stuff br br and what did he keep calling the lone ranger 'king was the general consensus where i lived it seemed to imply 'the big know all' in indian speak but is sounded like something else as if mr had a speech defect what the hell's that br br a later and less well duo called 'the range and west' eventually won my vote this featured a naked faced jock mahoney who got beat up pretty thoroughly in each episode and was altogether less camp less super and more believable br br still even today i can't hear william overture without expecting the gallop of hooves and a hearty hi oh silver br br devine daftness
<START> race against fear has to be one of the most moving tv movies i've seen for a long time all of the performances from the main actors were superb especially that of ariana richards mickey carlyle william coach kurt and susan blakely margaret carlyle ariana in particular put on an extremely emotional performance with facial expressions to match she portrayed the emotions that mickey was feeling perfectly and you could easily believe that she really had been raped so realistic was her performance br br raf is an incredibly realistic movie due to the moving performances from the cast came across as a rapist incredibly well and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed blakely also put on an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl mickey carlyle and you felt increasingly sorry for the carlyle family because no one believed them about the rape br br all in all raf is a great movie it is both moving and full of suspense as you are continually unsure if would be prosecuted for the rape due to the lack of witnesses evidence and belief in the claim i thoroughly recommend seeing this movie
<START> it's so depressing when film makers try to be cool and it's so obvious here this has below average acting laughable dialogue split screens that are difficult to watch and many goofs in it's attempt to be a period film and autobiographical this film should be avoided at all costs i was told not to go and see this film i wish i had listened
<START> this british documentary was recently shown on comedy central during their best ofÂ week and can also be seen on south park's second season dvd i remember seeing many commercials for the dvd showing clips of this documentary most of which occurs with matt stone trey parker and some other guy in a hot tub it was funny when i saw it in the commercials but i was used to seeing it by the time i saw the actual documentary br br overall goin' down to south park is a fairly funny and interesting look at how south park episodes are made and of the series' history going back to when matt and trey came up with the idea in college however there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing it's not as fast paced rapid fire and as lively as the actual south park episodes instead it kind of has a slow dry wit style which at times can be funny but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen if you get the chance to watch it by all means go for it but i don't think you're really missing much if you never see it br br my imdb rating 7 10
<START> the first half hour of homegrown was rather boring and not absorbing but as the film progressed so did my interest in the characters and the plot several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern california they witness the murder of the owner malcolm john lithgow and they take over the weed for their own the three rather simple minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest while all of the time trying to convince everyone that malcolm is still alive while the movie had several faults and a slow beginning it turned out to be worthwhile 7 10 stars
<START> back in the 60's this grim study of joy a young proletarian wife was the introduction to the career of ken loach who became one of the most distinguished and respected british filmmakers of all time by then i knew very little about brecht politics or the reality of the under privileged and i was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film its free style its austere color cinematography and monologues in front of the camera i was also much surprised to find that terence stamp who had become a celebrity thanks to billy budd the collector and modesty blaise had so little screen time although 20th century fox distributed poor cow in panama loach did not stay in mainstream cinema which this film hardly is and i lost contact with his films i just heard of his successes kes family life black jack until i caught up in the 80's the beautiful title song by donovan by the way is available in his anthology troubadour
<START> seems like some of the previous reviewers has seen another movie than what i saw earlier tonight actually this movie is the reason why i registered at imdb sure bobbie phillips can fight and for that i give this movie a 2 but the rest of this movie is just pure crap the acting is bad the plot is bad the camera angles are bad and the effects are bad sure the actors are in physical good shape but they cannot act sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it sure if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you if not then stay away from this film ps sorry for any spelling mistakes i am just tired as a cause of this movie
<START> excellent story of lives that need repair one of those rare films that i could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters glenn close was excellent in the title role it was also nice to see christopher walken in a more normal role
<START> this space snippet was kind of dumb i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending but imho it was just a huge letdown joseph campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me the other comment on here is not correct the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season this thing was supposed to be taken seriously the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice
<START> many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war ii on the eastern front characters well portrayed and unforgettable one episode leaves you wishing for the next pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of are listed an untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals sometimes brutal sometimes romantic always filled with real people and dialog produced with excellent sets and camera work heroes and villains criminals and priests patriots and traitors portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time i wish to buy a copy for my own collection so to be able to enjoy the series repeatedly
<START> i loved this movie not because of the romantic story lines between women but for the visualization of human strength despair and liberation this film is a must see entertaining emotional captivating all the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors this story is a story of self discovery and sexual awakening a journey of the mind body and soul you find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points even the storyline br br i do have to say that i recommend watching the movie first then read the book if you read the book first you will be slightly disappointed the screenplay adaption cut out a lot and some things were changed some for the better and some for the worst
<START> i've been waiting for this movie for so many years the best part is that it lives up to my visions this is a must see for any tenacious d or true jack black fan it's just so great to see jb and lee on the big screen it's not a true story but who cares the d is the greatest band on earth i had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it non stop to see the movie was pure bliss for me and my hubby we've both met jack and kyle after 2 different tenacious d concerts and also saw them when they toured with weezer we left that concert after the d was done playing nobody can top their show long live the d d
<START> ok maybe it doesn't deserve an oscar or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isn't outstanding there's no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semi gory 21st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesn't matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this movie br br sure the first 40 minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is looking for 2 hours of fun mindless violence and a kick ass ending which i won't spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip tease that wasn't as nasty as anything an online pop up would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fast forward or turn off the dvd br br the violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called and 'hostel' but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing br br in conclusion i'm not surprised house of wax didn't make a place on the imdb top 250 but it is definitely worth a look
<START> right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful gina great climactic scene when god destroys the idol and a lot more with de at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as or george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa i guess will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in 1959 and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more
