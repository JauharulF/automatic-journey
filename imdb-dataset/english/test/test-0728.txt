<START> i can find no redeeming value to this movie it appears to be loosely based on the lion king school of thought father gets killed son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away etc etc etc the only difference other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle is that barnyard tries to liven things up with club type music they go way over the top in trying to be cool the problem is that it really isn't cool it's like that guy everybody knows at least one of those guys who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth they try to be cool to fit in but they really aren't that's this movie br br but hey if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away by all means don't let me stop you
<START> this film was set filmed and premiered in oxford miss the hometown of w faulkner the locale of the 1948 book most of the extras were locals i've been to oxford and it has greatly changed this film features will geer as the sheriff he was later blacklisted it was the writers and actors of social dramas such as this film and grapes of wrath that were targets of the huac a few years later i don't recall if the actor playing the young boy claude jarman jr did anything after the tv series centennial 1978 but he was terrific in this earlier film and do not miss elizabeth patterson who later played in little women
<START> recently i borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie which took me three sessions over three days to get through that's another comment in the making br br but what i wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the dvd it included a game of memory which asks the player viewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark however every time it reveals the chosen animal the screen prompts the player to find or congratulates the player on finding it's mate this is a spelling error since it should be its mate as possessive pronoun not a for it is it is an annoying error to keep repeating 16 or more times to finish a game of course it's a kid's activity really but teaches kids incorrect spelling br br and oh yeah the game never changes it is the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time plus it doesn't keep score like the number of moves it took to solve the game so there is no lasting value or challenge to it it's just a feature to list on the packaging br br simply put there could have been more thought and care put into this special feature just like there could have been more thought and care put into this muddled film
<START> this must be the dumbest movie i've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award ok so it begins pretty good logical humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f rt ss stupidity that makes total sense the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it though i guess it is supposed to be funny with a very serious message after a moment of thought why i didn't laugh the answer was pretty clear this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be so it is extremely dumb yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes huh electrolytes this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience br br although they probably just laugh br br ah well nice try br br i am now editing well adding to my comment cause i read some of the other comments first i noticed some people see racism in this movie well that did not at all cross my mind when watching it however i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race but i think this is not the place to do so i wonder if we were to rate the family here would you complain about them all being black i don't think so but i guess you could aside from that from the 2 wisest people in the world half the woman doesn't seem totally caucasian to me so 'what the problem is ' br br secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings from 1's to 10's and everything in between but a lot of there which means the movie does its job very well it people up makes them want to speak about it and judge it that means it is a good movie whether you like it or hate it after 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even yet you keep watching this utter crap i guess you keep hoping that it isn't so or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents well this is one for sure
<START> it pays to watch reader's digest or time if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to mani to make this masterpiece based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents mr paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes cherishes as much as it and preaches as much as it practises br br where does one start the foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern sri lanka the chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer author and 3 adorably naughty children or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies whichever way one looks at it this film is worth being in your collection if you happen to like mani compelling dramas br br mr is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film he oozes class in adapting two real life stories into one i will not go into the story as it is better seen than read but what i will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why for all the war mongering that happens in this world it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hope br br innocence in its purity cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants it is an innocence of such nature that drives to seek her biological parents despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well resistance and finally when the twain do meet mother and daughter the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears aided by a background score from a r rahman the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the of hearts a list of questions that has to ask her biological mother in a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it a child discovers its mother alive in body but lost in spirit with the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her does to her adoptive mother what this film's title means a peck on the cheek br br as for the cast the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant ps mr has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from little known child artistes but this should take nothing away from for an award winning performance with an able supporting cast of indira and the stupendous nandita das she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in the music may be not as memorable as other rahman offerings but that still didn't stop him from garnering another national award for the best music direction is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature the dialogues are top class sample the touching exchange and indira have on the swing shortly after the revelation that she is not biological daughter and the cinematography superb br br this film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions do not judge it as a lesson in film making you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the mani a r rahman stable
<START> here is a movie of adventure determination heroism bravery plus it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting it's a wonderful adventurous storyline and alyssa milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome confident no nonsense fizzy a great role model this is one of my favorite movies it is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt not only is the storyline excellent but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed this movie is as good as gold
<START> this film is about the worst i have seen in a very long time terence stamp's talent is totally wasted and just about the only thing that i enjoyed was hearing a favorite song of mine if i had a million dollars by bnl in the opening credits br br ashton kutcher plays the main character a nice guy who gets roped into house sitting for his boss misadventures ensue blah blah blah if you have time to kill and having nothing better to do then this is the movie for you otherwise watch something else br br there are not necessarily any redeeming moments but it is nice to see molly shannon and jeffrey tambor on the screen they are always pleasures to watch though this film managed to even these bright spots
<START> woof pretty boring and they might as well have shot it in black and white it was so colorless br br the movie starts with rolling text explaining and asking whether god or satan is behind it there are some protests outside a lab some people rob a bank and many of the robbers and guards get shot the father of one of the robbers i think arranges to have his son frozen there's a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relate br br there's a power outage and the containing the frozen people get struck by lightning and they emerge as zombies they're all wearing silver like suits and their skin is dark green and wrinkled no idea why they look so bad being frozen evidently didn't preserve their looks and they have silver eyes they go around killing people sometimes lurching like zombies sometimes moving like normal people br br linda blair keeps showing up every once in a while to what purpose i'm not really sure i think her character works at the lab but she's not very important to the plot and her role is very small br br the movie ends with some freeze frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters next which are pretty silly
<START> taking its cues from backwoods classics deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre jeff just before dawn might not offer much very new in terms of maniac stalks and kills a group of still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director's deft handling of the material great use of the stunning scenery even greater use of women in hot pants a brooding synth score from brad and a nifty twist towards the end although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention br br thanks to solid performances from its capable oscar winner george kennedy as forest ranger roy is a sense of realism to just before dawn that is all too often missing from this kind of fare the film also offers a pretty creepy maniac who like dick dog and uses a nasty machete to kill and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its contemporaries a topless woman gratuitous nudity box well and truly ticked in a lake discovers that the hand that has been groping her underwater doesn't belong to her boyfriend and a shortsighted character makes out with his pal's girlfriend as a joke unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer
<START> this is a really great film it gets you thinking about your parents how we all have fragile relationships we all have with them unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people and just as important we should remember to open up and show them our real selves not just who we think they want us to be definitely see this documentary imdb is making me write more text before they will post my comment how odd usually online comments need to be short short and here i am being asked to write more well i went to see the film with my parents i thought afterward they would want to talk about their parents but my dad kept wanting to talk about himself and things in his life he feels he screwed up which was unusual my dad is not a reticent man but i was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes he thinks he made mike and kitty came to the film to do a q a and there was a hilarious moment afterward when my dad was talking with mike while my mom spoke with kitty really just disregard my last few sentences to pad this comment and just remember '51 birch street ' go see it
<START> okay i haven't read the book yet but i have to say that the lead character was miscast how can i say such a thing haven't read the book you ask it's simple as a viewer of this miniseries i grew irritated by the mannerisms gestures and look of the lead character fannie price it's one thing to be a good person but it's quite another to be a stick in the mud creature who disdains from looking anyone in the face or otherwise meeting their gaze apart from the overdone susan b anthony profile she seemed resolute in refusing to look at another person the scene where edmond is pouring his heart out to her she is looking straight ahead the whole time forcing him to do the same as a result it was just awkward and i just couldn't fathom anyone being in love with her let alone both henry and edmond many have said it was true to the book if that is the case i find it hard to believe that jane austen would create such a character as her lead heroine it's possible to create a character who has been put upon by others and succeeds in earning their trust and endearment but the portrayal of this character in this miniseries just didn't do it for me
<START> i fully agree with the previous reviewer there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr and the focus of the film is on their relationship hedy lamarr isn't at her best and spencer tracy appears to be naive simple and overly hopeful both in love and life an idealist role that played out best in town' if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station whoa it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast not the best acting on anybody's part miscast and mismatched story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself which is truly the best part of the film spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason
<START> life is too short to waste on two hours of hollywood nonsense like this unless you're a clueless 16 year old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do dull characters poor acting artificial emotion weak story slow pace and most important to this films flawed existence no one cares about the overly dramatic relationship
<START> the custer legend a la warner brothers epic there's no casting against type here with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute not only to custer but to the men of the 7th cavalry the story traces the life of the famed 'boy general from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates but this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood down beat ending and all this is great fun
<START> i love bad movies showgirls plan 9 from outerspace so on and this movie fits right in don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film it's downright awful tim accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian there's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the sign language there is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark there are people hopping up and down mt as if there were escalators installed on it this thing is laughably ridiculous so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor it is totally implausible i loved every minute of it
