<START> it is a damn good movie with some surprising twists a good cast and a great script only a couple of stupid bits like the rasta hit man scene this guy's a professional but that has been commented on already the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on made it even more entertaining this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast it sickens me that some movies get made whose budget equals the of a small country with a hyped up release good reviews an oscar winning director and or actors and turn out to be so disappointing with actors sleepwalking through their roles and uninspired directing with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big sandra bullock could drive a bomb loaded bus through it examples in my opinion are the terminal castaway matrix revolutions extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast especially who wears a rubber dress in one scene and a jacket with c nt on the back in large letters in another a sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses and please enough with the tarantino comparisons this did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies even if that is your opinion are we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one way no one can ever use the same ideas again get real this film has it's own style
<START> with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie but weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth this movie is high on story but low on character you never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick unfortunately weber has no idea what slapstick is all about his style could be described at hit and miss of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel weber directs his humor at this lot it is a shame how bad he uses good talent many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors
<START> to preface my remarks on the film i know the topic is horrendous and words can't adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the post horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them br br however this film doesn't really deal with in a horrific way except for the first 10 minutes some of the images there are horrifying and should be as a reminder what devastation nuclear weapons can produce seeing burned people walking around aimlessly or man combing his hair and of hair coming out etc is not a pretty sight br br but after the first dozen minutes this japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of hiroshima in the mid to late '40s i actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera br br almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one family's problems at that point this is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster it's simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about 1950 on whether one of the women was permanently damaged and if so should she marry br br this could have been a real impact film but it didn't go in that direction
<START> visitors is a hard hard movie to enjoy it's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times i was drifting off during the film this was about on a hot sunny day i might add not midnight on a cold winter evening so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is br br strange thing is it's not long at 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior darkwolf that i'd quite happily watched the day before it just drags an awful lot enough for you to lose interest br br when it's not mistaking s l o o w development for atmosphere visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen while the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out radha mitchell's boats woman the hauntings aliens whatever are actually quite creepy and effective especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night full marks for not make up all over the shop too the single person boat is a creepy place and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you br br still though i find it hard to recommend visitors i came out of it not only feeling like i'd just watched a 4 hour film not a 100 minute one but also feeling like i'd been cheated somehow as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings mind games real ghosts space aliens visitors doesn't pick one for definite all that watching radha mitchell talk to her cat and dominic purcell for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past for nothing say what you like about shyamalan but at least he tells you what happened however crazy stupid you might think it if you don't watch a lot of these movies your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat but i found this slow boring and highly derivative if you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter
<START> it's sometimes difficult to watch such self avowed message films from an earlier seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism the issue of racism and religious tolerance is one that has been drummed into us from an early age and as we've grown teachers and authority figures have sought out less blatant yet equally effective means of getting the message across 'the house i live in 1945 ' is about as unsubtle as message films come and frank sinatra seems to be treating his audience like a child Â indeed perhaps this was the point as the short was no doubt intended primarily to influence younger film goers even so i found myself curiously affected when sinatra launched into that sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be an and i'm not even an american released just two months after the end of wwii director mervyn leroy greeted war weary audiences with a message of tolerance togetherness and above all else hope the music ain't bad either br br fresh faced frank sinatra Â already a star but not yet the superstar he'd become Â opens the film in a recording studio booming out if you are but a dream with a full orchestral accompaniment when between songs frank goes outside for a he observes a large group of kids bullying a young jewish boy their taunts provoked purely by his differing religion ol' blue eyes quickly puts a stop to this childish behaviour delicately branding the bullies nazi werewolves and scolding their irrational prejudice he then earnestly and good lectures the group on the plain silliness of racial and religious discrimination assuring them that every american culture however it differs from our own is still american at unless of course you're one of those bloody japs there's a hint of hypocrisy in pleading for racial tolerance while presenting one nation as the collective enemy though you could hardly blame hollywood for being less than enthusiastic about the plight of the japanese in 1945 br br sinatra drives his point home with a wonderfully heartwarming rendition of the house i live in which was written in 1943 by abel when the songwriter first heard the song on film he was furious that the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses which he considered crucial to the message these omissions were most likely due to time restraints but understandably didn't take too kindly to them and reportedly had to be ejected from the cinema when it was first released 'the house i live in' was deemed such an important short film that it won a golden globe for best film for promoting international good will and a honorary oscar for all involved in 2007 it was judged to be culturally historically or aesthetically significant and added to the library of national film registry which is how i came to hear of it while its approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young fella named frank sinatra
<START> jaded offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question when is rape not rape unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly jaded is lame stuff only for the bleary eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama

<START> alfred hitchcock made this comedy of mis marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it carole lombard and robert montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love it doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why the jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel and the leads are uncharismatic lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later robert montgomery seems to know he's in a sow's ear and tries his to make a silk purse out of it without much success the best performance comes from gene raymond as 'the other man' he has a lovely drunk scene this is one of the few really bad hitchcock films
<START> spoilers edgar rice famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen til one's thirst is quenched notably during the thirties and the forties by hollywood its made tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters several years later hugh hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey man and it's a more natural more wild and more down to earth tarzan that he gives away here hudson skilfully avoids the clichÃ©s that you usually grant to tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet cheetah not only are we far from the designed and invented character made by hollwood but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories the movie was partly made in africa more precisely in cameroon the movie introduces two obvious parts the first one which takes place in the jungle where tarzan lives among his adoptive friends the apes and considers himself as their lord but he ignores his real origins the second one in england where tarzan discovers the english society ian holm epitomizes the link between the two parts and hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay indeed holm teaches lambert basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the english society and the result works moreover in the second part no one ever laughs at tarzan and he's even really appreciated as far as the end is concerned well it's a both bitter and happy end happy because tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives but bitter too because this homecoming means that the greystoke line won't be ensured and is condemned to disappear christophe lambert finds here his first and last great role sadly he'll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he'll play in poor and action movies nevertheless as i said previously a clever screenplay a performance of a rare quality some impressive natural sceneries both the jungle and the english country and we get a gorgeous movie it's also an excellent from a popular novel so why is it only rated barely 6 10
<START> as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing this is not br br a film cue dramatic music br br it's just a so bad it's good totally surreal jackie chan stunt for all the women fighters are totally kick butt and jackie is definitely put in his place br br this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon surrounded by munchies ready to roar with laughter cheer on the good guys boo the bad guys and continually yell what when something totally bizarre happens great fun
<START> this is easily my favourite film a tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush sheer brilliance br br i'd love to see some more of gilles work but at least according to imdb he hasn't made any other features has the high quality of this work made producing another too daunting a task has he moved back into some other sphere of creative endeavour i certainly hope this won't be his final feature but i can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films
<START> this musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few the wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly br br this music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises it is about a land far away from it all where living things have room to grow its people are living and growing together mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age br br the lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this world that is spinning around and to look inside yourself that is where the truth always lies the absolute level of consciousness is more real than the ever changing world of the senses br br i have been searching for the video for years when i find it or it comes out in dvd it will help share the joy of being in shangri la again burt music and hal david's lyrics made a masterpiece in turbulent times that is just now ready to be fully appreciated br br may this cd inspire you to find your own lost horizon or recognize it when peace of mind has found you org
