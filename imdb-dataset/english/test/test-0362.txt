<START> this movie is so bad there are not words to describe it if i got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this the plot is so dull and it is not even worth mentioning the best part of the movie was when the credits and i got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was james bond iii just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap
<START> antonio margheriti director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror cannibal apocalypse helms this gothic flavoured giallo starring gap toothed 70s icon jane birkin as well as her massive french lover of the day serge gainsbourg br br unfortunately despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bi sexual french teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan seven deaths in the cat's eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure br br pretty schoolgirl birkin returns to her family's scottish estate after many years away only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks hidden doorways dark corridors creepy graveyards candlelit cobweb covered rooms margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings on but ends up with a lame cop out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme br br 'and where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this ' i hear you ask well a rather pudgy witnesses each murder thus justifying margheriti's rather cool sounding title br br stylish fun' claims the dvd cover pile of says i
<START> i don't mean to sound pretentious here but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves this movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred and not in the good artsy way of offending this film becomes the archetype for painful dialogue delivered by even more pathetic actors
<START> it's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters but immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters the fly over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon the all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from jp 1 and 2 the story line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated this gave me with no option but to award the film 3 10
<START> some people drift through life moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye others latch on to a cause another person or a principle and remain adamant committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but we're all different made of different clay ' as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one committed and obsession in committed ' starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is and this is her story br br admittedly has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general she's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson it's forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and days into the marriage he's gone off to himself and figure it all out when realizes he's not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe it's because of that she's made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space' and not even letting him know she's there she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma ' and it's her job to keep a spiritual over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local ' alfonso who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes and takes a fancy to her for it's a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself br br there's a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from point of view as krueger makes us privy to thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling there's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life br br heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it's all a part of the character she creates there's an appeal to that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out she's a likable agreeable person and because you've shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is it's a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so to life br br as carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life br br overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as brother jay goran visnjic alfonso and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character br br the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art new york car thief dylan baker carl's editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture reflecting upon who we are where we're going and what we really need is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking 8 10
<START> julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson while on an assignment for germany br br the songs are beautiful the two are well paired julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays br br a half german half english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i julie sings some endearing mancini songs br br i loved the film some will say it's a chick flick but so what it's wonderful br br supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped it may not be up to rock's performance in pillow talk magnificent obsession or giant br br blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i type planes were used in the film scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous
<START> when i first got wind of this picture it was just called shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put back into chances of doing theatrical i was very well excited about the whole piece br br by the time it was titled the shepherd border patrol i was tap dancing in excitement for this flick with isaac at the helm of directing and jj perry pulling stunt coordination i almost peed me pants in anticipation pics were released of kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as scott adkins playing what i thought was the villain and i was mind blown in excitement i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf br br then it came out i ordered it off blockbuster online for 20 and was ready for anything the reviews from net kinda had my ideas alittle altered but i braced myself the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package my initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard packaging then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player however i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film br br by the time it was over i was cool as a fool in the pool the shepherd is certainly one of my all time favorite direct to video films ever and makes derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is sure some of the fights ran a twee bit short but they were still very awesome the shootouts were superb as was scott adkins who should have been the villain unlike the forgettable steven lord br br i highly recommend this flick seriously
<START> i was really excited when i read the ghost would be shown on tv however i was deeply disappointed i loved the original story written by oscar wilde and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie
<START> a few things to touch on as a response to the earlier person's comment you just have to pay attention to what is going on in the film br br i guess they are spoilers br br the red stuff under david's mouth poison ivy the wife says not to scratch it or else it will spread br br david goes insane because the stranger is telling him to get out of the house which probably proves david's theory of an affair happening between the wife and stranger he runs after the man br br david does not lose him in the woods he simply hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to pick up the pieces br br only the wife eats the mushroom br br i must say after that one point with the wife and stranger i began to feel disappointed but the ending made up for the entire film br br and for that and the very last scene this is one of my favorite movies ever i should have put it together earlier but let myself get sidetracked i was really surprised honestly br br this film is interesting to say the least but if you are not watching this for the performances that the actors give i'd say you better let this one go because that is all that keeps this certain film together
<START> mild spoilers below br br the prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when was filmed from the opening scene of european refugees to the final prediction that naziism will be the death of millions of germans this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after pearl harbor there isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it the rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the herr coburn with a pretty bad accent and daughter assimilating into america with wayne's help other than the dust bowl scenes the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight coburn's speech comparing naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the then current successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and dr played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant nazis justifying their actions br br when viewed from a historical perspective some aspects of are interesting if you look at it for entertainment outside of the wwii perspective you'd have to say this is one of wayne's less successful efforts
<START> i find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs that a charlatan and fraud of caliber as a charlatan he is exceptional there is no denying he had a special gift it's a pity he misused it though for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity this movie presents an idealized version of own largely fictional and fantastic account of his formation and awakening which i would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people see it if you dare to have a disagreeable eye opening about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders to the extent that a clown like could inspire such devotion and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of christianity as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretenses of a dysfunctional cult
<START> this is the kind of film they used to make amusing heart warming troubling authentic with convincing performances by people without nose jobs boob jobs eye jobs in other words real people macdonald plays the female love interest and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least imagine that a real girl in a movie whatever next hollywood would hate her because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in tinseltown this story has the same hilarious feel as sandy mackendrick's classic 'whisky with the humour of remote scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee from time to time the actual intervals between those times often being rather short director stephen whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right and it is shocking to discover that he died before his film's release aged only 56 which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen ulrich thomsen does very well at playing a german rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to in the isle of harris to build a small rocket to carry postal between the islands there he falls in love with the alluring macdonald lass and she reciprocates the affection some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale and the film is pure delight there is of course the threat of imminent war with hitler and we learn that hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war which is a shocking statistic tragic love is never far from view but lips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the end this film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in britain should be making but are they being properly released in a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality tv shows where repulsive have become the national heroes is there even a market anymore for a film like this after all there is no grunting sex there are no close ups of wounds or of anyone's genitals there are no drugs taken there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence anyone who is looking for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film
<START> a movie that tries hard to say something and generally fails like the fatuous academics that populate the movie it meanders aimlessly substituting endless it seems like forever listening to it conversation for some action or plot direction br br sadly it's one of the best examples of canadian cinema i've seen
<START> coltrane and idle are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery they hide out in a nunnery school and disguise themselves appropriately to avoid detection from the mob and the police alot of catholic humor and slapstick but the script is kinda thin as are the laughs there is a good shower scene though on a scale of one to ten 4
<START> one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichÃ©s and predictable twists this is not prison break or any other show actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for children's profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show they're all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan o'reilly and tobias because they're so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the don't have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing show the best one out there forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz
