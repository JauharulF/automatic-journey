<START> i am a guy so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that richard gear likes to be in tear jerker movies i would rather watch action adventure sci fi i was right the movie is definitely a tear jerker diane tended to over act a few times as did richard but they brought it around and made it work the daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude so you started out hating her the movie is way too predictable but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece go rent it see if you don't shed a tear lol if you like the notebook you will love this one the beach scenes were immaculately shot even though the hurricane scenes were a little off sequence it was still a bit to watch them react to it
<START> the first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up to predictable and the worst scenario i've seen won't and hopefully i din't buy it also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did suck even more all i want to say to the people who make this is don't do whole episode about space because they suck the point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before gets worse from season to season i got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this only people who are brain washed can watch this crap seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do
<START> okay where to begin did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team shields and bet ya didn't but they turned it down complaining about robot make up then they faded off into obscurity now this movie has everything a crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty harry lots of cool robots it's funny it's touching it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci fi and romantic comedies it's the first robot romantic comedy now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues but there are very minor and can be overlooked i think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over again 9 stars
<START> it is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house br br copies of most episodes are available but are usually of poor quality being copies of copies of copies br br as i understand it 92 episodes were produced during its run but only 15 are noted here br br some of the series writers such as richard matheson went on to become noted authors br br excellent series well written well staged and well produced br br michael br br thailand
<START> you know before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases i mean if they were arrested and charged they must have been guilty i reasoned br br i formed this opinion over some years you see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of sydney he frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to heart' lawyers and magistrates he would bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be back on the street by noon it took its toll they wore him down he quit br br he has argued since not unreasonably i thought that creative evidence gathering to keep the baddies where they belong was well acceptable br br my arguments about the rights of innocent people weren't valid he claimed what are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime he would argue and being a law abiding citizen the weight of his argument convinced me he was right the chances of me or any of my family or friends being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none i thought br br hmmmmm well as mentioned earlier seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that br br i'm sending him a copy
<START> i am giving this movie vampire assassins a 2 rating mainly because it had no sex or nudity other than that i am not sure why it was ever made it was more like a training exercise in how to make a movie with a very limited budget the characters derek and slovak were the best actors they were followed closely by the biker dude with the pants and silver belt he was ok too most of the movie was filmed in some kind of distribution warehouse if you got tired of watching the kung fu kick boxing stunts you can check out the packages of scott tissue windex and other cleaning products you will have a lot of time to do this trust me i almost started to make a list the dialogue and kung fu stunts were extremely slow they talked slow fought slow etc i don't know why at least with the extra slow delivery of the actors lines you could hear everything very distinctly i am trying hard to find good stuff to say about this movie we watched it all the way to the end to see if got any better but it didn't we never could decide if the actors really knew martial arts or were just acting like they knew martial arts you can watch yourself and decide my favorite line was something like vampire speaking what are you looking at other man responding your bad dental work
<START> i have been a rabid star trek fan since 1966 still am one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters encounter at fails in its mission br br superbly produced br br poorly directed written acted d c fontana really blew this one this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned br br the first half of the first season didn't fare much better
<START> i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it i also like madonna's character and i do not agree that she played herself she has created a character and a sympathetic one br br my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love the humour in the film has a slightly touch and perhaps it is not everybody's cup of tea but it's their problem not of the film br br i found this film wholesome and sunny in fact the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day and madonna can act just take off your glasses of negative thinking
<START> what an awesome film i came out of the theatre feeling stunned the film that i had just seen was one of the best films i have seen in my life i had my eyes glued to the screen it's very symbolic visually lush beautifully shot and gorgeously told it's basically about two people who move into a flat and live next door to each other with there partners who are assumed to be having an affair with each others partners assuming this our two heroes act out what they think their partners are getting upto there is an obvious repression of feelings for each other with the use of camera work body language and it's a visual feast and hard not to like some of the story gets slightly confusing but that's nothing the ending is one of the most beautiful and anti hollywood endings i have ever seen in my life and visually amazing the films haunting score adds to the mood i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and respect what a superb film
<START> sherlock holmes basil rathbone begins this story in disguise helping to smuggle famous physicist dr franz william post out of and under the watchful eye of the nazis who want his bomb sight plans the allies obviously want it too and sherlock is there to help dr has invented an instrument which greatly aids in the accuracy of aerial bombardment br br holmes and dr arrive safely back at baker street but the scientist would rather be alone for some mysterious reason although he had promised the english to help them not the germans he stays true to that promise but there are some desperate moments for holmes and the english along the way br br it's an entertaining film and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises he needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch rival professor moriarity one complaint if moriarity was that evil he would have dispensed with holmes without batting an instead of giving him openings to escape it's pretty sad too when the usual dim witted dr watson nigel bruce has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times br br yes there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times it's a fun film to watch and it looks beautiful thanks to the great restoration job done on this dvd it makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals particularly the night time shots br br one other note whoever did the english subtitles in here misspelled or misinterpreted at least a half dozen words it's very sloppy work and not the first time i've encountered this watching the entire series on the restored dvd set
<START> you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century el is it manos the hands of fate is the worst movie of all time but el certainly is the worst movie of this century it also has to have the distinction of having the absolute worst leading actor ever eric alegria the actor in the lead role has never done another film other than el gee i wonder why br br apparently the monster is attacking people but everyone that is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid and there are no cops at all in this town just two idiot detectives hello cops show up on the scene of homicides first then the detectives come and apparently the monster only attacks in one person's backyard and some deserted area by the docks or thats the only places the filmmakers could get access to film br br this 'film' is the reason why imdb must allow us to give negative stars this easily deserves 10 stars or at least 0 they should allow a 0 rating
<START> there is absolutely no doubt that this version of tarzan is the closest to burroughs' vision while he gladly collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales the film studios' ludicrous obsession with casting olympic swimmers as tarzan was beyond laughable i guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on shot br br prior to this film the most faithful adaptations were in comic strips and comic books as fine as some of these were we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he had been created
<START> i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it but it has grown on me i love the costumes and poses the actors make the humor the cinematography the soundtrack the scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly every time i watch it there is something new that catches my eye aaliyah as is probably the only thing that ruins it but not enough br br also the lestat in this movie is different it is not the same character you can see that the character armand has been given lestat like qualities because i'm assuming anne wanted it in but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books it's a fascinating by itself
<START> i have watched farscape from first episode to now and i will continue to watch it the setting and the characters are amazing and the plots are great the show really keeps me on the edge of my seat and when the show goes off after an hour i keep hoping it will be another hour
<START> atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic boyer is a french thief hiding in the of algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out meanwhile he falls for lamarr and tries to find a way to escape the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere reminiscent of casablanca in some ways it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman it's all talk talk talk with endless scenes of boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and boyer wooing lamarr in the shadows personally i didn't care for boyer's character for a minute so the tension was utterly nonexistent br br stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as boyer's henchmen guys who clearly do not belong in algiers sigrid is the wildly overacting jealous girlfriend of boyer his brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with lamarr br br especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured it sounds exciting too bad we didn't see it for ourselves the ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending that doesn't stop it from being sappy
