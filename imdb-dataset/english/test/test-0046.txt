<START> you were on your way up and you tripped on a skirt gilligan says to jim leonard that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard a young humphrey bogart when his dream gets sidetracked by the bombshell heiress carol played by dorothy leonard has been working on a new and improved motor but now his love life and motor company both have their ups and downs in this 68 minute bogart hadn't developed the quiet brooding style yet good performances by most of the supporting characters her butler his co workers a sister interlopers along the way some adult themes since it was done just before they really enforced the film code but it's still tame compared to what is on tv today directed by thornton a year before directed the incredible flying down to rio
<START> i've spent a year deployed in iraq and amongst the hundreds of movies i've seen here was this little gem called vampire assassin judging from the cover african american with corn rows with a curved blade leather coat and the demeanor of a badass i expected a blade rip off fair enough br br so i pop it in and observed a overweight african american with no blade no cornrows and well nothing at all really except i don't know if you've read any of these other reviews you get the gist of the flick it sucks bad really bad br br i don't know if it was the highlander esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire or the karate kick sound effects for camera zooms or the twenty dollar budget on props or the ok we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a johnson johnson parking lot or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast paced as two old people having sex or the 7th grade acting talent or the eccentric asian master who's either or on acid or what but the movie manages to force you to question your existence and that's awesome br br not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners if you heckle or mst3k with your friends this is the flick for you i've seen it three times already and i think it might've caused permanent damage on my psyche if you still don't have any clue as to the quality of the film people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it not even by force br br long story short watch it either as masochistic pleasure or punishment it will rock your skull and for the most part for all the wrong reasons
<START> for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character detective made an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is bayless of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv
<START> eleven years ago stanley released his true inner self and became the hero of edge city by finding and wearing the norse god of mischief mask the mask helped bring jim carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun everyone knew how to spell party p a r t y why cuz i gotta now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie son of the mask someone asked director lawrence why are you making this and he responds cuz i gotta unfortunately that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing son of the mask i still left the theatre thinking good lord why and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party br br the son of the mask begins with otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner tim avery a clear homage to legendary loony toons creator tex avery tim played by jamie kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one day draw for on the night of the company halloween party tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect after the party tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in tom and jerry type mayhem to out the baby meanwhile loki played by alan cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father odin br br first off ill admit that i do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as tom and jerry and loony toons with its wile e coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot however this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time br br the premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying the characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny the dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much cgi was used one of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on jim carrey and his exuberant style of just being jim carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon jamie kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift the baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie the side story of loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying br br the son of the mask is a sad sad state of affairs what i suggest is you go rent or buy the original the mask and thank the norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us and will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as i continue to ask the infamous question why the son of the mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of loony toons and jim carrey who will always be in my book the mask
<START> loved this movie great acting by carla interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong don't they all some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible it was a totally unexpected delight more quentin ish than most films try to be
<START> the plot is simple an american couple is in vacation in thailand somehow they are attacked by the chinese vampires and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires this is ok till now the girl's partner is left to search for her and now the horror begins he comes upon a strange group of semi vampires or something they only drank animal blood these vampires are in conflict with the bad guy for about 800 years however with the help of the 'good vampires' the guy begins to search his girlfriend br br now the fight scenes begin what a karate movie without fight another thing i have noticed is that the vampires are very ugly guys i mean a vampire is an old fashion guy he is alive since for ever he's got style there are also modern vampires but in this movie the vampires are weird like come on they ride a bike they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their way br br the worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie it is an low budget one the script is boring and the actors aren't too talented the music is pretty good but the effects are not that great br br to sum up the movie it is not that great but if you have a free afternoon watch it and tell me if i'm right or not
<START> i have long tried to understand why people like shakespeare so much and every few years i give him another go i was hoping that this play film my 6th different shakespeare play would unlock the lucky casket and marry me to the riches of this literary demigod bah i clearly chose the wrong key br br once the phrase pound of flesh had been uttered 10 minutes into the film the main parts of the plot were transparent which grinds along with a languid script and lifeless acting at every step the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance the concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is incredulous it is no surprise who wins the matrimonial jackpot because a main protagonist in the play and he's the third man to try and there are three caskets to choose from and his friend risks his life to pay the dowry the only genuine surprise that i had watching this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case however as soon as the ring treachery began it was immediately apparent what would transpire br br ok so i know that millions of you love shakespeare not for the surprise in the well known stories but for the depth and passion of the characters but i felt nothing for the characters rather than gripped with suspense and admiration during the court scene i sat there hoping that it would be over soon please br br one day i might just find a shakespeare play that does something other than bore me
<START> i'm very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here while it had some good features for the most part i found this movie to be heavy handed predictable and worst of all not in the least bit scary the first 30 minutes of the movie were promising the actress did a nice job in her portrayal and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful unfortunately from there the movie entered into a downward spiral i went into this movie with no clue as to what it would be about didn't know anything about the actors directors genre etc at a certain point my wife made the comment is this supposed to be a scary movie well i suppose so as the boiler plate horror movie score full of squeaking violins and extended vibrato could mean nothing else there didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment and the second half of the movie descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous a movie like this walks a dangerously narrow path and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path or to jump off and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all for the final 30 minutes i chose the latter
<START> one of the most successful shows in television history is back now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all but the new show is impressive br br sci fi has premiered the first two episodes rose and the end of the world this weekend we meet rose a twenty something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor using the internet she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes death follows when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time traveling in a tardis disguised a 50s style police call box br br she helps him save the world there wouldn't be a show otherwise and decides to join him but when he puts her life in danger he is distraught and questions whether her company was worth the risk br br although the special effects are kinda lame and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy doctor who is after two episodes aired in the us a smart well written work apparently the second season has already aired in the uk so i predict the same success here
<START> dirty dancing one of my most favorite movies i've only watched it two times on abc because i haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from blockbuster i had no idea jennifer grey was 27 at the time she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager compared to some women in hollywood she has a very flat chest which is why i was fooled so easily about her age so both physically and emotionally grey pulls off playing a teen very well i also loved the dancing who wouldn't both times i've watched dirty dancing i keep wanting to look up dance classes i also love the soundtrack and i do recognize some of the songs from when i was eight or nine i would love to be able to watch this in my drama class and i'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes it's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year and the ending was absolutely fantastic that's one of the best moments in the film br br i can't believe i'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of dirty dancing who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title
<START> created in 1928 and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name because his wife convinced him mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it is in fact his third but it doesn't matter for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and minnie mouse missing the boat being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them mickey helps her crank it's tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until pete comes along again to stop him making mickey peel potatoes mickey mouse was number 53 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons and he was number 31 on the 100 greatest cartoons very good
<START> it's amazing that such a cliche ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place the characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired that it's impossible to care about any of them especially brooke shields the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible if you like this genre you'd be better off renting singles or bodies rest motion
<START> br br when i first heard about this back in 1997 over coffee with friends i decided to check it out the only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local cinema's br br that didn't stop the enjoyment of seeing a simply great movie with a top notch cast in aidan quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley the whole movie kept me glued to my seat br br i simply found no flaws in this great movie i give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers i am very proud to have this in my collection br br 10 10 i don't hand this out lightly
<START> if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed action scenes there are plenty if you are both blind and deaf i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen and it does appear that there was some money spent on it talk about throwing money away as an editor i would hope that the editor s of this movie never again be allowed to edit a film book or even a post it note as a writer i would hope that the author s never again be allowed near even a broken crayon you would think that i am not recommending that you view this movie not so tape it so you may stop your pain when you need to and educate yourself as to how bad a movie can be
<START> in nineteen eighty two when it was announced that the was going to be made there was a storm of controversy this was an event which still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the australian people after some changes listen out for the well timed telephones ringing to disguise names the dismissal went to air it was nothing short of brilliant the leads were perfect max phipps as gough lead the way closely followed by john stanton as malcolm fraser and the evergreen john as sir john kerr the time was created well the feelings of the people were well done and the political elements were not two dimensionally made into melodrama as in so many american series the dismissal was a faithful re creation of a time in australia which some would rather forget and which we cannot forget it did not take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides it leaves one wanting to maintain the rage and change the constitution which still allows for this to all happen again the dismissal is now available on dvd in australia watch it learn from it and learn about our modern history
