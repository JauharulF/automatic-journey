<START> the thing that's truly terrifying about this is that the filmmakers thought they were making something intelligent and sexy instead they made probably the stupidest horror picture of the year br br this movie starts with a bunch of art snob friends at a gallery this trashy european weirdo walks up and starts talking pretentious to the main character sounding like he just walked out of an episode of dark shadows he then offers her up some stick to smoke yes a freakin' stick which she eagerly agrees he picks off some red crap and puts it in a spoon for her to if this ever happens to you in real life don't do it br br she's transported to some weird wannabe jean rollin netherworld that's supposed to be sexy but isn't where there's this thing that looks like a rotted creature from the black lagoon br br soon she turns all her artsy sleazeball friends onto her new form of supernatural crack no matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue they can't leave it the hell alone at one point she even makes out with the rotten creature br br after the final battle and the stupid woman is vaporized or whatever the so called hero is left alone to pack up his copy of michael moore's dude where's my country and can't resist smoking that stick one more time to try to rescue his moron lady friend what a dope br br rates four stars for sheer unintentional humor
<START> distributor goodtimes home video br br plot a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie gail osborne is new in town she makes friends has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting after more and more phone calls she is raped throughout most of the movie she tries to find proof that the person did rape her br br audio video this 1987 vhs edition from goodtimes stinks there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen br br extras no extras from goodtimes home video br br final thoughts this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978 so don't expect many deaths there are none if you can find this movie with the home video logo on the front then buy it but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy this can be a little boring but if you are patient the ending is pretty good
<START> caddyshack ii does no justice for the thin plot thin actors exception of randy quaid the only thing that is decent with this movie is the soundtrack maybe this movie should have been destroyed when the script was written
<START> pepe le pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet either way you can't help feeling a little awe on beholding this classic wb character this personally believes that pepe was the inspiration behind other would be animated casanovas today from cartoon network's johnny bravo to disney's lumiere from beauty and the beast br br his unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a distance from all his victims br br in this particular cartoon a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk all goes well until pepe arrives and promptly pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly enthusiastic love making br br the groundwork for pepe's many trademarks are laid in this cartoon from his adorable love calls to that aggravatingly calm hop chase of his br br this cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned the most ardent can go the distance and have his beloved pig eon leaving dust trails behind them
<START> john carpenter's the thing is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made sadly as with most carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic it seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the good alien an idea spawned after the success of i t and the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy human ignorance is truly a frightening thing people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be br br the thing itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a u s antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being refered throughout the movie only as a thing able to imitate any form of life not knowing who might or might not be the creature we see how every character reacts to the situation there is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be not quite human br br carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average sci fi horror there are no whats behind you jumping moments here instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to rob impressive creature effects he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films br br instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach by implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret ate what has transpired in certain scenes while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies br br ennio morricone's score works all the way it's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone although i've always wondered how would it have sounded if carpenter he has been known to compose all of his except this one did it characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially kurt russel who plays the down out apathetic helicopter pilot r j macready its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie from his don't give a attitude in the beginning to that of a and leader of the group of men who try to fight the thing but even with that said there are no false heroics here there are no laughing at the face of death moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last speaking of which here once again carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending br br quarter of a century after its release the thing doesn't feel dated and with the disturbingly growing use of computer generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or time a masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten
<START> ramin sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of ale alejandro and his friend were coming from the two of them get on a subway and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyone's attention for a moment and that they are selling candy bars or m m's or something and then they proceed to sell some bars if you as i have ever been on a subway in new york city at any time this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost don't notice it often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind focus isn't necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america it is subsequently in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking usually at once br br to compare it to pixote or the bicycle thief isn't too far of a leap actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other though is specific in his intentions in his documentary style we care about this character ali no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him but it's not simply because we're force fed any clichÃ©s aside from you know a brother and sister more so the brother trying to take care of one another makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration ali has the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and can operate themselves br br it's all ali is working for but what shows us in brutal detail is this work what ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping off of tires from cars in shea stadium or at one point stealing a purse in a desperate moment this makes it all the more serious an issue when ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road he doesn't mention it and pushes it aside but its always something that adds to the tension something ale wants to protect his sister from it adds to the tragedy when ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit maker a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes br br one could look immediately at the fact that ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in naturally as with a work of neo neo realism lets just call it realism featuring practically all non professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets but is focused more so on the here and the now and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt not a trace of melodrama is in the film barely even music accompaniment aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and radios sometimes will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes like the way ale is awake but acts like he's asleep the first night after he witnesses late night tryst and we see as she into bed she probably knows he's awake but neither can say a word or in a lot of other scenes poetic touches that seem seamless like when the man shows ale how feeding the pigeons work br br it's rough and gritty as you can expect and it doesn't give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about it's also a superbly shot hand held film where the technique as with a lot of movies made in its urban set tone and approach informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what they're doing but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy the filmmaker has a superb 'real life' cast ale was plucked from a nyc public school without any experience and knows how to not waste a shot while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows it's not city of god or pixote it's its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to or a first one barely on our way in a city such as new york if you're not moved by ale and his daily struggles i don't know what to do for you
<START> so keira knightly is in it so automatically we compare this film to aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is these films are totally different br br the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team br br if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined br br this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief br br there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly ind yourself moved br br go on give it a go
<START> as you may remember i have seem all three of the trilogy of trash and the first movie is the only one even remotely close to be watchable part two was low grade sewage and this installment is slightly better then two but still one steaming pile of something i removed from my backyard last monday the premise doesn't make sense why did the moonshiners murder that poor old lady and even in 1921 i think someone would notice a bunch of oily guys where a sweet little old lady once lived second that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first movie it's just old clothes and a burlap sack let's face it the series is garbage and should be forgotten about the noose
<START> with so many good movies coming out in 1995 particularly mortal kombat and seven unfortunately there had to be some bombs as well and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring predictable plot and a lousy ending it seems that antonio banderas hasn't been able to find a decent script since desperado the only remarkable film he's done anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who stalker was from the beginning her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but muddle an already paper thin story pity that dennis miller was wasted in this film this part resembles his eerily similar role in the net br br the convoluted ending had me shaking my head as i pretty much did throughout the entire movie plus any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form no matter how fake it looks automatically gets the thumbs down from me br br to make a long story short if you want to enjoy a good thriller then avoid this at all costs never talk to strangers especially those who recommend this movie 2 10
<START> i am proud of mike has said he should be because this film which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors works on many levels br br yes it's unconventional to many frustrating it's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt you figure it out br br you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first than to entertain that the monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make head is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture despite where your head's at get one thing straight head is not the monkees tv show br br so what we have here is a psychedelic documentary about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject head is a movie that could only come from those inside the box by 1968 the cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment the movie was a deliberate attempt at market so it did three things make a film the way the monkees envisioned most importantly reinvent the group to one not subservient to it's old bosses and yas hipper than before make a film that exposed american attitudes of information dissemination br br head therefore really is about media manipulation and its net result deception the mass media is supposed to inform educate us on the happenings in the world at large and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased otherwise how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book newspaper or tv show in one of the street interviews in head a guy admits i haven't looked at a newspaper or tv in years is he lesser or better the man even the drug parallels are a soft of things are not as they seem remember the old joke everything you know is wrong the screenplay starts with the public admission of it's own manufactured image and runs with the football literally is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind head is the film a stream of consciousness exercise is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise my guess is that head is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended br br largely the insiders responsible for head seem to enjoy themselves in the that take place in the film but there is anger anger at the chaos that characterized the late '60s and anger at the way the media television especially had changed culture in negative ways drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are but the producers of head want you to know that poor information is a far greater danger br br wars have been attributed to and lies what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv repeatedly the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly all of us as well in one scene peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone and is asked by a fellow monkey what's wrong i bought this ice cream cone and i don't want it the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform but to sell en mass blindly head goes further put any idea into someone's head and merrily goes he br br the filmmakers know this and the danger is real head is either a movie that creates itself as we go along or is a deliberate statement perhaps perhaps not maybe it is just pot meets advertising as critics scathed in 1968 the jokes are on the monkees and us be careful what you ask for you may get it br br cheers a true guilty pleasure very funny intelligent will please the fans find the substance it's there unabashedly weird bizarre collection of characters good length is appropriate lots of great one liners including my all time prophetic favorite the tragedy of your times my young friends is that you may get exactly what you want br br caveats dated drugs no plot no linear delivery of any thought in particular at least twenty five stories that interweave in stop and go fashion so may easily frustrate may seem pretentious to some people who can't stand the monkees need not watch though that in itself is no reason to avoid it the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt out eyeballs br br match cut
<START> i have for years remembered a song just a couple in a castle no twenty moonbeam square just a couple in castle in the air i couldn't find the song but i remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs i located a reference to the movie on the web i had seen the movie when i was only 9 year old at the pa theatre i was pleased to find that it had kenny gardner the singer with guy i am a lombardo fan and then to see that it was produced by the fleisher bros who did another very good full cartoon feature of travels also remembered fondly also the songs were associated with carmichael and frank loesser who are among the very best no wonder i remembered the film the song and the colorful animation as a full musical this is a movie which should be remembered as a one of the best of the early full musicals now that i remember it the plot may not have been earth shaking but was very well presented and makes for a easy to watch delightful movie
<START> george burns returns as the almighty after enjoying a big success with 1977's oh god an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil driven thrillers to comedic redemption although it made money the original was more in line with the topper comedies of the '30s than a return to feel good religious cinema here god appears to a young girl who had earlier starred in a stage production of annie and asks her to spread his divine word causing her nothing but trouble from grown ups in the process peculiar family oriented film appears to be warm hearted enough and burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes but the writing is half slapstick and half seriousness with the adults of the piece considering putting little away all of which makes god seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend is another problem a perky kid with wizened little eyes she is untrained for screen acting and occasionally seems awkward the medium budget production has a tv movie appearance with few graceful touches the final scene mimics the climax of the first oh god in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix which is welcomed it's the most subtle moment in the movie from
<START> fate puts a pair of priceless items in ernest's hands and he gets kidnapped and taken to africa because of it this was my first ernest film so i can't compare it to his others but i thought it was fairly amusing good stuff if you like slapstick humor and plain old clowning around
<START> a competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of jack lemmon and walter matthau i suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two grumpy old men films as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team ups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years the idea is a sure fire one matthau a bumbling gambler who's thousands of dollars in debt his unsuspecting friend lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies the catch is they've been signed on as dance hosts and matthau can't dance br br out to sea is a funny film and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of lemmon and matthau i found brent spiner best known as data from star trek the next generation to be very humorous as the snobby ball busting dance coordinator as the prissy boss of the two aging actors he manages to match them in the laughs department though the film doesn't really need any there's also a a love story or two to be found here as well involving dyan cannon who looks pretty fine for her years
<START> going into this movie i knew two things about it i knew that it was a real extreme flick and i knew that it was somewhat artsy both appeal to me in their own right but when placed together it can be something truly unique and this was damn right without a doubt unique like i said above it is an artsy film the way they used some intense sound it reminded me a lot of an aronofsky film visually i haven't seen anything like it the cinematography and lighting were done very well the movie seriously uses visuals and sounds better than anything i've seen in a while especially when you consider the experience these young filmmakers had couple 20 year olds you really have to take your hat off to them br br the movie isn't easy to describe or even discuss there isn't an actual storyÂ you could say it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control your think it's four segments or four ideas brought alive through visual and auditory extremes there is some talking hear and there but it's mostly a non speaking film br br the first segment is the shortest and it revolves a naked body and an eyeball try and guess what wrong the second segment is my favorite it involves a brother and a sister who looks a little like sarah silverman but with bigger boobs the brother is crazy and the sister is somewhat of a whore i would say this is the most extreme of all the segments and the most well made the gore effects in this one were great the third segment revolves around a bunch of naked people it up with mother earth it's probably considered the weakest of the bunch but still is smart and well made the fourth segment is probably the strongest of the film and i'd also say the deepest for myself i'll have to view this a couple times to understand what's truly being said i know that it tackles christianity in a way that would most likely make your mother feint or throw give it a try br br subconscious cruelty was recommended to me and i'm proud to say this is now in my movie collection it's extreme violent gory very sexual and surprisingly pretty damn thought provoking the next line i'm about to say has been used in almost every review i've read for this film this movie is not for everyone now ain't that the truth if you're into extreme films and or you're just a lover of film that wants to see something check this out 8 1 2 outta 10
