<START> as everyone knows by now 15 park avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half sister br br the manifestation of schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored there are also those who however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence i think ms sen deserves a lot of praise for 15 park avenue she has done a good turn not only to the general public but also to those who deal with schizophrenics relatives social workers psycho analysts the film actually helps in a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder i'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her who suffers from this mental affliction to that effect i'm sure that none of what has been shown is blown out of proportion on the contrary it is a true representation of facts br br the performances are good on the whole as can be expected konkona sen sharma shabana azmi and of course rahul are very good indeed they emerge as very real characters credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times people may think me terribly queer but i think there are moments when one can identify with as well i suppose all of us have a streak of insanity inside us perhaps some more than others these are the people who are singled out after all don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams impossible ones at times would we be dubbed as being off our rockers if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds would a person with low self esteem be considered a schizophrenic because he she shuns company preferring instead to live in a world of his her own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security br br konkona as is outstanding her performance is so effortless she lives her part she has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting a case in point is the part where she's distressed at the scene shown on tv of saddam hussein's arrest her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense as if she's really heart broken at this tragedy her brand of indian english too is so spontaneous and natural br br however the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors and waheeda rehman splendid actors both seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in english their diction is less than perfect stilted and affected the fact that they are making a supreme effort becomes more than apparent their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale br br the brutal rape of konkona seems somewhat unnecessary any other incident would have sufficed just as well i feel the point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness as the psychiatrist explains one cannot with any modicum of conviction or certainty say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia to the fore then why are we subjected to the scene where lies bleeding and unconscious was ms sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power if so then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film br br the ending seems somewhat abrupt is the audience expected to find a solution where does disappear to does ms sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible holds true in other words is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity i'm not very sure br br a thought provoking film on the whole and well worth watching however if you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy everything cut and dried with a water tight solution to each issue that comes up this film is clearly not meant for you
<START> idiocracy felt like mike judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film in fact the movie is a social commentary almost feels like a documentary at times luke wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe like in most of his movies br br of course idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society but that's what makes most comedies funny a extreme of any situation fiction isn't that much different then reality br br with kids praising hip hop culture and taking pride in being ignorant when people feel useless in life they breed giving them a purpose in the world and it seems only the worse people breed the most i can understand how others don't like it it doesn't help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor not much different than a kevin smith film br br idiocracy throws away logic reason any intelligence for good reason br br mike judges comeback was a knockout
<START> don't look in the basement this little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the video nasties list the flute rattle box soundtrack is classic the main character although way hotter than most low budget starlets is a pretty standard low budget lead the doctor masters character is well written and well acted some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie it's campy i ain't trying to lie the character that makes this great is a man child named sam one of the patients in this sanitarium gone mad flick the gore is pretty standard although i think the color of the blood is awesome it's so red this movie i believe was received poorly because of it advertising scheme some soulless little ad executive got his grubby hands on it and thought let's rip of the ad campaign for last house on the left that's doing well little chumps like this have ruined the world of film all balls and no brain also the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic maybe there all drunk you'll see what i mean one more little note don't buy this from the wally mart dollar rack they have cut it to and unwatchable level try to find the longest cut you can
<START> i've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years not consecutively of course i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11 and it was so atrocious i almost walked out i think i didn't realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended anyway it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up i can finally give it the rating it deserves br br 1 10 that was strangely satisfying
<START> we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age with the likes of the four feathers 1939 and zulu simply because the imperial age was for the most part british here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age br br america's projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility is smitten by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of native peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history br br though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant roosevelt's big stick there is a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed this is high adventure at its best
<START> i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid but i can't remember whether i watched it or not seeing it now considering how utterly forgettable it is i still don't know Â so i counted it as a first viewing there have been several films featuring the title character a creation of visionary french author jules verne these include 20 000 leagues under the sea 1954 with james mason in the role master of the world 1961 vincent price mysterious island 1961 herbert lom captain nemo and the underwater city 1969 robert ryan and the mysterious island of captain nemo 1973 omar sharif br br this version stars academy award winner ferrer however even if the premise itself isn't half bad Â awakened from suspended animation in his submarine the nautilus and finding himself in modern times nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the u s navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith Â it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet for instance five seconds into the film meredith's assistant Â donning a steel mask Â rants that the world shall be ours equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly decked out midget whose task it is to fire the professor's all important delta beam and how about those android type minions aboard meredith's vessel who never seem to do much of anything br br ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout but meredith is an embarrassment in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film where the budget was so tight Â mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects no doubt and both evidently influenced by star wars 1977 Â that apparently they couldn't even afford him a decent costume he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub the supporting cast includes mel ferrer playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production voyage to the bottom of the sea 1961 and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engine room of the nautilus lynda day george unsurprisingly she's the only female character around and horst buchholz as the king of atlantis Â for whatever reason nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continent br br by the way having been reduced from a three part mini series for theatrical exhibition the film obviously feels choppy Â though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began
<START> i have to say when it comes to book to movie adaptations the bbc rarely lets me down now regarding this mini series i love the starling novel it's by far the best murder mystery i've ever read the mini series it defiantly made my day when i saw it the primary story was kept near perfectly intact the characters match the ones to the novel very well the personalities and mannerisms were spot on for red and jez i thought duncan was done very well as was kate eric came off as too much of a simplistic character he had a little more depth in the book but they also altered his sub story so that may have had to deal with it of course there are changes but most are cosmetic but some i found disappointment in the sub story with eric murder charge was changed and that changed the whole dynamic between red and eric for the movie and they cut out the training jez was doing some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly over all if you liked the book you will like this if you like the mini series then you'll love the book i must say this is the most accurate book to movie adaptation i've seen
<START> i watch a lot of movies dvd features and classics you name it the night i watched jericho mile my wife who had ordered it on the internet said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years somewhat reluctantly i sat down with our daughter son and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles we all were br br she who remembered the original and our kids 18 and 16 who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it our favorite scene bar none when peter strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says i'd do it again it didn't advocate violence because it was a defense crime but evoked such intensity we couldn't believe it when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts there wasn't a dry eye in our house br br someone please make more movies like this one unbelievable
<START> isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on cartoon network is aimed at girls while i'm not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on saving private ryan or band of brothers it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on tv i could watch to satisfy my violent urges and something that i would not get made fun of for watching i did see some episodes i should really be shot for this and had to sit through the movie now where do i find a gun and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes if you like seeing 500 foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall this is a must see but it does get very boring after a while and with a show like this even original ideas become chiefly dull the movie just felt like one overlong episode i can't remember any of it and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey this show is a laughing stock it churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while the ending will always be the same the powerpuff girls save the day all is good and nice but all is very very repetitive i give it 3 out of 10 for being the only cartoon on cn to revolve around violence although it is aimed at girls so i won't be tuning in for it ever i've established myself as a fan of war and violence films and i won't have that reputation destroyed 3 10
<START> in my opinion dads army is thee best british sitcom of all time i believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode this include the movie you must at least watch a series of this show get inside the characters become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in when you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing but it still works watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this you'll not be disappointed good episode to watch is no spring for frazer
<START> corey haim is never going to be known as one of the great actors of his time but at least in movies like licensed to drive he was more in his element lowbrow humor br br dean book watchers was one of his earlier works and still probably his finest to date sadly this magnificent tale of a brilliant dog a deranged mutant and a genetic experiment gone wrong is butchered horribly the acting is so lifeless you might think you're watching a zombie movie only the dog gives a respectable performance and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog you'd be better of watching the incredible journey cujo or even c h o m p s okay maybe not c h o m p s br br if you've read the book avoid this movie at all costs if you haven't read the book read it and avoid this movie you'll thank me later br br a somewhat better translation of a dean koontz book is the capable thriller phantoms
<START> may contain spoilers ok it wasn't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than i had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie br br i usually don't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly i mean duh he's a rock star but anyway i loved stuart townsend in this and aaliyah although she had a small part in the movie was amazing br br and even though tom cruise played lestat in the interview with a vampire i have to admit that i am glad he turned down the role even though i normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff br br overall the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it even if there were parts that could have been better great vampire movie
<START> in this episode locke and eko go searching for the symbol that we saw during the lock down on a previous episode michael having shot ana lucia and libby struggles with his actions as libby inches closer to death br br the most interesting thing about this episode i think is during the commercial break locke and eko find a hatch under the plane that killed boone in season one and a new training video ends with copyright the foundation 1989 in a following commercial break a rather bizarre and nondescript commercial advertises the foundation a planted commercial and the website advertised www com leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of lost's storyline a must see for all fans
<START> misfit recruit private owens tests drill instructor sgt moore's jack webb skills no explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex it is set at the parris island s c boot camp and most of the cast were actual marines memorable one liners abound and the closing credit's dedicated to is intense with such strong male and female characters this movie could not be made in today's touchy feely world
<START> i still find it hard to believe that a fine if overlong novel by dean koontz was transformed into this utter excrement br br this movie is so bad it's disgusting boos to all who participated shame on you br br p s the fact that sequels have appeared just goes to show how little taste and discretion remains in silver screen land
