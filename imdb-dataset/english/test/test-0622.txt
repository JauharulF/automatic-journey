<START> this early warner brothers talkie son of the gods 1930 deals with the racial intolerance that anglo saxon americans show towards the chinese chinese americans are treated like second class citizens and whites hold them in nothing but contempt br br prolific scenarist bradley king based her screenplay on rex beach's novel about a young impressionable sam lee richard of only angels have wings who experiences racial prejudice first hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about sam once they learn about his heritage sam goes to his father lee ying e alyn warren of gone with the wind who is a wealthy with offices not only in new york city but also in san francisco sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave new york and go where he cannot be hurt by americans his patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance sam has yet to learn this lesson he refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to london england peeling potatoes while he is on board br br during the trip he encounters a british playwright claude king of arrowsmith who needs some help writing a play about the chinese sam and he strike up a friendship and sam furnishes him with cultural information about asians while they are relaxing in france sam meets a beautiful young woman wagner constance bennett of two faced woman who falls madly in love with him it seems that and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel everybody at the motel knows about sam being a with the exception of sensitive about his racial heritage sam holds at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him they fall madly in love together father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that sam is a and all the memories of living in san francisco and dealing with floods mind she storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on lookers br br of course sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events he thought that loved him but she didn't about this time sam's father lee ying falls tragically ill and secretary of sorts eileen mildred van dorn of iron man sends sam a telegram about illness predictably sam rushes home to new york to be at his father's side since his public humiliation sam has vowed to show no kindness to anglo saxon americans eileen is an irish catholic and probably one of his few white friends lee ying dies and sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti white racism until he learns that he was an anglo saxon foundling that a san francisco cop on the beat gave to lee ying and his wife to bring up the cop forgot about it until two white busy bodied social worker types wanted to take sam away from the sam learns this revelation about the same time that comes to new york and falls ill during her illness she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see sam and requests that sam visit her in order to help her recover unbeknownst to sam does visit her and she improves but she has no memory of his visit merely a hazy notion eventually learns the truth about sam not being a and they marry and live happily ever after br br this socially conscientious warner brothers first national pictures release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that sam has no chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise the reconciliation between and sam stretches credibility despite their self professed undying love for each other however in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it they wind up in each other's arms br br the capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that sam isn't chinese damages some of the film's moral power incredibly son of the gods is a pre code film that almost seems prudish for example sam is an american not chinese constance bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips sam with her riding crop claude king is good as and e alyn warren is convincing as lee ying interestingly warren made a career out of portraying asian characters richard is flawless as sam he delivers a highly nuanced performance despite its age son of the gods is a son of a good movie
<START> as a massive fan of the three tv series i was very interested to learn that log were moving onto the big screen in my more honest moments though i had my doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit comedy and horror that infuse the original series br br unfortunately my fears were not unfounded and the film was a huge disappointment i struggle to understand the other comments on this site obviously people are entitled to their opinions but the guys i watched it with all agree with me and they are just as big fans as i am br br the acting lacked conviction but they are so good that even when not at their best they are still highly watchable the main problem was the plot and the script there were a few laughs but not enough a few moments of disgust but not enough worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after walking out of the cinema so rarely have i felt so utterly uninspired by a film and so unmotivated to discuss it with others br br i write this comment as a warning to other league fans get a wide range of opinion on this film before going to see it if you love league you might be able to convince yourself that they didn't totally mess up their move to cinema if you can't convince yourself of this then you will have tarnished in your mind the otherwise spotless genius that exemplifies the tv series br br log at the cinema more like log or little brown fish

<START> when northfork debuted at the cannes film festival many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow while i agree that it was slow one of the slowest movies of the year in no way was it boring as roger ebert said there has never been a movie like northfork ' i usually don't agree with ebert but for once he speaks the truth although john sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish brothers' northfork br br northfork is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art house film instead of the latest jack black movie the plot isn't some hackneyed cookie cutter plot it's just so strikingly original a small town in montana named northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down therefore the entire town must be evacuated some people however just don't want to leave in a side plot a young orphan duel is very sick and bedridden he's being taken care of by father harlan nick nolte the boy imagines himself as a fallen angel so to speak who help him out through his time of sickness br br although much of the movie is straightforward some of it could give david lynch a run for his money there's odd weather patterns a weird wooden huge dog thing and symbolism that would make fellini proud it's not as overall confusing as a lynch film but it's still quite odd that's what makes northfork so great it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible br br northfork has a magical feel to it it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it as i said earlier i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other however i disagree when he says that it is not he goes on to say it's just enthralling ' perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is but in lieu of how slow it was i still thought it was very entertaining something many dramas now can't do br br northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie but if you can get to and through it you'll be extremely surprised as i was br br my rating 8 10 br br rated pg 13 for brief sexuality
<START> admittedly before seeing house of wax i assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as the darkness or amityville horror after catching an advanced showing at my college campus i can honestly say that the people at dark castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher br br starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip coming across an odd detour taking them through country back roads meeting creepy locals after the slow but mandatory back story this movie really reaches a fast clip paris hilton appears in this film as many already know but i really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance clearly her acting wasn't worth an oscar but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her let's just say less noble media appearance into this film ms hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie and not simply because it was her death scene br br this movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares but serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters the causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters which we do by making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments these standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film and provide many good scares in fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded house of wax museum is br br this film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres though i'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title references to such movies as both texas chainsaw saw and even titanic see paris hilton's big death scene and you'll know what i mean are common but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs not bad
<START> while walking to buy cigarettes the professional dancer daniel tom long is abducted and forced to have kinky sex along many days by three hooded women when he is released the director of his company isabel greta scacchi has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives a cold reception to him the disturbed and humiliated daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to seek out the abductors daniel has sex with many women that he suspects that might be the kidnappers br br the book of revelation is a weird movie with a promising beginning that loses the initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap opera or soft porn chic the production is classy the cover of the dvd is awesome but the characters are not well developed and the trauma of daniel seems to be excessive since most of the men would fantasize with the dream situation that he was submitted Â to become sexual object of three sexy women the melodramatic development with the illness of isabel does not add any value to the plot the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title it is very clear that the screenplay about a man's feelings was written by a woman it was good to see the still beautiful greta scacchi again and her make up in the end is impressive there is a saying in portuguese that could be translated to english as follows if the rape is inevitable relax and come daniel should have done this and spared me of watching almost two hours of a pointless story my vote is four br br title brazil o das the book of revelations
<START> hated it with all my being worst movie ever mentally scarred help me it was that bad trust me
<START> i've enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didn't date when i grew up i did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like the crowd is angry hey where did they get those tomatoes from ' then i thought 'who cares this movie is not 100 serious anyway ' br br the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didn't like all the actors this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast a more gothic style and no involvement of prince br br nowadays many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics i don't think this is entirely true there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's and a bit with batman robin a director is free to choose what kind of batman he's going to portray as long if it's good br br my opinion batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious it's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea br br i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well especially the dark knight there's simply something about this movie that interests me more nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman that's a bit too much for me i'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere br br my conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the nolan with the burton movies they're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better my respect is for both directors
<START> i hope the people who made this movies read these comments the choreography was horrid the plot was and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk br br the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move camera cut aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects the lightning was just plain stupid the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen br br next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts br br honestly there are shows on t v that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one br br stick to martial arts unless its as poor as your acting then take up
<START> what should i say i only saw this flick for curiosity and this is truly a shame i grew up in brittany with stories of celtic legends and spent 5 years in rennes the town in which this film is said to take place shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in rennes they could at least have chosen a likely town or a likely forest but nothing even seem like brittany nor rennes and calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience besides those details it could have been a good film but it's crap silly scenario silly characters and no originality definitely to avoid
<START> this show is the best it is full of laughs and kevin james is the best so if you want a good show i recommend the king of queens and its a letdown that they canceled it so in the end this show will make you forget your worries and troubles cause if you have a cast with kevin james and jerry stiller you cant go wrong so i don't know why the canceled the show if any one knows please tell me now a days you cant find a lot of shows that fulfill your needs as an audience after seinfeld and king of queens the only show worth watching is prison break and if that stops i don't know what to do in the end if i had to recommend a show it will be king of queens
<START> the polish brothers are unique film artists and they've really pushed the envelope here a fantasy that has points in common with wings of desire northfork tells the story of a '50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the u s government's desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands it's a wry parable about loss and remembrance featuring angels dreams premonitions and the most hilarious government reclamation since repo man the performances are all outstanding especially nolte and woods i've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics and i want to say that's one of the things that makes this film so great its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life david cinematography is stunning highly recommended if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss such as the death of a parent i would even call this film necessary viewing ray
<START> i really don't think producer george lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as more american graffiti turned out to be but in retrospect it was the first crack in his then seemingly impenetrable armor coming straight off the huge success of american graffiti and produced basically at the same time as star wars this film was the first that lucas successfully took away from coppola without having to bother directing it himself the result is typical lucas far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material the writer director bill norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen and split screens to produce odd associations in the images while it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself br br lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical last big night before school ends and kurt ron dreyfuss and steve ron howard are supposed to go off to college one thing that made that film work despite the fact that it's very episodic is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end there's a disposition of time like in nick ray's rebel without a cause where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life but everything takes place in a static space more american graffiti is basically the opposite the space is very dynamic with toad charles martin smith off in vietnam his former girlfriend debbie candy clark partying with hippies in san francisco steve and laurie cindy williams involved in student protests in berkeley and john paul le mat drag racing on the semi pro circuit in a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch john race but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time just seeing various events on new years eve in what seems to be 1967 68 and 69 it's easy for the audience to become confused and i think it's fair to say that we do while the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film br br the best parts of the movie to me are the ones with candy clark in sf and charles martin smith in nam some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other a good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better and if the other parts weren't such a drag speaking of drag racing the whole plot with milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame unfunny and throwing in mackenzie phillips for a cameo didn't help at all it was just another contrived moment like when they briefly explain why curt isn't in the movie because he's already in canada instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor there's a black kind of satire to some of the vietnam stuff very similar to what i would imagine lucas and john original idea for apocalypse now would have been like and there's some of that manic fun in the san francisco scenes that made the first movie fun but still along with that fun stuff you have the rest of the movie dragging it down as if anyone wants to see steve and laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment i think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything it just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something a cheap freeze frame imitation of two lane blacktop and so many better films br br like the original however this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable the performances by country joe and the fish are great and scott glenn all up as a hippie in love with candy clark is a sight to see i wonder if even back then he had to use a wig i couldn't possibly recommend this movie and yet it has some small affection in my heart because i love the original so much every couple of decades i guess i have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as i remember it being it's a party killer but it's something that every fan of american graffiti or george lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice it shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked it makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that lucas actually made such a good movie as american graffiti in the first place as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for bill norton
<START> i know a lot of people have said don't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles that is a really lazy way to think of a movie if you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art this being a masterful piece of work if you want to watch this its not about the fighting really there are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part this is not the basic kung fu movie the story is really the central focus and not the fights and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching and is even better in the original language with subtitles
<START> this flick which is a k a life in the fast lane is easily one of the least entertaining movies i've seen in a long time i think it was made in mind of the sick twisted and jaded l a women who represent about of the population in the states the characters are all one dimensional even the lead after she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors a cheap laugh is attempted and by sticking a cork in the boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding oh clever patrick dempsey whose movies are almost always a class act sarcasm plays this devil who changes her life but from what we've seen her life was this series of vignettes to begin with no emotion no laughs no story the only reason i give this a 2 is that jeffrey jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style albiet zero substance in the camerawork otherwise one of the 5 worst films i've seen grade 2 out of 10 an f i think that even the most drugged out junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film i can't stress enough how much you should stay away br br
