<START> this is standard fare from a director who as long been amongst my favourites br br even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of his other work but its argento and this may be biased but i'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway br br it does contain a lot of good ideas the subtle voyeuristic element the needles under the eyes the gory and disturbing deaths and the argento clichÃ© flashback br br downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack acting and the ending br br all the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the end br br a fairly good film from argento but he as done better a lot better
<START> we've all got to start somewhere it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like budd boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june 25 1945 br br the war on europe was over for almost two months of course not even harry cohn could control the events of history so i'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater the cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the oss in that part of the world br br when you're an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina foch he's about to go on a mission to the orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in china against the japanese occupation germans who've been bugging otto house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who've already lost the war trying to help their allies who by the way they refer to as 'japs' when foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about wright's danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge she goes there and foils the plot br br all the stuff you'd expect from a nice noir film is there the foggy atmosphere of san francisco the dimly lit sets budd boetticher tried his best as did the cast but they just weren't convincing probably because they didn't believe this claptrap themselves br br it's possible but not likely that nina foch's dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor i think it was just a lousy screenplay br br and budd and harry cohn at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here
<START> so it's a space movie but it's low budget you ask what about the effects the effects are at times good and at times really really bad i mean bad and notice i started with the effects br br there's a story here but it's told in what i think is the wrong order i don't mean a tarantino style wrong order i mean it's told in a completely nonsensical arrangement most of it's about a mother in the future because you know it's sci fi as told by her daughter which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughter's perspective only once you're through the first hour and hear paul voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he'd read it this narrative is so constant and inclusive that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hour br br there's also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers if you're not doing 2001 and want to have some action this one does then please hire a good fight choreographer otherwise your fights will look like well what's in and notice the title has the word battle in it ugh br br i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept and some effects my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as costing 1 8 million when you compare it to something like primer which did better with a budget of a few thousand you realize in low budget film making it's all about the story i wasn't expecting much but i was still disappointed two out of ten stars
<START> am i the only one to notice that the realism of the 19th century ship is erroneous actually it's a 15th century right around if memory serves me because the realistic ship in the movie is the now as far as i know the never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia i don't know who handled r d for this film but using the and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed br br they even printed it on the cover art and the dvd i wonder how may other people noticed this little blunder not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful i would have expected better from sam neill
<START> this movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done the main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie br br 1 boobie miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a game at texas tech this means he won't get anything done during the season at all and chris comer comes up sooner on the team br br 2 the game against marshall was lost at marshall the team depicted as marshall was actually high one of main rivals and here is the proof marshall high is the mavericks colored scarlet and silver high is the colored purple and gold look at the jerseys and you will see who it is also the real marshall high's football roster is overwhelmingly black the team shown was racially mixed like high br br 3 only loses to lee by one point in district play lee loses to high and high loses to these are the teams that set up the coin toss as such br br 4 boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to chris comer and after not getting any playing time in the lee game he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again br br 5 brian chavez was a tight end and defensive end who wore 85 not a tight end and strong safety in addition boobie wore 35 and ivory christian wore 62 br br 6 the coaches end up liking chris comer as a player more than boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too this is in part why boobie quits the team br br 7 dallas carter is played in austin at darrell k royal memorial stadium where ut plays in the state semi finals not the state finals carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an player br br the acting is done pretty well but if you read the book you will see these flaws are pretty true i am also tired of hearing all the pc hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of dallas carter's football team the team according to the book is as large monstrous talented and black as the movie shows people say it is a racist depiction but reading the book you see a true depiction of the team the story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3 5 10
<START> i have to say that this movie was really quite awful the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography i found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the clichÃ© lines did nothing for me the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and did'nt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary the ending wasn't satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didn't make me feel anything for the characters this movie was boring and did nothing for me i recommend this movie to no one
<START> don't mind what this socially retarded person above says this show is hilarious it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are br br the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a days br br give it a chance everyone we are only one episode in we finally have some canadian programming that isn't absolute crap as canadians what do we normally get bon cop bad cop or corner gas come on people show that we are all not as prudish as the previous reviewer br br way to go comedy network giving a new show a chance the panel is funny and the contestants so far are pretty good
<START> i saw forgiving the at a paramount screening and loved it i have to be honest i really didn't want to go and i had become quite jaded about the movies being made today i have to tell you forgiving the was fresh and wonderfully put together i laughed my ass off it was great story telling i could not believe two guys shot this and put the whole thing together i thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them and then i thought be the jaded guy iam the studios would probably f it up anyway that being said thanks guys i got lost and in your film and that's why i go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours
<START> this movie was so bad it was funny for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie a la for your consideration the cliffhanger scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt the script was dreadful enough but coupled with sean young's terrible acting especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail complete with flashbacks while dangling off a cliff makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie i still can't believe how this thing got made first of all how did such a bad script get the green light how did star actors get attached were they at low points in their careers questions questions
<START> classic author c s lewis once wrote an essay stating that no children's story is worth the reading viewing etcetera if it can only be enjoyed by children i'd say this film is an easy one to hold up as a defence of his argument br br around the age of five or six i loved it tracked it down only three or four years later and found it to be wet poorly animated dully and confusingly written and with distressingly repetitive and awful songs i'm looking t you hi showing a production aiming at joyful silliness and whimsy but resulting with an ugly twee frustrating mess br br by all means show this to your infant but i would heartily recommend that you don't buy a copy or attempt to sit in on the viewing if you want something set in the same era but with genuine charm and wit go after 'oliver twist' or the bbc's brilliant adaptation of 'the box of
<START> anastasia the mystery of anna was a two part star studded historical t v movie based on the peter book anastasia the riddle of anna anderson it keeps up historically pretty much names are changed etc but sticks to the real story quite well omar sharif and claire bloom do quite well as the russian royals czar nicholas and alexandra what stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by rex harrison and olivia de havilland all in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting i was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on nbc in late 1986 also starring was the fine german actor jan niklas who had previously starred in nbc's other russian epic peter the great br br i felt that part 2 skipped over some important details of anna anderson's trip to america it's important to know too that in 1986 less was known about the anna anderson story back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the grand duchess anastasia was genuine by the late 1990's more was known and anna anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud br br too bad the networks aren't making fine made for television movies like this anymore
<START> i'm sorry but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before but they sure didn't act like they even seen a zombie before jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs second the characters are pretty badly written the actors did the best they could with what was given i blame bad writing and bad directing lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest they loose the sample twice and the girl jennifer holland doesn't know if she's been bit or not how stupid is that as much as it hurts to be bitten one would think you would know plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue dumb the first movie had it's flaws but it has re unlike this disaster of a movie which i could barely get through once i give the house of the dead 2 no guts all stupidity the crap o lantern
<START> brilliant thriller deserving far more fame mitchum and ryan are awesome in their starring roles as is the entire supporting cast a truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding based on a novel concerning homophobia this movie attacks post war anti and all intolerance and hatred with considerable power though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences it still has the power to shock and works very well as a thriller in its own right a credit to all involved
<START> 8 2008 when i originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film i took a critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically phoned in their performances which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously br br but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main mega stars lived a great deal longer after its release br br with the exception of spiner all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise unavoidably a lot longer in tooth than we've seen in many of their other film and t v work but isn't almost everyone br br seeing it again while it certainly won't be regarded as a in any of their careers it is a fun film with a lot of interesting scenery as well br br from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting a film to be another citizen kane or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast
<START> although this has to be the nadir of season six this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted it's just that most of us looked to the x files for taut gripping horror thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but conspiracies season 6 gave us a stream of tongue in cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and frankly made simpsons' halloween specials look like great thriller tv br br in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town br br there's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none too sophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks it's nothing you'd want to see more than once br br it's hard to figure out season 6 x files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers
