<START> the problem with this series is that it is too real i am watching it on amazon and having just finished episode 2 i hate absolutely hate the leader of the cell i cannot recall any television series ever having this emotional impact remember the old tag line for horror movies just keep telling yourself its only a movie well i find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its only tv but of course it isn't only tv is it the possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the united states is certainly within the range of plausibility that's what gives this program its vicious authenticity and that's why i hate it so much
<START> i swear i had never seen such a bad movie as half caste is not only because it just makes no sense is a huge piece of and self confidence that makes me puke br br sebastian in spanish has a similar pronunciation to which means out of life and happiness makes here a one man army movie thinking he is sam raimi or the boys who directed the blair witch project this is the blair project with an expensive low budget br br the story a couple of american filmmakers that go to africa to make a documentary of the half caste is just no sense the way of filming inserting high speed shots with slow motion shots just your stomach more than the stupid lines what the hell is that dialog about bestiality or the lame performances by the way i don't believe this cast or caste is american they all look european to me br br to finish this just say that the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie they put a fake award achievement as most original film and a nice cover in spain the cover had the half caste image in negative so i feel now unhappy because i can't demand my 14 euros back
<START> yes bad acting isn't only one thing to mention bad script not so bad music unfortunately br br nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too br br first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun smiling br br they find everything in the sea i mean things like fishing net knife scuba dive things ropes bottles husband br br stuff are you kidding stupid they are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy love peace love just stupid br br terrible skip this one please
<START> closet land the title itself conjures up thoughts of secrets and that is really what's at the heart of this amnesty international film government secrets personal secrets both are integral pieces of this story br br by far the greatest acting seen in too long a time both alan rickman and madeleine stowe were phenomenal in their portrayal of a government interrogator and victim respectively with only the two actors in this unusual standard length film it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and shut the door br br a word of caution br br what isn't mentioned on the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse while there is no graphic detail about the abuse the nature of it may be difficult for some viewers to watch especially given the intensity of the film on whole br br i'm not a big fan of amnesty international films but this movie drew me in because the acting was so exceptional and i can't help but make this movie one of my personal favorites
<START> i lived in that area hoboken and jersey city for about ten years this film certainly captures the feel of that time and place the dialogue is very good the music is right and scenarios realistic as another poster said it looks almost like a documentary br br i like the way it humanizes these kids who probably would have rather have been born in westchester but fall into what kids fall into it just so happens that area is pretty rough br br they over the cops quite a bit but that's to be expected i'd say the acting is good all around too br br it gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out of proportion hopefully the new mayor of newark is making progress
<START> warning some possible plot spoilers as if that was possible br br okay if you haven't figured out the plot yet i am going to give it to you two couples head out to a camping site but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem br br now it is time for me to give these couples some advice br br 1 never ever go to camp dubbed camp blood by the locals 2 don't have sex or make out in front of the killer 3 don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away 4 don't yell profanity at the killer 5 make sure your cellular phone works before you go camping 6 everybody needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times 7 wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes no tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals 8 wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you don't stab the wrong person 9 always carry your car keys on you 10 put out a camp fire when you go to bed 11 watch your step if you trip on something your going to break a bone 12 check the backseat for uninvited guess 13 if the killer has you cornered at least put up a struggle br br and guess what at least one but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules they are the dumbest characters ever to grace a film br br now for some brief comments this slasher film was on a very tight budget so low four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role the acting writing direction sound lighting camera work plotting editing etc are all bottom of the line but like the classic film jack o this works on a sooooooooo bad it is very entertaining and campy fun level so rent this and have a good time and laugh my rating 5 out of 10
<START> ok please believe me when i say that this is a terrible terrible sci fi movie its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as unintentional surrealism and its absolutely a 100 waste of time awful but somehow also deeply unfunny i watched this as a double feature with recon 2020 the massacre and although was an incredibly superior film that's not saying much the plot of is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow the narration is cryptic often nonsensical seemingly endless and thoroughly exhausting literally half the film is scenes of the female lead who looks like brian bosworth walking through the desert the movie actually starts out pretty cool but then into and somehow continues to deteriorate minute by minute absolutely horrible and truly an absurdist endurance test zero stars reviews by flak magnet
<START> first let me say that those of you that voted it 10 are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level something that this movie doesn't deserve the only movies deserving a 10 imo are the classics godfather shawshank etc look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list i also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave though i would have to agree with them on the surroundings they simply aren't rating the movie as a whole they are infatuated by the surroundings but miss the overall review that would be like me voting a 10 for the movie from justin to kelly because i think that the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the florida keys though that may be true it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was rancid br br i wish i could tell you that something saved this movie as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick something else picks up or makes up for the weakness ex bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot and or great camera work and scenery we started the dvd and it all started out fairly normal we jokingly started to pick out who would be the first to die after a brief bit of driving and hiking they set up camp for the night at that moment i keyed in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film two main problems i had bad effects and an even worse story line the first thing that we all noticed was that the campfires weren't real you can plainly see the cgi or fake flames that they were all sitting at for a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what i was in for the next hour br br only minutes later i was shown how poorly written this film was i don't remember exactly how they arrived at the point but basically we find out that the token nerd is writing a book about exploring caves etc another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience but hesitates stating i don't want this story in your book the author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him a direct quote if i tell you the story you will definitely want it in your book at this point i was fully expecting a nice 5 minute story complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting what i got was a short poorly told and acted statement i say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences i don't remember the exact quotes but basically he says we were in a cave the cave flooded a girl died as our friend watched her drown you may think i am over exaggerating and being really critical but that isn't far off from a direct quote line for line from the movie scene br br over the next 50 minutes or so the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what i would imagine to be like in a cave i could have really done without the really fuzzy hazy look to the film and the camera shaking is just one that i didn't go for i have really good vision and after watching the main parts of the film i felt like i was legally blind i was emotionally detached from this movie therefore the parts that probably should have been scary weren't maybe had i been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film i would have at least been scared but i don't remember anyone in the dark room even twitching at any of the action scenes br br the last scene was probably one i will never forget and that isn't a good thing basically two women are trapped in a room naked the monster comes in to attack kill the women he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy a flashback occurs where we find out that the monster was injured as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave cut back to present time and he takes his mask a large skeleton with what appears to be a shirt he glances at the picture and the two women appear to have found the weakness soft spot at that point he stabs and kills one girl then proceeds to rape the other woman rather graphically after about 30 seconds of watching the camera jiggle and shake as he rapes her roll the credits movie's over br br honestly if i had to do it all over and i wasted money on renting this movie i could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that i have now br br those of you comparing this to blair witch are way off if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of blair would realize how revolutionary it was handing each cast member a script the day night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius br br if imdb would let me it would get a negative score i don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie
<START> i'd love to see some tie in between the fury and the x men series sort of the way the second outer series would tie in particular stories and plot lines after the fact to create a story arc although one was never intended i'd also like know if some more information anecdotal or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship and or collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg i simply can't get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film does any additional information on the subject actually exist finally it's been 17 years since the film was released and i had hoped there would've been a sequel by now does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel
<START> every boy eventually learns the lesson that just because a girl is good looking it doesn't mean she's good well lemme tell you at age 19 lesson learned it's hard to tell what's worse kathy ireland's acting skills or her ultra high pitched voice the one that sounds like a screeching mouse on helium scratching its tiny little claws down a blackboard with an incomprehensible plot set in outer space with dwarves that want kathy ireland's bones for some obscure reason this movie is just wrong on so many levels if there were ever a candidate for a mystery science theater 3000 revival this would be it
<START> being a fan of bela lugosi boris karloff and lon chaney jr i had to see this what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of lugosi karloff and chaney jr along with all the vintage clips that do not gel with the new black and white footage not even close to steve martins dead men don't wear plaid that was done great with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change be warned this is really bad but if you like lugosi karloff and chaney jr then watch their movies instead even ed wood did better then this one new actor mark redfield is pretty good as an imitation bela lugosi the clips they use are the ape mr wong most dangerous game lost world indestructible man and devil bat that notorious bela lugosi classic i believe this production was very low budget and it shows 1 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed watching this movie only a few parts were slow but it was only setting the mood and building up to the action i thought this movie was very educational it taught me more about my croatian heritage i also learned more about louise and i can say she has a very great influence on me time magazine named louise one of the world's 100 most influential people in april of 2004 i recommend this movie to people that like historical movies obviously this movie was very dramatic but still told the truth of events in the former yugoslavia louise is a brave hero and i'm glad they made a movie honouring her if you see the movie i hope you'll like it
<START> the only reason i bought this dvd is because cynthia rothrock is in it now everybody knows she is the queen of martial arts b movies the trouble is this is not a martial arts movie cynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of fight scenes in this stupid movie now if you were a film maker and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie would'nt you want to have a lot of martial arts action all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crap i own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them if you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what i'm still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this dvd
<START> the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema well at least it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they aren't yet they soon will be it is a story of screw ups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murder br br this is in my judgment definitely the best danish movie of the last few years br br 9 out of 10
<START> like the beauty of the jungle jessica alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for when in theory we should be watching for the narrative br br the plot is thin on the ground and hard to believe as beautiful as jessica alba is she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'dark angel' series since dark angel it seems that alba has been reduced to mere eye candy but what eye candy and is the sole reason for putting her into films br br the concept of the sleeping dictionary is daft and implausible with little character development or character for that matter to make us want to undertake the 109 minutes run time with this world despite the films short running time it still manages to feel to long and too laboured br br it seems a shame that such talent such as brenda blethyn emily mortimer bob hoskins are wasted on a threadbare narrative which barely raises a pulse this film seriously misses a trick an exotic setting a more than capable cast with lovely cinematography and a chance to utilise the themes and the concepts of but there is little narrative to speak of no drama no sense we are watching a story of love more a story of lust and woman happy to please men without question lets be honest if jessica alba was freely allowing you to sleep with her do you seriously think you'd be able to concentrate on learning a tribal language therein lies the great problem both in suspension of disbelief and also what the female characters are limited and reduced to take for example the fact that jessica alba's character undergoes the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and birth to her forbidden love yet all we see is her looking lovely and curvy one minute then lovely and curvy with a baby the next br br it's a sorry state of affairs to see a film with promise not live up to anything near it's potential i could write endlessly of the films flaws but it pains me to do so the film looks good the premise could have been made into a lovely film but sadly it wasn't to be
