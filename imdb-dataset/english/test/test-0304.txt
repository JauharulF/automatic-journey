<START> another one that slipped by the radar of most anyone this little b produced gem is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive that a dreadful feeling about the lack of cojones in today's cinema slowly overtakes your body the final set piece is so innovative in its setting and style that it prefigures everyone from tarantino to john woo oh and if you think dying lines are all cliche wait for the dying line of ff a piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart a true pleasure seek it and see it you won't be sorry
<START> this ok comedy about an aging father c aubrey smith who decides to gather his grown children from around the world davies is working as a chorus girl in new york when she gets the news that daddy wants her hmmmm sounds familiar davies' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so so comedy as she upsets the staid british countryside with her brazen american personality not as sharp as some other davies comedies but still worth a look ray milland plays her long lost brother doris lloyd elizabeth murray and halliwell are all fun too
<START> after a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good movie this movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attempt br br the acting by the grandfather the boy and the doctor are simply superb they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life every bit of action has some meaning in it i would recommend to watch this movie as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectations br br this film is really going to touch your hearts i would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this
<START> as being selected during the des this year 2002 catherine is masterfully of her autobiographical film there where her lead actress anne la femme nikita luc embodies admirably the film director of intimate scenes br br this is a comedy of actors' manners making of film genre pornography or exhibitionism sex is comedy is a post modern film with its script based on a film within the film as an implosive story of a minimalist love scene the film is built with a constant solidarity of the forms and the spirit in which keeps on breaking and analyzing the taboos using visual codes and certain sense of the formula catherine implement her clinical analysis of the sexuality as an isolated problem outside the society to be communicate by the door of the heart br br therefore grÃ©goire colin good work nÃ©nette et boni claire denis the of angels eric in the role of the actor and roxanne mesquida fat girl catherine marie from the bay of angels manuel prada the actress are actors whom she invents she does clarify in an interview observes the man in front of him even a chaste man then films the shame and the sexual mutilation but also a big hope a disturbing dimension of the ecstasy a nudity of the feelings the of the exhibitionism playing to be one to be one the director is finally expected to lead the actors to give their feelings their body and their soul so arranged facing the problem of the order of who i am the actors of put on an vitality to merge in her work in progress but for what is a shape of incredible exorcism for an actor puts many enduring at the same moment a big suffering the actors appear to be the ones who look for this loving transport to be part of the eternity of their work br br the art of is of researcher to know how to undertake in a dialogue aiming at pushing away the limits of intimate scenes join make up prosthesis in erection and syndicates are not without reminding what pictures and scenes of jan and rembrandt could be in the anecdotal and the daily of characters on a shooting set while the moral categories disappear from the background of sex is comedy succeeds in revealing the loving imitation power of the actors in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity
<START> technically speaking this movie sucks lol however it's also hilarious whether or not it's intentionally funny i don't know horrible in every aspect it also is the only movie i know of that has 1 a fat kid being played by a slim actor in a very obvious fat suit 2 an attractive 30 something actress playing a character who's supposed to be in her late 60's and 3 the most compliments for plastic yard daisies ever don't take this film seriously just watch it for laughs a great party movie
<START> i watched this movie with my boyfriend an avid hip hop fan and he was really really looking forward to catch the soul vibe the movie claimed to have boy we were dead wrong when i finished watching the movie i felt two things remorse and relief remorse because i regretted wasting my time to watch this awful piece of dung and relief because i watched it free on cable br br this movie really really gives a bad name to black people by putting so much awful stereotypes that i believe all smart black people everywhere has been trying to spell off i'm asian and i feel very very sorry and sick for those who made this movie what more to say bad writing even worse acting and horrible storyline br br even if you're bored to death and has no other choice don't watch this movie seriously the movie really has nothing to offer except if you want to see things like minor illegal drinking animal slain women degradation and overall a really really bad obnoxious sickening awful movie yuck
<START> spoiler it could be the one the worst movie you see you might like it like i did i really like it its one of those odds movie br br there is man who seen to have a had day in life blacks rats some how feel sorry him which i think was a good idea br br the killer rats become friends with man two big man come making feel unwanted so the man set the killer rat on them and floor to floor both bodies covered in big black rats not that much blood br br but think about big black rats all over body but start to little killing people but rats are going over bored until the rats kills his friends and girlfriends br br ther one scene in were seating on the toilet while rats are going into the pipes leading to toilet and rat goes up his you know and come out of his mouth which mean the rats must off eaten everything inside in body's i had me laughing for weeks br br why did i like this movie yes it's different of the rest i for one like it when little creature takes on mankind br br if you have seen any of these movie slugs slither them spiders snakes tremors cujo crocodile shark octopus br br if you liked them and check out hood rats br br it better then terror toons that all i can say 4 10
<START> the only reason i know this film exists is because i wanted to see what nancy had been up to since the facts of life ended when i searched her name up came this relatively new tv movie after much investigation i managed to locate a copy was thoroughly disappointed with what i viewed d grade acting poor script terrible fx it was like watching a toned down more stupefied version of day after tomorrow that went for 3 hours despite the long running time the characters remain fairly under developed we do not care about them in the slightest in most cases are longing for their demise combine that with terrible lighting cinematography you have a real disaster of a film how they con so many name actors i e dianne randy quaid brian dennehy to appear in such trash is mind blowing in summary i want those 3 hours of my life back
<START> this movie made me watch paul w s anderson's and enjoy it i am not even going to dream of comparing requiem to any of the alien or predator series' movies this is a horrible teenage b horror footage set in an american small town no one cares about br br at least had heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie sets it had bags of eye candy not previously seen in any of the original movies but was ruined by unconvincing characters acting br br requiem takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable level and it also lacks in every other department just as much it's a sacrilege to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish
<START> not good mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people some comments 1 i am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds says something 2 fine so rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer but charles is completely different in all aspects from her father if anything henry is much closer as a sensual exalted person 3 how could you ever believe that she would be more attracted to tom wilkinson than to rhys meyer 4 hard to believe if she had been in fact raised as a deeply religious girl that she would be so careless about sleeping with a gentile after knowing him for 5 minutes br br some good things about the film at least she didn't end up pregnant not knowing who the father was the whole description of life in the jewish community in london is good
<START> yes this review may contain spoilers but you'll thank me for it this is the worst film i've seen in quite some time i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and spacey's performance in particular br br some will chastise me for saying it but i find kevin spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him i felt like i was watching a meaner version of kevin's american beauty role his character in this film is ridiculously overacted all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant br br there are all world trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low somehow i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button this is approximately 20 minutes into the film br br what about the faux homage to dogs whaley proclaims i think i saw this in a movie once as if he's going to cut off spacey's ear but what does he use to cut him an envelope that's right he's going to give him paper cuts that has to be one of hollywood's all time worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling br br i will admit that i didn't see the end of this film my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense well i don't care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over the top dialogue i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did
<START> i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information score 6 7 well not so bad genre scifi good i like scifi so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it but but no br br as in summary this isn't a movie at all it is a religious advertisement including about jesus god devil end of the world etc movie starts with a epic abduction story driving at night car stops bright light and so on well actually that was the film last of this ummm frankly i don't know what to call it was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement quite a same stuff what these tv tell you but they are good at it br br honestly if you wan't to see a scifi movie or something with ufos please stay far away from this thing it has nothing to do with them if you want to hear some cuckoo head's opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do then go ahead and watch this thing but i still prefer going to the church at sunday br br this is complete bull and evangelical christian propaganda as another users said well i should have red another users comments before i got the movie br br 27 of voters have rated this thing as 10 yeah right please go somewhere else to do your propaganda
