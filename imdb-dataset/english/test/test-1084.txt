<START> for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s its shocking how not a lot of people know about it br br this movie is definitely worth a look it has all the things you need for a horror movie especially the good old chills br br i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago but i couldn't remember the name of it so i came to imdb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title i eventually got the name of the title and bought the movie i still love it as much as i did all those years ago br br buy this movie
<START> this movie stunk there is not much more to it the final fight looked like walker taking on my grandmother not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men i found the commercials more interesting the plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away the only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended avoid this at all costs unless you enjoy bad chuck norris movies
<START> kudos to dp for making this look like a real movie the first time that's happened in this series with the notable exception of the f x scenes in moving closer to movie production values however it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two they were very much in the 'so bad they're good' category of horrendous film entertainment can an argument be made though that the were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it there are so many times in the film where they discard their own belief system as to be annoying if everything that happens is according to god's will and they are simply his instruments than the people who are infected with the virus have that happen as a part of his plan right apply that to every situation where someone of faith doesn't submit to god's will and you get a fairly hypocritical little movie from the director of 'action jackson'
<START> i like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem i caught this totally at random on the movie channel last night and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way there's really just a unique voice to the film a poetry of narration that's meaningful without straying into pretension there's also many hilarious moments from middle school days that are crude without being potty humor it's sad that this movie is so low rated the fact that there are so many 1's makes me think the numbers are cooked i can't see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal sure this is by no means a typical romantic comedy but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him give this flick a chance it came out of nowhere for me and i feel the richer for it
<START> i once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about 6 months back i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold and because it was somewhere in the film's middle and i didn't want to spoil the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start i decided that i would rent it immediately well the video store which i frequent did not have a copy so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it i had previous to that experience only seen some chaplin shorts funny but not greatly artful but after i saw the snippet of the great dictator i checked out three of his other films city lights the gold rush and modern times city lights was great i found the gold rush a little overrated but still worthwhile and i found modern times to be one of the funniest films i've ever seen second funniest behind keaton's sherlock jr more exactly br br finally the whole of the great dictator well to be honest it had its moments both of comedy and of drama but these moments don't always mix well chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama city lights is the best example of this but it didn't always work with social commentary plus the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of chaplin's talent don't get me wrong i liked the movie as a whole but i thought it of little consequence i would have given it a solid 7 10 on the ratings scale if not for the ending the final speech that the jewish barber gives is enormously powerful yes it is to the et mores of 1940 but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today the speech brought me to tears and i consider it one of the best endings i've ever seen final score 8 10
<START> zzzzzzzzzzzz this one came directly from the jaws cookie cutter mold with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films and wow i guess i got what i deserved br br very slow moving and talky much of this killer shark movie takes place on land which isn't really that surprising it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors and that's too bad most of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eaten br br the plot concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while roasting weenies the indian for some reason gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe supposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish or something like that br br it's a good thing too because wouldn't ya know it years later a monster shark appears and starts gobbling up people in the sleepy seaside community when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark the remaining three are determined to kill the thing especially since big shocker here the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over yawn br br the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious and you can see them coming a mile away my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while they're sitting in a van then jumps out and says i'm going for a swim immediately to be gobbled up by the waiting shark they had a lot of nerve calling this film deep blood since you hardly see any just cloudy water the actors handle their cliched roles like they're all thumbs and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy rocker type bad boy who threatens our goody goody heroes then turns good in the end to help kill the shark br br it took me a really long time to find this film it is rather obscure so i don't think there's any danger of too many people wasting their time on this however if you should be lured into it don't say you weren't warned
<START> a terminally dull mystery thriller which may sound pretty sound theoretically but plays out very poorly the ludicrous script is full of minor spoiler people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to and the director doesn't seem able to work up any energy and suspense the gooey sequence that kind of explains the film's title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film 1 2
<START> every great once in a while you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations given the imdb rating of 4 0 i wasn't really expecting much with the brotherhood of satan i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devil's rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed satanic horror films i couldn't' have been more wrong what i got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast i really enjoyed speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s the brotherhood of satan doesn't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks as a viewer you know something is amiss but for the longest period you're just not sure what it is the unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films the ending is effective with its surreal imagery i sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll those wanting a big slam bang finale will be disappointed with the ending's simplicity a lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would most likely have failed miserably br br there are moments in the film where it's easy to forget the director bernard had primarily worked in television before the brotherhood of satan there are a few scenes that are so well set up lit and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two for example i've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors not here the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is amazing we see all five men at once Â each doing their own thing as in real life in a lesser film we might see all the men at once but each would be motionless quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue it's a small scene but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of the brotherhood of satan br br finally i mentioned the acting in my opening so without going into a long winded speech i'll just say that the brotherhood of satan features martin and l q jones any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me
<START> picture this someone makes a film about the columbine or virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone i know this isn't but bare with me and stars sean astin off of goonies picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film unfortunately it doesn't go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didn't go crazy enough pity its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness well worth a cult status
<START> i would ward off any temptation to view this movie it is quite simply dull the characters are predictable and mindless the assassin is quite there is no tension fun no style or even a glimmer of originality to be found in this train wreck and the morass of hollywood clichÃ©'s are stifling oh and you have a movie that makes a hero of an ira terrorist cute and now i need to speak some more to fill up the ten lines and a little bit more is that enough not quite how about now no well further should do the trick but the is really not worth ten lines of exposition the original was great though
<START> great horror comedy from michael davis iwas laughing so hard i almost peed great acting from eric as the good guy who saves the day great performance by the jack black esquire like performance from justin urich he was just divine in this film this guy deserves to be a big star also aimee brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of jeepers creepers the gore to was given in copious amounts i loved it i just hope they release a not rated version great low budget horror comedy the dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny out of
<START> i've seen every episode and the characters have all remained the same self absorbed whinny little brats thought out there's no character development in 5 years getting pregnant is not development if your still the same daddies girl only now whines to danny because dad isn't around sam never changes or grows which makes her boring repetitive and just so annoying its sickening after season 3 danny is a typical soft character that gets ordered about by everyone in his life he has no principals morals of his own especially mary and the old boring clichÃ© will they wont they on and off relationship does get boring very fast indeed br br james cann can act and his character is ok to watch only he is just another hack writers wet dream an ex cia man that has huge contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or cheater known to man even though the cameras cant do half the stuff they make out its fun for a while however in 5 years the writers act very dumb why because they have all this expensive and advanced technology but no simple walkie talkie communicating is fast and easy you never see security walking the floor only when there's a situation and suddenly everyone is just there br br the plots very quickly move from the cheating and robbing the casino in one way or another to awful typical american boy girl relation ships the same done to death material seen all over the world they have sex but i hate you i've always loved you i think i do but i love her him instead but what if maybe one day blah blah blah br br i'd recommend to people who like las vegas it has so much more going for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced down our throat for 6 months of the year br br i'm glad to be british Â i'd rather see the same actors in 5 different shows rather than 5 years consistently getting worst in the same one
<START> the wind easily one of the worst films ever made the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too i mean if this represents the market for indy horror i could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes br br a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out but the are no story terrible acting awful cinematography and virtually no editing that last one bothered me the most as an editor myself this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all every scene was shot in a master they had absolutely no coverage at all for anyone who doesn't know coverage is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience yeah this movie had none of that i'm talking about even the simplest of scenes example an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing who's in the scene and where they are then as the conversation goes on you would cut back and forth to over the shoulder shots as the conversation continues you may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table or in someone's hand anything this is film 101 stuff guys it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work every shot was a camera lock down no movement no cutting no nothing if i was teaching a course in filmmaking this would be the visual aid for my what not to do lesson br br in closing don't waste your time folks the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all br br br br
<START> i watched the world premiere of this on the starz action channel they call it vampires the turning the plot was a little confusing there is a voice over in the introduction about an 800 year war and i didn't quite understand the movie is about a young couple somewhere in asia maybe in china i don't think the movie specifies the couple has an argument and meredith monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of vampires the boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans and enters into a battle with the bikers a human group of slayers somehow get involved and the final fight sequence takes place during a solar eclipse this movie is not related to either vampires or vampires los muertos confusing but decent action four out of 10 stars
<START> this movie is based on a stephen king novel in which mysterious new shopkeeper leland gaunt max von sydow offers each citizen of castle rock the item he or she most desires but there is a heavy price to be paid for these local sheriff alan pangborn ed harris is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances br br below average for stephen king cinema i can see why some people would think it was boring it plods along without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time yet again with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is spooky br br i do enjoy the novel and don't believe that this lackluster movie does it justice there are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen br br von sydow makes gaunt much too charming we're supposed to be scared of gaunt at the right times not amused by him i also hate it that the sheriff's primary deputy ray is written and portrayed as such an annoying barney fife type moron star ed harris looks as if he was forced into doing this picture by his agent but professional that he is he really sinks his teeth into his dialog bonnie bedelia as love interest polly and amanda plummer in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles come the closest to creating characters who are likable br br yet it is also foul and mean spirited br br although i'll be darned if it didn't feel a little cathartic watching a bunch of unlikable movie characters tear each other to pieces the climax has some good explosions br br i often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve but in this case i feel i should really be honest and just say 3 10
