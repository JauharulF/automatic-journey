<START> wow where to begin with this one well if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers then this one is for you i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at b movie god casper van blunders and boy was this one of them it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever this thing which is supposed to be an indian ghost looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on halloween he dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag complete with what appears to be a bucket shaped bonnet over his head at some points this is a man in costume at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse this monster has the uncanny ability to see with predator vision a clear rip off and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear sometimes the spear cuts people sometimes it doesn't this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow wow this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of critters this creature is impervious to bullets but somehow dies at the end of the movie at the end of his killing spree which we never really find out why he is on he gets blown up this is an incredible feat for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film but i guess this last time was the charm br br and don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters first of all what delta force unit employs women last i checked the military still disallows women into combat situations also this unit is undercover why what possible reason would they have to be undercover and they're not even good at it i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms but they were all carrying machine guns which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film at some points sounding like air rifle bb guns and at others canons there is one part when the skeleton man throws some construction workers from a catwalk and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto at another point michael rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground they tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline but he is clearly pushing himself along in this fall scene then when he is helped back up the hill the rope is flat and when it shows the woman at the top of the hill the rope goes upward from her grip not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill rooker actually has a line that says i'm not going after him i going after it what that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard and i watch these bad movies as a hobby the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing production of this film thought that it was so bad ass believe it or not compared to the rest of the dialog this is good br br the acting bad the makeup really bad these characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face yeah i think i'll make a movie about that attack of the alien scars that move around on your face that villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man and the film would probably be scarier
<START> i just recently discovered this fantastic series and i just can't seem to get enough of garner's laid back pi the shows continually display excellent level of writing and suspenseful episodes br br this episode of hand is a little different forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend br br the mystery is great and it's unraveling is convincing enough it's based on a book can't remember the name and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode garner excels here as rockford gets tough and really means business this has a noir feel to it all the way the dark lighting and overall mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40's and 50's br br really good episode in a class a series easily deserves a 10
<START> this is a really great series i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter o yes for gilmore girls it is very awesome they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch they do everything together just like my mom and me ya for gilmore girls um i'm running out of lines but i love how luke and relationship is finally shaping up they so needed to be together and i absolutely just love sookie st james she is so awesome and the show wouldn't be anywhere without michel the whole show is dry humor sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other especially the gilmore girls
<START> progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives the hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens br br if ya ask me this is a great scifi horror story taking a highly questionable real life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas so if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial you should be pretty happy with progeny at least story wise anyways br br unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average with average acting by all actors yep even by the consistently awesome mr dourif who still does deliver the best performance though the black head doctor delivers his lines really well there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy which is fine in my book i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese and i mean that in a good way br br anyways with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors i especially didn't care for the mother hysteria the film went for she wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband who's a doctor said to her it almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her br br the progeny is another flick by brian yuzna from the icky sticky film society again he delivers some slimy effects and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror if you're into scifi horror or are a fan of dourif and or yuzna films there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance a generous 7 outta 10
<START> this is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence just like curse of frankenstein from 1957 if you don't like odd non mainstream films steer clear of this masterpiece for me the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the the storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today for being produced in the 1980s this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with big government and big brother wanting to control and monitor us br br there are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes thats why i've watched it 6 times now but if you can digest it all it may prove to be well worth your time br br the film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism they are only concerned about accumulating and procreating the hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been tagged and monitored by big brother his mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow to once again be a part of humanity br br yes its very low budget but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating if you have an open mind this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling
<START> if you're a science fiction fan and you've only seen this movie once please please go and treat yourself to a second viewing i just did and i was amazed about how good i thought the movie was as opposed to when i first saw it three years ago the first time around i was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie but by and large i didn't think that much of the movie as a whole it was an alien rip off and i thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science that they were allergic to light was something i found especially ridiculous based on my first viewing i recently rated this movie a 5 br br however now that the sequel chronicles of riddick is on the way and the movie poster for that one looks amazing i thought i'd better brush up on pitch black once more so i borrowed the video from a friend i am so glad i did there's so much of what i thought i remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate i thought most of the characters died very early in the movie this was not so i thought claudia black's character was the first to die this was not so i thought riddick was the sole survivor this was not so br br i see now that the movie works extremely well there isn't an excessive tiresome focus on the monsters it's much more of a human drama the main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting and there are so many little details that make the pitch black universe coherent and believable such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet and so they turn on each other br br and i have to mention the astronomical vistas again i mean we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail with bits of zapping through the hull then we come to a planet with three suns just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is engulfed in a blue glow as the eclipse approaches we see the huge neighboring ringed gas giant rise across the sky and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings these scenes are created with a sense of beauty wonder and detail and i don't think i've seen any other sf movie that really made such a point out of including these things i hope we see much more of it in the sequel br br pitch black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10 a cult classic you bet
<START> if we compare the movie industry with an ocean we have the tendencies to observe only the surface driven by the strong hollywood marketing force we all saw war movies like saving private ryan the thin red line apocalypse now or full metal jacket but underneath the splashy waves grow in silence from time to time less known pearls when you pick one and look carefully at it you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown br br stalingrad is such a gem why it has a bunch of multi million dollars rated actors no it have thousand of extras no it have breathtaking spectacular shiny computerized visual effects not at all so what's so special well in one word it's pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later the tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here filthy wounded soldiers russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion burning villages collapsing buildings decayed suburbs explosions tanks in flames soldiers shot burned alive ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces you got all but the real horror is elsewhere people are reduced to simple pawns without the power to change anything the soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail the civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere only crying for their children killed the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans equipment villages cities and ask for more victims and destruction over and over br br in all this collective insanity a group of german soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality they do their duty and fight bravely but as everyone know a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith we see how all those people are abandoned how they plan to desert how they struggle to catch the very last plane to berlin full of wounded how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as and shot how they were forced to execute a small group of russian civilians including a young boy how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks destined only for some superior officers of course one by one they drop dead the end of the movie is one of the most bitter depressing and touching ending i ever saw all on the magnificent score of the munich orchestra the war destroyed everything in its path br br this movie is a must see for everyone a true movie lover should have it in his her collection the strong anti war message must be a warning for all of us unfortunately the mankind never learn nor the politicians self destruction is in our dna and the human pain seem to last forever can we be enough reasonable to stop the war
<START> yes i am ashamed to admit it but this show is positively devine it's so entertaining and i have the absolute greatest time watching it ever since cycle 1 it's been great and i haven't noticed a downfall in it's glory at all tyra banks as you know is the host and as fabulous as she is there's also the other judges and co hosts such as j alexander jay manuel nigel barker and twiggy the main point of the show is for every girl invited to become america's next top model has to work their way up to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions it sounds great already doesn't it and let me tell you it is great it's awesome watching all the different kinds of photo shoots the girls take and each one is different cool and daring anybody who hates this show doesn't have a clue and i will tell you that this show will be on for a long time so deal with it
<START> in terms of quality movies this isn't one of them it's actually the first chuck norris movie i've seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed the fight scenes are slow and don't have a lot of variety norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring the movie also is quite short but for some reason the movie doesn't even seem finished when it ends it's a pretty anti climatic ending all the same though i've watched a lot of bad movies and this isn't one of the worst that i've seen it's worth a watch i'm guessing especially for norris fans there's also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie
<START> these writers are trying to re create the characters they have on scrubs in a different occupation however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and effortless these guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting which is leaving the shows only lifeline to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive the humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an i q of 40 or below another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show scrubs is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together this is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already
<START> coen brothers wannabe from writer director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other better movies yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist ha ha who goes on a killing spree in the desert the film is unusual but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience it becomes alienating and off putting with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating an admittedly bravura finale many quirky bits of business and forster looking great in the nude make this a curiosity item nothing more veteran movie director irvin kershner produced and maybe should directed as well could paul chart be a pseudonym 1 2 from
<START> they call this film euro trash horror br br well it's not horror the film takes place in europe so yes it's euro trash ah yes it's trash all right br br you know you're in for a great movie when right at the beginning the dvd gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch expect crackles odd jarring cuts and for the movie not to fit the screen plus there's the sound at first i thought i was watching a dubbed film then watching the lips carefully i realized that no it's that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of synch br br the plot itself is fairly goofy an old disfigured woman named dr bannister kills a scientist for his youth formula i'm not giving much away because when you see the old woman it's pretty obvious she's under a layer of thick badly applied make up anyone with a lick of sense seeing the fake old age knows what's coming next br br yes the old crone is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman complete with face make up and a long wig of hair br br when i say the old woman is disfigured i mean she has cornflakes glued to her face the film makes no attempt to explain how the cornflakes got there for that matter there is no attempt to explain anything at all relating to any of the characters they're never developed beyond the level of finger puppets br br the two policemen pursuing our anti heroine just wander about apparently baffled by the simplest clues the murdered scientist was working on a youth serum the old woman has disappeared and we keep running into a young woman how do these pieces fit together what does it all mean one of the cops sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth the other smokes a pipe that's pretty much all we get character wise br br dr bannister the crone now a beauty goes around wearing odd costumes and then taking them off so we can see her flesh she has affairs with men she gets in a catfight with a young woman in a nightgown she goes to geneva so we can see the lake there she water skis a bit then takes off her wet suit to reveal a strange bead curtain bikini she takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume striptease br br the ending well without giving anything away it's just a bizarre tacked on conclusion that makes about as little sense as the rest of the picture it's the sort of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says quick we need an ending for our movie what happens next br br the writer mumbles something half awake and the director runs with it br br what's good about this movie some of the music is campy and fun that classic 60s organ music that's so corny it's enough to make you laugh out loud there are some odd seduction scenes bizarre dialogue goofy moments br br it's very close to being so bad it's good i did manage to watch it from start to finish without gouging out my eyes or sobbing i guess that's praise of sorts '
<START> seriously i couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie for some reason the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting and yelling like cro magnon bipeds i understand that this was about gymnastics but seriously what's with all the roaring and human bleating i also saw at least five actors with overactive syndrome and stage 10 syphilis br br although this movie has actual human acrobatics i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns this is truly a milestone in the history of film making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely or sound br br incredible
<START> manna from heaven is heavenly this is a movie for the family teens and grandparents can enjoy it together but it isn't syrupy sweet or silly the characters really are characters the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit the period beginning is like watching an old photo album or remembering back when it's extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes the story moves along quickly with twists turns and lots of fun br br a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces many of whom we haven't seen in much too long a time part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear though this can be distracting cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if she's had a make over on oprah i had never seen faye grant in a movie only knew her as grace's mother in the tv series saving grace she was great even minus the southern accent and i didn't even recognize shelly duvall the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure
<START> i have only seen the minimum wage episode yet i have no intention of watching the others how can that be morgan starts theatrically complaining about his awful situation living on minimum wage right at the beginning of the episode and the complaining never stops ever luckily for the viewer his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as morgan if not even more annoying br br and then to top it all they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2 50 and after that go to a restaurant to eat out all the while they naturally complain about being poor br br i don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this no one should be forced to watch this crap
