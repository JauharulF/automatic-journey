<START> four or five episodes of johnnie and his flying robot edited together amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed squarely at kids parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robot monster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff you'd find in the al capone st valentine's day school and gangster training academy i liked it but then again i grew up on the series if there is any problems other than the men in suits effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes stitched together with a climax coming every 20 minutes recommended for those who've run out of or godzilla
<START> okay i'm just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show i happen to think this show is awesome i mean when jasmin weber was still on and was still alive so addicting and i was surprised to learn that this was categorized as a soap because it just doesn't carry the same look and feel as soaps in america soaps here are absolutely horrific at least films on location features real music and more plausible story lines moreover the acting on for the most part is quite believable especially with josephine schmidt and felix plus soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules if it's ratings are that high it must be doing something right soaps in america are shown in the day time and historically have always had rock bottom ratings give a chance trust me it's good
<START> i saw this film at film festival in 1997 where one of the screenwriters josÃ© giovanni was being honored it ranks highly as a great noir crime drama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film up there with the best of melville the title in english all risk ' in french tous is word play on ' meaning
<START> i enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so i wasn't able to watch them all i was surprised when it didn't return and had no i idea why still don't know but i guess that's not important br br great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years later br br the characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars that sort of thing a little woody in a way
<START> if family guy offends you or you simply don't get the humor unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious dull and politically correct people in america so put your morals aside and have fun with this show is a hilarious mind opener on the reality of today's society whoever said this show is for a young immature audience is very mistaken with all the references to old movies and politics 10 80 years ago i couldn't imagine any young immature kid finding this funny family guy is definitely for a mature open minded audience who are not afraid to criticize american society hats off to seth and the whole crew who were able to make this show happen
<START> i have watched this movie twice in the past six months what i go through so you don't have to the first viewing left me half crazed and babbling the second viewing at on a rainy morn was a little better i only screamed in agony once br br seems the aztec mummy had the hots for a certain aztec princess who was supposed to keep her maiden obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it now that is severe but before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching aztec ceremony the singing will make your ears bleed br br anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense not to mention a treasure map on a bracelet guarded by that swathed slob by this time looks like he's been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb his groans moans sounds like he has a bad case of montezuma's revenge or he read the script for this movie that will make your breath stink br br an evil dr von appears wanting the aztec treasure possibly to finance acting lessons screenwriting classes for cast crew he is called the bat because in the curse of the aztec mummy he wore a bat like cape hat and something like a ski mask over his face guess it's better than the laughing fat man br br the bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world he stresses this by rolling his eyes laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery he has cobbled together an invincible robot looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 buick this will make your eyes bleed a company even takes credit for making this tin can br br well the mighty showdown between and the robot takes place in the mummy's new crypt having been made homeless earlier br br about half of this movie is culled from la aztec never released in the us in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from jerry warren see my review on attack of the mayan mummy and curse of the aztec mummy the robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters if that and the plot doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will br br my first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one but after seeing mayan mummy which is a movie deserving of being burned and watching robot again it garners a 3 you have to watch this with no expectations at all then it can be naively pleasant
<START> i do not know which one was first released earlier in 1970 cannon for is an western it was made in spain this means this is fairly inferior to sergio leone's so called western spaghetti and to the real american masterpieces of john ford sam peckinpah howard hugues john sturges and anthony mann in my order of merit this order is not to be interpreted as all john ford westerns are better than all by sam i think imdb's 100 sort them out all pretty well br br the worse about this firm is the casting george peppard is fit for a sergeant's role raff for a maffia capo and giovanna ralli to a in piazza in the in rome
<START> tyra the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something weird locations too much makeup too much skin is not necessary sex does not always sell when you are selling to women the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural people come in all shapes sizes they need to have that on the show my daughter has a 36 is tall slender a size 5 i am more average at a size 12 we would like to see both i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes thank you
<START> so after years and years i finally track this film down i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft just staring out with a pale white face this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood i remember chills running down my spine watching it now its obviously nowhere near as scary but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again if anyone wants a copy private message me br br the story itself is fairly standard stuff its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around there is no real moral as such except that 'ghosts are here to help us ' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts ' there wasn't even a greed capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine however a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine but into a new mine hole which is totally dangerous the captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder deep into the mines simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults and not just help the trapped adults direct oh well
<START> this film is really quite odd clearly certain events portrayed identify the main protagonist as the dublin criminal known as the general but almost everything else is just wrong we are not talking of a distortion of ancient history but a complete distortion of irrefutable documented facts the question indeed is why the garda are shown as latter day keystone cops his gang as non menacing and the man himself as well kevin spacey almost pure fiction anyway why bother to try to give a semblance of realism having said all that it is a poor exercise any way you want to look at it not worth a second of anyone's time
<START> this is the kind of film one initially selects to make up the numbers from video rental only to discover an under rated entertaining and enjoyable movie the opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house wherein the wife has committed murder or is it and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened ok the film is a bit campy but has good editing and dialogue professional acting often humorous and the very last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its' kind definitely worth watching deserving at least a 7 or an 8
<START> we don't know if darlene loves all three gentleman certainly they are wary of one another yet they live together viewers might surmise that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward darlene might make for an unbearable home life br br in the eerily beautiful rural brazilian landscape emphasized by the frequent use of polarization and the use of stock anything might happen and the alternatives for any one of them save perhaps may not be alluring enough to encourage them to change their circumstances they seem to bear the intolerable because it is familiar the unknown frightens them into complacency toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can utilize thus it crushes them rather than strengthening them the web in which they are caught is made of the sanguine filaments which bind us all perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with it's portrayal of the inevitable fading of our youth's bright colors in the unforgiving light of time the three children will enter the world fated to relive their parents lives to one or another degree well filmed and portrayed the story is tragic in it's essence walt disney it ain't
<START> when i saw this movie all i could think was what a disaster no i'm not talking about the volcano but about the movie itself i have seen a lot of movies but this is certainly one of the worst ever i don't care about the fact if a volcano erupting underneath downtown l a is possible or not perhaps it isn't but even than this could have been a good movie but it sure isn't and i'll explain you why br br i don't know how much lava flows out of an average volcano but what i do know is that the volcano in this movie makes the and mount together look like a little barbecue i don't think there has ever been so much lava flowing out of a volcano as what we see in this film i'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie but i really wonder why he all spent it on the special effects and not on the script and the actors i'm not saying that he should have hired a top cast but this really is the opposite of what i would call good acting their performances are so unbelievably poor that it makes the entire movie even worse br br and what's wrong about the script you probably ask yourself well can you tell me who comes up with the idea of people standing a few yards or even a few feet from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for the heath or people sinking in the earth when the flow of lava isn't even two foot high br br i'm sure i wouldn't be proud if i wrote such a script but apparently there are script writers in hollywood who don't mind about believability as long as it pays good money very good money br br when you see the movie you'll probably agree with me that this is one of hollywood's worst disaster movies not worth more than a 3 10
<START> i give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter robert w morgan who also plays the part of jarvis in the film in listening to recent show called the show robert morgan is a co host he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film i think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more robert is a good man and i hope it does well he has devoted 50 years of tireless work as a researcher which is also one of my interests and author check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for blood stalkers ii sometime in the near future
<START> nothing i dislike more than a kung fu movie that plays for laughs it is the main reason i can't stand jackie chan or his he was not always a clown i must add my young auntie is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind it is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior unless you are 5 year old i really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny but humor is indeed a very subjective thing personally i think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre i did think leading lady kara hui was very good here but i had such a hard time sitting through this one that i could not enjoy her fine performance if you don't mind all the silliness you might enjoy it i know i didn't
