<START> greyfriars bobby was not a bobby was a skye terrier a highlight of my childhood day trips to edinburgh was to go to the monument to bobby i grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog as every child in my generation did and i remember lining up with my mum outside the cinema with many many other dundee children and their mums to see the wonderful disney film how could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a for heaven's sake that's like making a movie about the life of robert burns for instance and portraying him as an englishman i say give bobby back his breed
<START> first i want to clear a common misconception it is not unrealistic that the school zoey goes to gives students at my school those in grade 7 and higher must have apple this is payed for in the entrance fee moving on this show is very annoying it has boring predictable plots and bad acting often in the show it brings girl power to a new high with girls beating guys in everything they try but that is not the worst the worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances and screaming whenever they are happy except for the one smart girl who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science however this show is very addictive i do not know why but it is although the most recent season has been so terrible bringing the stereotypes boring plots and bad acting to extremes i never thought were reachable so i am no longer addicted thankfully
<START> i believe the production value is ok probably deserves a 4 10 or 5 10 it's traditionally filmed featuring good looking people with model quality and a little class br br but the premise let me annoyed a decent woman would do such dirt i mean she is gonna marry a man who would have sex with another woman br br and what's more serious she is also active in the behavior only in de mind the film also have many aspects that makes eastern europeans seem immoral br br after all it's just movie if it doesn't intend to degrade women in general i will give one more point but obviously it does br br conclusion a nasty piece of crap with a little taste
<START> another of those flimsy stories coupled with most forgettable musical numbers powell and o'keefe as battling publicists are quite forgettable however there are two shining moments hubert castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you will ever see his drunken walk on the wire has to be the most spectacular piece of balancing ever recorded on film he has to be seen to be believed the other is sophie tucker doing a turn near the end of the film her magnetism her professionalism her sheer talent at being herself well charisma is not learned you have it or you don't a great lesson for all would be cabaret artists a sad note w c fields in his last film cameo is completely forgettable
<START> this documentary was neither professionally nor objectively made the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by ibm to win the match in question just to make some money garry kasparov has an ego problem he was puffed up before the match and when he lost he didn't like it i remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win as time went on i started to lose and didn't like it today i simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good not only that the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games where both sides are more likely to err and open the game to exciting possibilities this documentary keeps showing us images of the which is an ancient chess playing automaton that was really controlled by a human being from the start until the end we are lead to believe that ibm short of literally hid a human gm in the back of their cupboard sized computer i'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because garry lost ibm must have cheated i know how computers play chess it's not magic and it's no mystery they can be trained have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans it's really no surprise that deep blue won perhaps at the time it was if it happened today given the ever increasing processing power of machines people would hardly blink if a machine couldn't at least draw with a gm today people would think the program was weak
<START> in logan lerman plays roy eberhardt the new kid in school who has just moved from montana but florida is a lot different from montana despite is troubles in blending in roy discovers a bigger problem a new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of burrowing owls are in trouble can the new kid a tomboy brie larson and a runaway cody stop big business from destroying these home br br this movie was pretty good the kids logan lerman brie larson and cody are the real stars of this film luke wilson officer is okay but really does not have a very big part neither does robert wagner mayor or jimmy buffett mr ryan br br nevertheless this was a fun film that the whole family will enjoy for a first time producer i thought jimmy buffett put together a quality piece of work plus the owls were really cute
<START> the recent release of mad dog morgan on troma dvd is disappointing this appears to be a censored print for television viewing some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version mad dog morgan deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut however even as released on dvd the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century australia after having toured the old melbourne gaol with death masks of convicts on display it is mad dog morgan that comes to mind
<START> i was sorely disappointed in this movie twice i was to walk out because segments of the movie were so and depressing the movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life pornography murder suicide fornication hatred gang warfare the graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing br br and richard does a great disservice to the lds church in portraying missionary attitudes commitment spirituality and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical br br my biggest objection to this movie however was that it is the exact opposite of a feel good movie br br god's army one was okay his brigham city was quite good this movie in terms of casting acting and drama was his best but in terms of being inspiring or uplifting it was as awful as it could be in fact this movie so me that i am sorry i went i have lost interest in ever again supporting in an lds themed movie with a ticket purchase
<START> it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005 this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise didn't they do that with truman capote the same year and the zodiac killer last year interesting br br writer director david michael didn't have steven spielberg's budget and c thomas howell is not tom cruise this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed million worldwide br br the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett who played a pastor that was giving up on his god br br gary busey was creepy as an army lt
<START> this movie from what i remember was such a great movie i watched it on television when i was 11 and couldn't remember the title of it if i remember correctly i do believe that it was a christmas television movie special one of my friends at work and i were discussing it several years back but neither one of us could remember the title but we did remember almost the entire movie no one else at work remembered ever seeing it thank goodness someone at a tv movie website answered my post now i have the fun job of locating a copy of it it's amazing what you can remember as a child but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head even after 28 years and i do believe i only watched it once maybe it was because i am the oldest sister in my family or maybe because i babysat and worked in day care centers that it stuck with me that long regardless of the real reason it has remained one of the movies that i have been really wanting to watch lately if anyone knows where to watch it online or has a copy please let me know i would so love to see it again thanks so much seriously i tried to post this and it says my comment isn't long enough so apparently i have to type more did you know that melissa is the sister of peter billingsley who starred in a christmas story i know i'm not the only fan of this movie so if anyone has any idea on where to find this i would greatly appreciate it
<START> absolute grabber of a movie and given its age years ahead of its time i first saw this the week my dad came home with a neighbor's tv that the guy had thrown on the scrap heap a with all things electrical dad had it working inside two days this was july 1955 and then probably only the third house in the street to have television pretty much the first thing we ever saw on that grainy and flickering old 12 inch screen was this film it's pretty old dear i recall my mom telling me br br almost 50 years on and it doesn't seem any older rather like world war i in that respect terrific little fantasy about a london omnibus carrying thirteen passengers that crashes killing one of their number then in flashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them to being on this bus that very day br br returning to the crash at the end of the film the victim's identity is revealed perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie the list of adrian messenger br br if ever you come across this little gem i suggest you watch it
<START> i can imagine what happened for this film to come into being a bunch of studio guys are sitting around drinking gin and tonic maybe a joint and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap which at that time was about as far apart as archie bunker and mick jagger something that both college age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting for different reasons perhaps but still a ticket is a ticket what interested hippies asia philosophy pacifism and wild sets and costumes what interested their parents musicals eye candy a feel good script and nostalgia very well then lost horizon the old classic as a musical in color can't miss right it was a bomb lost horizon by james hilton is perhaps less than a classic but not a bad novel in broad terms he sketches out a utopian society in shangri la the valley of the blue moon near tibet inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of i very i long lived monks intruding into paradise is a gilligan's island like of outsiders a veteran of wwi a missionary etc each with their own spin on the situation what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise or try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century taken on its own terms it's gentle pop lit fluff presenting hilton's own conservative british views in oriental dress as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie as captive honored guests of the monks the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley but never pressed into work or prayer not that the monks do too much of that themselves treated royally and given simple yet luxurious who'd want to escape in this middle american heaven on earth the monks are both cultured and wise the climate is warm the food is plentiful and tasty the villagers are picturesque and nothing ever changes the nuns are chaste but encouraged to look pretty and even flirt a bit the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of tantric sex i've ever read even their religion is nonthreatening revealed as a best of both worlds blend of christianity and buddhism there's little to offend any but the fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about tibet which in the early thirties was a very small number br br as a capra film focussing on the adventure character interplay angles it was enchanting and perhaps steven could have made it fly if he'd been around as an early seventies hollywood product the adventure was over too quickly and the updated roster of characters too bland to make much of an impression deprived of the sketchy suggestive qualities of classic b w the monastery resembles a de beauty spa in white and pale blue and while at least some of the monks' robes tried for historical accuracy most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and bath with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon maybe stephan sondheim could have restored some grit to the story playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction just five years afterwards brian would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a t instead bert and hal david were given the job of writing the songs which marry muzak like melodies with some of the new agey lyrics ever penned quite naturally for the time every song calls for a dance number which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring and so is the script which has not one line worth quoting br br tie ins with this movie were legion there were everything from to posters planned to promote this film and such was the hype that i actually went out and bought the album just about the only thing good i can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after the next month i read bought a copy of the and hence learned about real tibetan culture moan br br
<START> i first watched this show hoping for a few laughs good acting and good plot sadly i got none of those things br br first off this show is completely unrealistic how can someone go to a boarding school that's super hip awesome location and barely any rules plus a sushi bar a sushi bar no school has a sushi bar and what's up with the huge ultra cool ultra hip dorm rooms this doesn't happen in boarding schools everyone in this show seems to be perfect zoey looks perfect has the perfect friends never has to do homework and is super popular sounds more like a villain to me i hate how they use so many cliques in this show example dana the skater chick she is completely ignorant and wears edgy clothes the jokes are old sooooo old too i wouldn't watch this show if i were you it's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon rating 1 10
<START> this movie embodies the soul of modern elite even though the movie is 17 years old the standing principle in the movie is food is more than just nourishing matter it is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself the main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture as they let go of their puritanism and passion denying table manners karen makes use of the difference between north europe and south europe to point out their inherently different approaches to food as the strict and and rather dull get infused with eros from south the party gets going so what are you waiting for go watch it again
<START> it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie br br imagine king kong being recast as an organ monkey and fay wray's part being played by a young boy how about elton john as rambo this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter br br by using the title watchers and dean name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book br br read the book i have never talked to anyone who didn't like it another good book is the winner by david
