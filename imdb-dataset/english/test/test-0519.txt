<START> the only reason i checked this film out was to see the early kim bassinger that and the fact that my tv guide said it was a gripping suspense and it was three star rated the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not robert culp turns in what has to be the disaster of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable at one point everybody is a suspect including a frail old woman if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written badly directed badly acted movie then go for it it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back
<START> what the hell is this movie about well if i didn't know that son of the mask is categorized as comedy i would never have a clue a comedy a tragedy that's the right genre for this yet another so called sequel br br yes i've watched dumb and dumber but i never believed somebody will ever make it's title real in hollywood yes you watch son of the mask and you think 5 minutes dumb 10 minutes dumber 15 minutes dumbest and then after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say i'm out of here br br sorry my nominee for comedy crap of the year 2005
<START> spoilers br br this movie was rented as a joke and what a joke it was the film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for el the dog catchers outfit is so ridiculous it looks like he the patch on his hat and for some reason he shows of his muscles by rolling up his sleeves throughout the movie mostly at night you can see how bad the lighting was they are in a car which is brightly lit and they are driving in pitch black often you can see the camera man's shadow on the ground the costumes are terrible the lighting is terrible and the acting is terrible this is a good movie for a laugh maybe
<START> we rented the movie and it maybe the worst movie ever the box they had in the video store had a cool looking monster on the cover but in reality the monster was a creature from the black lagoon mask awful awful awful you actually might have to rent it it's so bad it feels like you are watching a bizzare o home movie
<START> well to start with i'm straight up as black as black gets and i can tell you it's very sad when black people think a black movie sucks i can't say i've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story line br br snoop is my dawg and all but he wasn't feeling this movie at all i don't know how much they paid him to be in this bucket of crap called a movie but i hope it's enough to wash the smell out br br i'm all about supporting a bothers movie but this one was bad really really bad it blew chucks in every aspect no real plot story sucked cast couldn't act and the best one there was the white guy br br i almost demanded a refund on my way out the door of the theatre half the crowd up and left before it was over i'm still wishing i had too save yourself some pain and go see something else anything else
<START> uhhh so did they even have writers for this maybe i'm picky but i like a little dialog with my movies and as far as slasher films go just a sliver of character development will suffice br br unfortunately the prey provides if you think i'm being hyperbolic you'll just have to see it for yourself scene after scene we just get actors standing around looking forlorn and awkward abandoned by any sense of a script outside of calling out each other's names when they get separated in the woods natch the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation orion clearly plagiarized from funk scintillating slasher fare no and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesn't even have anything to do with the plot wait what is the plot at other times the prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we can't exactly hear what they're saying so we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring deliberately seriously i've seen more dialog in a silent film it's as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in in the heyday of the '80s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said hey i gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag let's somehow pad an entire feature around it and well they did br br to be fair the prey probably had some sort of writer on board i mean somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies however i am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever there are glaring pauses boring tableaux and zero sense of pacing throughout the filmmakers don't have anything else in the script to film so they fill out the running time with exhaustive of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced these critters are all filmed in straightforward daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography if it feels like a science film that's because it is i'm pretty sure this is all nature show stock that's missing is a stuffy narration from some national geographic br br more exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and another scene wherein a supporting character away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute and a half a minute and a half that's a lot of to commit to celluloid to begin with let alone insert into the final cut of the film way to go guys brevity and are the real victims of this br br admittedly the film picks up quite a bit of steam comparatively in the last 25 minutes into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip off of music for strings percussion and cuts in vaudeville great jackie coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby park ranger this was his last role if you can believe it and there are some nice gory moments including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation the make up used for the killer carel struycken aka lurch from the addams family movies is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young jason voorhees and freddy krueger plus if you love wacky straight outta left field endings you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up you'll do a spit take i promise br br usually i love films that are on this level of ineptitude but the first three quarters of the prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest overall this is a largely pallid and tedious affair and while it ain't all bad it should really only be seen by slasher completists why do we do this to ourselves anyway
<START> this movie was by far the worst movie i've ever had to endure i couldn't believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad i couldn't even laugh at it's pathetic attempt to entertain me if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at rent dr giggles instead
<START> as an american fan of the league of gentlemen i had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on dvd but it was well worth the excruciating wait apocalypse is fantastic funny freaky clever as hell full of in jokes and cryptic references to the television series basically everything you'd expect from the gentlemen br br the plot has already been discussed in other reviews so i won't bother re capping it although i will say when i first read it i was a bit hesitant obviously this device fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers has been used before notably in wes craven's underrated new nightmare and stephen king's dark tower books where king himself was a character the gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall though and even add a new element a second fictional world them days soon all three realities have weaved together and the result is exhilarating geoff tipps being knighted in the middle ages and trying to court queen victoria wood the real league of gentlemen in royston vasey being confronted by characters like pauline and dr chinnery david warner summoning an outside of bernice's church i've heard that some people disliked the king's evil sub plot but i found it hilarious especially character who seemed to be channeling judith the witch from series three br br speaking of the characters i was relieved to find that although hilary briss geoff and herr were planted firmly in at the film's core other more familiar characters were given their due bernice's confessional in the beginning was hilarious hearkening back to the quicker more sketch oriented feel of the first series pauline and mickey have cameos no ross though strange although i would've loved seen more of ms campbell jones papa is accounted for as are tubbs and edward all three are used very sparingly giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel and just what the hell did papa hack up like an obscene hairball according to the dvd commentary a wad of greasy pubic hair br br the film looks incredible but then what's new the music as always is breathtaking i was thrilled to hear joby new interpretations of the theme music and his slight re working of the majestic lovely piece that closes out both apocalypse and the last episode of series three br br i have some minor complaints it would have been nice to see more of the old familiar royston vasey and i felt the stop motion creatures beautiful by the way were a bit underused both of these issues however can be justified by the film's budget so they're understandable still as much as i loved bernice's new church it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street the gentlemen's original vision according to the commentary br br overall apocalypse is astounding especially if you're a fan of the series i can't recommend it highly enough 10 10
<START> some spoilers br br there's nothing in this movie that you haven't already seen browsing the net nothing is shocking about this film in the film a man sodomizes a goat there's a bulldozer decapitation and a lesbian's face gets burnt off all of these scenes of extreme violence are so fake it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to resurface this piece of trash i simply cannot believe i spent hard earned money on what certainly has to be the worst film ever made don't let reviews fool you this film would be a shame for anyone to own except maybe prisons who want to torture inmates for a real exploitation classic look to bloodsucking freaks or even the more recent doom generation island of death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and needs to be flushed out of existence
<START> an amazing piece of film that was well conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release the acting was generally well done the director should've asked alec guinness for acting lessons and the shot selections were impressive as in the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio this movie didn't let up since the opening scene
<START> i too found oppenheimer to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american pbs david suchet was particularly effective as edward teller as i recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good the only reason that the series doesn't rate a full 10 10 is for the low budget production values in some areas actual content is absolutely first rate in my recollection br br the oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the uk on july 31st it will be a region 2 pal set but it would seem that a region 1 ntsc set should be soon in the offing br br if you have a universal player in the us you can order the series right now from amazon uk br br http tinyurl com br br huzzah
<START> the laughs are few and far between in this dull movie and i can't help but wonder about how this mess ever got made in the first place about the only good thing in this movie is the talent of griffin dunne but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by madonna's obnoxious performance i was able to sit through this without getting too bored but that's probably the nicest thing i can say about this time waster
<START> if you've got a box of tissues a comfy couch a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a friday night this is definitely your movie its romantic its hot and its challenging for most of us gay people religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was but in latter days you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around which totally contradict being gay the two main cast members were totally hot but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me cry i have never cried in a movie which i thought was quite impressive for a b grade movie i highly recommend this flick you will laugh you will cry unless your me and you will definitely drool i love it so much i even purchased the dvd for my collection its truly the most beautiful movie ever
<START> bad personal opinion the folks who made it they knew that when they made it to star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three criteria 1 you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way 2 you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards note that i didn't say you had to do it well saves on time and paper work 3 you had to be willing to get naked gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales want to watch a better movie easy get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself trust me you won't do any worse as vampire movies go well this one sucks and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies consider the link between vampires and crosses now take a look at the symbols and names on the in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in ed wood couldn't have planned that kind of an accident any better himself
<START> got this the other day from the creators on dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel had never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on beach i just had to buy it i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in br br 1st off im not a big sci fi fan baring star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised this didn't turn out to be a standard sci fi more like a mix of sci fi and survival horror br br had a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with acting was better than average for a low budget film the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice br br weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in mode br br all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd release br br excellent work keep it up
