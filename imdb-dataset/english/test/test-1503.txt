<START> the detective story is not typical for the matrix universe it is a film noir esque private eye story with a strong narrator and a very rich feel rich in terms of its visual appeal the snowing scenes the it all stuns the eye br br but what about the story it is interesting even if it feels a little out of place the agents hire a detective to track down trinity he finds out that they tried the approach before but with hazardous consequences for the hired detectives still he tries to locate her and eventually succeeds through alice in wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms then things begin to get interesting br br all in all this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie br br 8 10
<START> i would like to say something different about this movie i saw comments how beautiful is russia and the views from russia have been great hey guys this is not russia it's bulgaria more specific the capital sofia so this is not russia it's my country about the movie well in bulgaria maybe except the grey zone all movies from american directors are in one word awful like this one of course it's a shame that patrick swayze has to play in such a low budget movies most of the actors are but really this movie has no plot twist has no energy what can i say weak and boring movie a clichÃ© not more hey people remember it's not russia in reality it's bulgaria
<START> all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film claiming it contains racist and or religious intolerance br br those who don't care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here br br those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public as evidenced in comments here br br what is an interesting premise which isn't original but is a combination of ghost and from beyond is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display br br it isn't nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans however it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a corman produced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of arkoff or sam katzman if you get it for 2 or less as did i you won't feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made
<START> the main achievement of this film is that though racially the film still manages to carve out a tableaux of war portrayals that leave a lasting identification with whoever may view it and whoever was present at this time though good films may have the ability of their subjects which is often a hard thing to do great films have the ability of their subjects which is what this film does br br instead of carving a context of unity the film depicts the japanese in the sick finality of the phillipines war front in february 1945 making signs for pacifism or war but rather making signs of the feelings death destruction victory and sickness of war with the bloody hands of the defeated far different and superior to films such as apocalypse now and full metal jacket both which needed a satirical methodology of trivializing and the american and using all races as one struggle which is fine yet not as grand as a film that uses one race and view which would look fascist if created in america to convey the horror of war and show what it is really like br br the only way the main character makes it through this movie to the end is by being sick thence inedible hence through this character through his sickness his saving face we see the end of wwii in the phillipines in february of 1945 and the way in which the americans japanese and came together in bloody acts of warfare where you live to die br br the film is patently influenced by a neorealist way of filmic portrayal which is original and beneficial to a viewer whether then or now for the neorealist techniques it employs conveys all the horrors of war in pictorial form whether a showcase for pacifism or like anno zero by roberto rossellini a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it br br the film's opening with the two way discussion between the two japanese soldiers prefigures and the events through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human and human with human it shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in the past battles but now in this opening or of the experiences of the japanese in the phillipines new information is relayed to the main character tamura giving a of a cannibal reliance on one another if they wish to survive br br the jungle is gritty wet and thick and the sky is not infrequently cloudy and pouring we wade with the though puddles and marshes as sick as the land around them nameless cadavers are strewn everywhere every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies rocks or corn apparently there is no difference here all is dead and sick all is dying all they have lest to feed upon are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades and or nameless enemies br br often tamura meets a fallen other near death though crushed in spirit and crushing his some offer up their bodies for him to eat but he refuses he still like hiroshi as in giants and toys will not into the death of dignity and japanese morals for this is all he really has to hold up for his survival a dignity of self hence when is dissecting a soldier for consumption he shoots him because of it tamura may be used to the killing but to the sickness of killing and pillaging he can't decipher he is neither a good man or a bad man he wishes to survive but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straight war killing his self belonged dead on the battlefield he isn't happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survival br br the sickness he carrys he sees everywhere in everyone and sadly he lacks the ethical rationale of thinking either thinking entirely about others since he can't give up his body for them since of his contagious or thinking entirely about himself since he sees the sickness in everyone though still killing them even if they do no harm seen in his attack on the two in the hut he can't see anyone no one can see anyone the only see an aversion from and an to health the heart of survival instincts br br often an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen towards what must be hope for there in that far lies their freedom yet it is blocked by american soldiers leaving the japanese to slowly die in this dirt even a church tower appears reflecting the light off an unseen sun but on closer inspection crows flutter wildly about it religion too is an air of poison br br the japanese title of the film gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film the servitude to fate the heaviness of existence under leaders and lives controlled by others its proper translation has a subject of heavy debate among historians as non koreans translate it as slave and slavery while many koreans argue that was not a slave system but a servant class system that does not meet the criteria for slavery a way to typically to escape wrenching poverty this improves upon the war theme and symbolism of br br isn't it important at the time period to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will become our won history should we be comfortable of letting it without conscious effort for change is it not who we are fighting that age old history question but rather why are we fighting fires on the plain is with osamu and mickey curtis based on a novel by shohei in japanese with subtitles
<START> the basic premise of is fairly simple several medical students put themselves at the point of death in order to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact it sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories in today's world where hollywood has to mine foreign markets for the ideas to make a horror film is one of those rare gems that show hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enough br br what separates from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not stoop to being condescending or arrogant recognises that people go to films to be entertained not to in this kind of supernatural thriller the difference this restraint makes is really incredible what's even more incredible is that julia roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play julia roberts the theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience is in force here br br the subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to intrude on their present time are done surprisingly well the moments when william baldwin's character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing that william baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction i am not sure which br br kiefer sutherland on the other hand really shines as the lead one really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why unfolds as kevin bacon's character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is it becomes clearer what the film is about we can try to change the past as much as we like but it's what we do with the present that matters most br br another good aspect of is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive elaborate visual effects quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film did not expend its budget in places where it did not need to much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending simple trick photography or stock footage sometimes the simplest things are the best br br if there is a problem with the film it's that it feels about ten minutes too short the ending seems more perfunctory than conclusive as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film up so they can bring it out at a certain market time of course many films have been left with sore spots for this very reason so shouldn't really need to be any different the hundred and fifteen minutes we do get is highly satisfactory though not overly brilliant br br i gave a seven out of ten it works well as a date flick or a kind of late night popcorn film that aside it makes a good reminder that low budget horror shows weren't always sad pieces of garbage
<START> yes this film is another remake yes this film can be considered a chick flick and yes this film is not perfect the women is however a clever modern update on the social behaviors of all women with an impressive cast of a including meg ryan debra messing annette benning and bette midler br br the film revolves around four main characters mary ryan her best friend editor in chief sylvie benning alex jada pinkett smith and edie debra messing and the out of this world female creature who is responsible for most of the film's drama named crystal eva mendez mary is trying to deal with her cheating husband who's never actually seen in the film by following the advice of both her friends and her mother candice bergen br br aside from mary there's sylvie who's torn between her social life and her professional life she has decisions to make that test her moral and ethic values then there's writer alex who's a lesbian with a lot of spunk but knows her way with words and finally edie with four girls and another baby on the way who loves children and has a heart of gold with a hidden secret revealed at the end br br together the women live for revenge rely on each other and give each other life lessons but it's the cameos by bette midler candice bergen cloris leachman carrie fisher and debi that show the cruel and usual behavior of women bergen plays ryan's mother she's tough silver tongued experienced and yet feels she could have become what her daughter does later there's fisher who shows how to blackmail and test the boundaries of selfishness morals and betrayal the gossip girl that shows no mercy for what she says and whom she says it to leachman who plays ryan's sassy housekeeper she knows her place when and where she's needed and how to deliver a good one liner finally there's midler who plays leah miller a crazy eclectic but wise hollywood agent she's the one character who gives ryan's mary an epiphany on who she truly is by discovering what do i want despite midler's scene stealing performance and memorable quotes she was underused br br but back to the film together the women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that very own question it tackles feminism what it means to be a woman fierce ruthless bad ass tacky smart sly clever shy proud ashame self conscious careless beautiful strong independent and also what it is that women want why are women the way they are it's funny modern and by all means not a masterpiece but the bottom line is it's worth the money and time to see veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women
<START> two hands is an entertaining funny story about australian lowlifes the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the of fate and circumstance in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy the main character into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more personally promising world br br the clueless jimmy portrayed with acumen by heath ledger is a kid who grew up without opportunity the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau br br the film is well directed and well acted the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film
<START> all the hype all the adds i was bummed that i missed this on the big screen where this film worked was in the little details in everything else it failed arnold has done so many better performances in the past few years i thought the days of commando and last action hero were gone from our lives sadly this film panders to the lowest common denominator and reduces arnold to a bellowing grunting face muscle that just knows how to shoot guns and blow things up in a cliche last moment and at one other time that was predictable from the start we see a glimmer of the actor that has proven he is more than what he got paid for early in his career i was unimpressed with the film as it never broke new ground or went anywhere but where you expected it to
<START> ok where do i start i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is sure if you just love beverly hillbillies and green acres bad acting and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie me personally i really like george's work and he is very talented but comedy is not his forte some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen it was a cute movie but would i pay 12 00 to see it h ll no now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money george buddy i love you but please don't do any more comedies this script is lacking a lot great concept but just didn't do it
<START> susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house the leader of said drug ring whom only has one week until retirement thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that i've sat through br br all the actors in this film can't really act in the least susan makes a pretty ineffectual hero for most of the movie she'd never escape multiple times if not for the fact that seemingly every one in the movie wants to have sex with her and she doesn't take the offensive until the last 20 minutes of the flick when she does she spouts some generic i have had enough line preach on sister that very thought ran through my mind multiple times when i was watching this br br my grade d

<START> my suggestion this movie was really intended to be a comedy wasn't it if not the producers directors actors hair should really choose another career now the guidelines of my submission requires a minimum of 10 lines how in the world can i add any more to this hmm let me see oh yes the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the crash landing scene too bad that the plane didn't hit the tanker truck a bunch of martians would have scrambled out from the wreckage obviously hiding and decided to take over the world planet and make a better movie now that would have been a great beginning br br t
<START> i thought that eastwood's most unusual role was that in the bridges of madison county but that was until i saw the beguiled he manages to pull it off giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast the direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and had there not been some plot holes which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times we would be talking about an excellent film it remains powerful nonetheless br br 8
<START> first off i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out looked interesting watched it and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan pablo di pace and omg i could not believe it this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie it is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and or florida time you can check your showtime listings by title and see it i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off you see her naked body when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on funny there are a lot of other mess ups too i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie go figure wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime ha ha good laugh i give it 1 1 2 stars c d movie
<START> 1940's cartoon banned nowadays probably because of the 'black beauty' gag in which daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse br br the whole story takes place in a bookstore where the characters of the books come to life every evening so we have among others the ugly duck daffy and the wolf of they wind up in a chase after the wolf tricked daffy with a phony duck hence the title br br and chase is all there is in this little cartoon that doesn't have any real appeal nowadays only fun if you're a true fan of the looney tunes i guess br br 4 10
