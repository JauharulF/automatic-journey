<START> this movie is beautiful in many ways the plot the depth of the characters the stunning photography and acting the like scenes of battles no computer graphics here just thousands of people someone said the story has something to do with the tragedies i find some connections with the greek tragedy tradition too br br the emperor extraordinarily acted struggles between power and love but he is forced for the greater good for the will of his ancestors to choose the power and the loneliness the hate of his subjects and as his destiny he like in antigone was a good guy before becoming emperor once gained power he has to be merciless and cruel with innocent children his mother his father etc to defend and expand the empire entrapped by power he becomes a monster overall the emperor is a majestic greek tragedy figure br br the assassin evolves towards a different direction from pure evil to heroism and morality even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics this character is really unforgettable too br br lady zhao a wonderful gong li is the morality nor by power or love or hate she is morality against power somehow like antigone her conspiracies for and against the emperor have always a moral rationale br br in conclusion a wonderful movie if you love cinema and you want to try chinese movies you can start here

<START> david cronenberg much like colleague david lynch is an acquired taste a director who plays with themes like reality perversion sex insanity and death is bound to get the most extreme from audiences he proved this with films as the fly naked lunch crash and capital x capital z and more recently spider it's best to see with a clear mind try not to read too much about the plot or it'll be ruined for you what i can tell you is that cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour living out fantasies is something people always dream of but how far can you go into it before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare those are the themes touched in an exploration of identity the human psyche physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly reality itself br br the story and directing are excellent cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world avoiding the usual pitfalls and clichÃ©s linked to stories such as this the film shows some pretty disgusting stuff but is unusually low key in the gore department in comparison to other work the shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative it's not the most intellectual movie ever but it will leave you thinking about it wondering and pretty confused br br the acting gets two thumbs up as well both protagonists jennifer jason leigh and jude law play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities the dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times but that is part of the effect cronenberg was going for to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease supporting actors as ian holm don mckellar and an especially creepy willem dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances br br this movie takes some getting used to but if you can appreciate the dark tone blood imagery and existentially warping story you'll love it
<START> the movie is a happy lullaby was made to make us sleep and thatÂ´s what we do as we dream about the top beautiful natasha henstridge no screenplay no deep characters nothing special so letÂ´s sleep
<START> it would seem we should acknowledge scandinavian cinema for more than merely the dogma 1995 movement as cooked up by the danish all those years ago den or the bothersome man in english is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface as a film alone it is a scathing comedy on society and attitudes in the post modern world we live in a world that judging by the bothersome man has reached the regions of norway and the like but along with this black comedy feel to it it would seem the film delves a little deeper and raises issues at least to me of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to uncover the truth amongst so much material in our world that perhaps seems alien to us br br this was in truth a fantastic introduction to contemporary norwegian cinema for me the film very much falls into that category of the european art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity shrouded atmosphere whilst maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that may mean one thing or another so many times we've seen films that use the set up the bothersome man adopts and so many times it's turned into a close to predictable routine revolving around a detective story or a chase story or something along those lines but this film allows its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist named andreas to explore who he is where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are br br the set up i'm talking about involves said hero arriving at a location with no prior memory or what happened before this i'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory as have all the city's inhabitants everybody in the city that andreas mixes with are of the same age same mentality and same attitude suggesting to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a purgatory devoid of any emotion feeling colour or most importantly pain br br when we first see andreas he gets off a bus which he later discovers is uncanny in its abilities and approaches a petrol station in the middle of rural nowhere he is scruffy and has a huge beard but soon he will be the opposite sporting a suit and tie clean shaven face and a home of his own complete with new job in which the film makes one of the best transforming shifts between the rural and the urban that i've ever seen but the new job as well as the new city is uneasy you can take breaks whenever you like bosses are unusually kind and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything these ideas are best put across in a cinema when andreas still a relative newbie to the city is crying and is clearly affected by a film on show but everyone else watches in stone faced style there is also the initial example when one man has jumped from a window and lies impaled on some spikes but everybody walks on by without fuss br br to back up my idea on everyone already being dead and the city acting as a sort of purgatory death and harm in general is impossible there is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb but everyone's reaction to the event is stone faced and it grows back within the hour similarly a suicide attempt involving trains later on comes to nothing and instead we get the point of view regarding what it's like to be dragged down tube tracks with invulnerability on your side the city acts as a barrier a painless society in which the masochistic need to self harm oneself is impossible a place in which sexual relations can occur and break ups equally so but both under emotion less and passion less circumstances a place in which people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to actually die the city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in 'real life' and thus the film says you cannot kill yourself twice indeed you cannot feel pain or emotion in an afterlife of purgatory br br but the film's best part is the one that sneaks up on you judging by the closing five minutes of the film and the side story that opens up involving some music coming from another man's house it would seem there is a fine line between the spaces the film dictates as and we get to see these spaces only very very briefly Â so briefly that they consist of a single shot the is a colourful kitchen with music and children playing it offers life hope emotion and happiness whereas the hell is a snowy nowhere which haunts you thanks to its hopeless build up and eerie cut off point the introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality andreas and co faced purgatory and everything that came with it the afterlife just was not ready for andreas and his adventurous mind Â and look where the thinkers end up
<START> the book is better than the film mostly because of the writer prose before i saw this film someone who had seen it told me the love depicted in this film isn't real after seeing this film i can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie goers as well frankly some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody but by the end everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art it is not specifically about love at all it uses love to reveal the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred it is about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us the critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or pleas for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene this film is also about hope and forgiveness the hope epitomized in the interracial relationship between binoche's recovering character and the indian minesweeper echoed in the buddy buddy relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying and the forgiveness epitomized in the caravaggio character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's confessions for his war crimes betrayal of country i think the film could've been made even better than it is i don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not but i agree this film is not about realistic romantic love as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet the hero talks about how a new car broken down car fast car etc i'm paraphrasing is still just a car no matter what adjective you put in front of it she replies but parental love platonic love romantic love etc are very different kinds of love this is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of or for peace not materialistic things which are usually the real reasons for wars epitomized in something most of us want such as cars let's say otherwise we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art drawings of swimmers suggesting that the seas and life supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared i believe the english patient won the oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love awards tend to go that way the relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in unfortunately this view of love may be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to get together on so many levels so ridiculous versions of mythic love are hard to get into even in daydreams which film love has always been especially in good old hollywood the film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing regardless
<START> the largest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the us took place at wrestlemania 6 over 93 000 people showed up to break the rolling stones indoor record and this event didn't disappoint at all maybe the biggest match of all time took place as the immortal hulk defended his world title against the ultimate warrior there are over 12 matches in all so you get tons of action
<START> i suppose that to say this is an all out terrible movie would be unfair but it's pretty bad the sub disney storyline involves dogs playing soccer and falling in love aw how cute the acting isn't bad but definitely could be better especially that of young canadian actor kevin zegers who during the whole movie looks embarrassed like he doesn't even want to be there anyway kids will love it but parents beware
<START> in love 2 is the third movie it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one at the risk of giving out spoilers is kidnapped and the team has to get him back nothing new there a past love of is the bad guy that was done in the second movie the battle between and ryoko and is starting to get boring the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy i personally don't know what it's makers were thinking i gave this movie a vote of 4
<START> a good ol' boy film is almost required to have moonshine car chases a storyline that has a vague resemblance to plot and at least one very pretty country gal barefoot with short shorts and a low top the pretty gal is here dressed in designer jeans but the redneck prerequisites stop there jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff he comes up way short big john is big but he isn't convincing with the bad part of his moniker bug eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades ned beatty also does his part in a small role but there is no story it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film cornball with easily predictable sentiment perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme you know the one it was made famous by jimmy dean
