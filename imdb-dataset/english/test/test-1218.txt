<START> this film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971 br br clint eastwood geraldine page and elizabeth hartman do excellent work in the film as do all the cast members br br set during the civil war the film begins when a wounded yankee soldier johnny portrayed by clint eastwood is given refuge and help at a girls academy located in the south br br the headmistress of the school ms farnsworth geraldine page the one teacher edwina elizabeth hartman and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too long br br while their loyalties lay with the confederacy their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women over to his side and keep them from turning him over to the br br however feelings previously stoked by incestuous behavior an adulterous father a brutal rape and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousies turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both johnny and the school's residents br br 10 stars
<START> we all seem to be in agreement it was an excellent show and let die way before it's time i've decided that if i really enjoy a show it's often the kiss of death i love the quirky ensemble cast shows and a great setting always helps i really expected to see a lot of these stars in other television productions but short of mariska who played fisher stephens crazy girlfriend i've not seen many of them except in occasional cameo roles what a shame br br key west northern exposure gilmore girls and veronica mars all great shows all sadly gone before their time br br hear us loud and clear we want key west on dvd please
<START> with all the shoot em up blood horror movies that have come our way in the last little while saw saw 2 the hills have eyes yes they have their place don't get me wrong i went to see when a stranger calls with my buddy the other night why because it's a remake of the 1979 classic which at the time was excellent and scared the you know what out of everyone i didn't know what to expect however i was pleasantly surprised it was a film made of mood atmosphere suspense because remember people what you can't see what you think you see what you can't hear or what you think you hear is far more scarier then what you do if you love films with mood creepiness suspense and atmosphere you'll love it it brought it back to the roots of the original halloween thumbs up a solid 8 5 out of 10 remember folks it's well done not perfect it's spooky not bloody it's creepy not gory it was nice to see a film come a long like this our minds have been conditioned and warped by the glitz and shock value of modern day horror movies we forget what's really scary
<START> what a dreadful movie the effects were poor especially by todays standards but that was forgivable what was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash the acting was awful and i mean awful the point in the story where michelle green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious they see the water approaching and run for their lives by the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make ms green look to unfit they manage to the water for some time before taking refuge what speed later a speeding car is not fast enough to escape the torrent god she and that dog did run fast if you want to watch a good movie about a dam breaking this isn't it entertainment turn out some good family films but this time they just missed the mark
<START> the show start out with the boat desmond was i it then they went to try to save walt and lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane eko tries to open the door that locked on him and charlie helped him find the bomb while sayid and jack plan is that is to find the others first and see who and what the other are and find if there armed and have any weapons br br micheal takes jack kate and hugo in a trap and they get caught br br after the show there were more questions then answers but that what makes the show great and can't wait until season 3
<START> this movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie stu unger lived an extraordinary life imagine if stu were alive today this movie paints a picture of what stu life might have felt like it was interesting to see how connected was growing up i would have liked to seen more detail on partying his and his relationship to bob but all in all this movie was well done well acted and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were larger than life br br this movie is worth renting
<START> 'it's easy to kill a monster but it's hard to kill a human being ' br br set in st thomas housing project and angola prison in new orleans dead man walking is the true story of helen susan sarandon a louisiana nun sister who befriended matthew sean penn a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage sister helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the act never before attempted by a br br at their first meeting swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his br br the film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot stabbed raped and left in the woods to die br br as execution looms closer and closer his character is seen deceptively complex harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to himÂ in one moment we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent in another we see him furious playing the victim blaming the government drugs blacks the kids for being thereÂ never understood that he has robbed the and the so much giving them nothing but they are never going to see their children again never going to hold them to love them to laugh with themÂ br br in the scenes leading up to his execution the death row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his luckily both sarandon and penn are here out successfully an exquisite tangible harmony of when sarandon was looking at penn she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tearsÂ she asks him to visualize her as he want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of that moment we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for himÂ
<START> i saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the u s nonetheless it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies it concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small british town the plot of the movie gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable br br the acting is great across the board sure to be overlooked in the crunch of blockbusters this is a movie worth looking out for i know i will try to catch this in the theaters again and or buy the video
<START> batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films its predecessor batman in my opinion is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre for one to say that batman returns was disappointing he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin devito and walken offer some memorable moments the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman batman returns provides comic relief action suspense and fantasy and it should not be viewed as 'crap' although we are all entitled to our own opinions
<START> originally the spiders was planned as a four part serial and it shows i dislike serials they're typically ridiculous convoluted and banal this one is no exception in the first part of the spiders 'the golden lake ' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals the spiders to steal gold from incas a silly love triangle ensues with some cowboys and indians action the sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me br br one can legitimately trace themes from this two part series to lang's later far superior work and the film making is better than in other serials i've seen from this time including 'les vampires' 1915 in the spiders the camera isn't as static and this film is fast paced thankfully the tinting and lighting are adequate too none of that's remarkable though it's nearly unseemly however in how closely this series resembles louis serials the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in 'les vampires' only the names and to a lesser extent the situations have changed br br for the further comments on the spiders series see the web pages for it
<START> many people are making fun out of steven seagals acting abilities and i really see why if i remember fire down below well ok his other films are acceptable regarding to his acting br br after reading reviews about the patriot i didn't expect anything from this film i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the patriot was even worse so i was really surprised about this one in my opinion it is one of his very best movies if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best i liked the story the directing and the actors belle was just incredible she will have a great movie career in the future the few action scenes were very well made and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role
<START> this is my favourite indian movie of all time it is comic genius salman khan is hilarious but amir khan steals the show with his witty dialogue karisma kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end there is not one dull moment every scene is hilarious even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter i especially loved the scene in which amar amir khan his i've seen this movie so many times i've lost count and i'm so glad to say that this time bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as i know a a a it is not a replicate of a hollywood movie thank god overall i recommend this movie to anyone who understands hindi urdu and loves good comedy br br watch it you'll love it
<START> nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible br br in the end that is what kills it the blandness is just not good i can't say i expected better from will smith but i definitely did from kevin james of the king of queens but hey i'm getting used to saying that a lot lately this film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy but it never hits the bull's eye in fact it never hits anywhere within the target the allergy scene is disturbing the fact that kevin james can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody off guard and is therefore in a movie like this not funny this movie constantly tries to win your heart but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time some parts are okay but i'm searching my brain for examples but i really think this movie should be avoided
<START> i can appreciate satire that goes against my own views but it must be witty and well placed this film is how can i possibly explain it it does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety much less intelligence in fact it's hardly even horror dead soldiers come to life but they're not interested in brains only in voting why cue a never ending stream of the most idiotic banal bloated windbag ravings of bad president bad conservatives bad republicans what a self indulgent schmaltzy cornball piece of hog manure this was br br even if they agree with the episode's points only the stupidest of liberals would say they enjoyed watching it then again assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed angry hostile anti social and anti anything halfway normal liberal spectrum is a tall task in itself br br avoid like a liberal convention
<START> garden state was a mediocre film at best the film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer zach had rather than a cohesive story the disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than quirky coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation zack walking past that turn on as he passes crazy under cranked party scene shouting over a gorge the list goes on br br the main character is flat and ultimately unlikable which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father selfishly ignoring his fathers problems including a recently deceased wife and droning on about his own what am i to do with my life problem br br the film ends when andrew zach decides not to go back to la because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life sam natalie portman whom he has known for 2 days which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas sure you could interpret it as a of priorities but if that is the case it could have been done better much better br br this film does not know what it wants to be a drama a comedy a teenage wasteland film or a gamut of other things i say this not as a single genre oriented person but as a person who loves multi genre pieces such as those mastered by stanley kubrick the reason i feel it does not work for garden state is because rather than blending the genres together it jumps around one scene is one genre the next another and back again so on br br i have heard many people tell me to cut zach some slack after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as director writer and lead actor impressive as it was a first film i should think that with as much money as he has he could do better there have been much better first time feature film directors michel gondry human nature david gordon green george washington maybe if he stuck to writing or directing or acting it would have been better zach is a talented performer maybe his second attempt won't be so tedious and disjointed
