<START> a group of four young men attending a prestigious private school belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s they each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago this new guy wants everyone's power for himself br br this not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as yes there is magic and all that supernatural stuff but this is really just an action movie a very mediocre action movie focusing almost solely on being cool and slick and paying only minimal attention to the plot which has plenty of sadly unused room for interesting twists but none were put in and even before the movie is half over you'll know what is being played and by whom br br there are a few good scenes here and there most notably an exploding car that is magically reconstructed after colliding with a big rig but that's about it what's worse is that director renny harlin who has some very entertaining if not smart movies to his credit relies heavily on blasting metal music and overly sexy leads to carry that film and that makes it quite possibly the silliest horror movie since the disastrous alone in the dark it is not as bad as alone in the dark since the few slick scenes are actually slick and not ridiculously incompetent but in the end the highest this film can hope for is a nice and cozy home on late night cable 3 10 br br rated pg 13 violent action
<START> a magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend christmas with her after a slow start it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast in a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in double indemnity stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while greenstreet is well cast as the publisher however steals the film as a chef trying to master the english language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible european accent
<START> i think this is a pretty good movie but one thing makes it very interesting to me it is blatantly obvious once you look out for it the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on the simpsons is jimbo john is and tony is dolph there is even an episode of the simpsons where jimbo uses the line i poked her with a stick br br the jimbo connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice has the shaved head unlike john but is the big dumb one the tony dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long parted haircut and even the second tier status
<START> i just spent the last half an hour reading through the other reviews and i don't know if i want to laugh or cry there's no way that is like harry potter danny phantom fairly oddparents other then a secret magical world which has been close to overdone also no way is anime anime is very much a drawing style and some will say more such as plot and japanese origin either way is not anime so stop saying it is and if you're looking for something that is like anime look else where like teen titans and avatar br br is typical it's just like all the other disney shows an arrogant main character kid who thinks he knows everything and doesn't bother to listen to people who're older than him and continues to make the same mistakes best friend sidekicks plot with a hint of a twist and sibling rivalry can't they once make a character that has brains and isn't full of himself can't they have kids respect their elders can't they think of something different with the plot can't they have the siblings get along and not hate each other is just too generic because you also have bad guys that get defeated and come back again and are also complete idiots that have no background for their hate c'mon you'll think that someone who's at least 30 will be able to out wit a 13 year old br br watching is like watching nearly anything else on tv these day same thing over and over again nothing special just new designs characters and one small idea that has been used again and again
<START> well first and for most i'd just like to say that i'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies only the movie in titled scarecrow gone wild could bring me back so here i am br br with that being said i like to start off with this comment ouch this movie was really horrible i mean i know it was going to be bad but i had no idea that i would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what i thought was a horror movie br br let's start with the biggest flaw of the film to me that is ken shamrock now if memory serves me correctly shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men now if memory serves me again he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief or that's how it looked to me i mean how else do you explain all of his lines my all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was it's been a long time coming ok the funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed so if he has knowledge of this why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it the scarecrow that it like i said before he must have been the comic relief except i don't think his buddies where laughing br br now that i've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie br br i'll admit that i can't remember a lot of scenes and that's not good considering that i just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago so what i'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1 usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music it's not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself so why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling i mean i saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type br br 2 why on earth were there murders on a beach i'm sorry but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings but i guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room i mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach it looked as if they were running in the same spot br br 3 the girl running in the gray sweat pants that really bother during the duration of this film i mean she looks so ridiculous plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group i mean what was she like twelve or something there no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera i mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something so what was her excuse br br 4 people trying to get record deals on camera just when i thought that this movie could not get any cheesier out comes the wanna be brooks and oh man was he lame i don't' remember the whole scene but from what i do remember it was not pretty this one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing and i mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film the funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this i mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the token black guy and that's sad because if i'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of american but here's where it gets funny while this guy is all into his new song or whatever in the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow and boy does he look pi ed off at this i mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy so what does he do about this jealousy well i'm glad you ask he for the guy to finish his song and then he the guy i don't want to give the death scene away but i can tell you this if that scene doesn't make you laugh then nothing on this earth will br br 5 this movie was way longer then i expected and it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film i mean i'll admit i didn't see the twist coming but that had a lot to do with the fact that i was hoping that the film was over and done with but no they had to do they twist s t needless to say that when i say that coming i just turned off the t v and said f k it there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser thanks to my rather fast judgment i can say that i'll never know what was to happen next but i promise that i do not care all and all the movie is good for a laugh but please don't buy it just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse
<START> asterix and the vikings is the first animated asterix movie in over 12 years since the 1994 asterix conquers america it also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation which makes the largely entertaining story a lot more breathtaking to behold br br every scene of this movie is vividly rendered in bright cheerful hues adhering closely to the color schemes of the comic books it was based on the character designs also stick relatively close to the comic for better or for worse preserving the simple but unique look of the characters being simple in terms of character design this allows for more time and effort to be spent on the actual animation which by the way surpasses many other big screen theatrical animated movies character movements are very fluid and possess a quality that looks way beyond what a modest budget would usually produce there is always something moving in every scene and no evidence of the usual cost cutting animation short cuts 3d computer images are incorporated seamlessly with the traditionally animated 2d art if anything the style of shading makes the 3d elements look more like traditional comic book paintings than cgi models br br the storyline takes much of its elements from the asterix and the comic and this is where its main flaw lies as an adaptation of said comic asterix and the vikings takes way too many liberties with its source material long time fans of the comic would no doubt find much to dislike about the movie's story and its lack of adherence to the source br br on the other hand one can see this story as a really fun one if taken on its own without comparing it its source material highly comedic well written jokes pepper the upbeat script the funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and jibes at modern day 21 century life mobile communications the shopping channel commercial airlines and even sports cars are spoofed to great effect excellent chemistry and acting by the cast i watched this in english by the way though a couple of voices like i found really irritating but i guess it is all part of his character br br if there is anything to criticize about the story it is the lack of asterix this story seems to be more like story of teenage romance and coming of age with asterix and merely playing supporting roles this gives a pretty big sense of staleness since much of the story's elements are the usual staples of such teen movies derivative and clichÃ©d at times only the witty comedy and traditional elements the romans the pirates etc manage to save this film from falling into plain mediocrity br br while not the best installment in the asterix animated movie library it is certainly one of the funniest the best scripted and the most beautifully animated dvd seems a little hard to come by
<START> many funny scenes about the people that you don't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do lou myers was very funny as half step wilson any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie
<START> you get an hour and a half of braindead i have to save the world action all the way one liners and a woman somewhere in the equation this time he plays a guy who help people in the witness protection program to quote the cover of the movie he erases their past to save their future this have to be cool i bet younger people will like it though but it is a little over the top for my taste and the one liners are really something else and i don't mean that in a good way after killing a crocodile he manage to say you're luggage if you are in the right mood you may enjoy the movie and as far as braindead action go this is not very bad but almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen but if you like these kind of movies you will probably enjoy this one i rate this movie 4
<START> closet land is not at happy movie neither is it connected to any kind of social realism this is perhaps its strength the distance from specific time and nations strengthens the message makes it more powerful and rips away the burden of nationalism and propaganda you often sense in movies made to criticize nations in of ones own i am of course primarily speaking of the usa propaganda in some commercial film br br bit closet land is so much more than a message it is a film of pure surrealistic beauty filled with the same clean clinical form you find in work such as 1984 and it's equals br br i am of old a big fan of alan rickman the man with the golden sarcasm and i might add the sex appeal the between him and madeleine stowe is brilliant everytime i see him he seems to play a character even nastier than the last one br br but enough the film lacks in action i dont want any crashing cars but i want something to happen except pure talk after an hour i got really tired of the the predictable actions and more than anything i wanted a more complex view of it all the world the former lives of the characters and all the rest of the framework that was missing for some people a nice touch for me something less positive br br anyway closet land is a movie worth it's time if you are ready to make a trip into the abyss of the human nature br br and of course for us who really loves the always evil alan rickman
<START> i really felt the movie was ahead of its time the one potential daughter in law was such a strong career oriented woman she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the over bearing mother in law to be the mother's role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her her need to control her son's lives was neurotically evil if you've ever been in a relationship where you've been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home it's been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50's or 60's movie it is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons' dynamic but i would love to watch it again i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck attempts to buy it were also futile i don't believe it's on tape or dvd
<START> for many and many years gaijin have visited japan for learning martial arts instead of acquiring any knowledge on it have been told only could achieve the excelent performance required to show some techniques in a public performance such as a movie br br this one special movie made by sho kosugi not only shows all of those techniques and skills but also teaches many and many lessons on how to achieve them and one can verify that by seeing a lucinda dickey performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills in br br i strongly recommend watching this movie more than thrice because three times is not enough to seek out hints and tips given so easily by sho kosugi to those who really seek knowledge itself the
<START> i'm big into acting writing and directing but not famous yet my friends and i frequently rent bad movies just for fun and a good laugh but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called biker zombies from detroit we knew it was gonna be the worst movie of all time and it was biker zombies from detroit has no script they can say they do have one but they're liars there was a 4 minute scene of just two guys riffing about women and sexuality and you could tell it was improvised and if they're going to improv it should be at least decent but it wasn't and you could tell by the two actors screwing up lines and saying stuff that didn't even make sense br br to give you an idea of how terrible and retarded this movie is here's the beginning a girl flicks a guy off he punches her in the face and beats her up then rapes her then we see zombies who attack and they both turn into zombies br br this is the beginning of the movie not to mention the lead zombie voice over that carries through the whole movie trying to be sinister and thought provoking but sounding like marylin manson having a conniption fit br br worst movie ever bottom line folks but watch it if you like movies with no script no plot bad acting bad editing bad music and over 100 f words used in the movie br br if this can hit video stores my future films are gonna win oscars
<START> a group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine but by taking the gold and thinking they've hit it big they awaken a long dead miner who's hell bent on protecting his treasure miner's massacre is a chintzy b horror movie in the extreme you've got all your familiar clichÃ©s your group of intellectually impaired teenagers characters going off on their own to investigate strange noises a few pop scares the mysterious sheriff the old lady who everyone thinks is nuts played by top billed karen black no less and so on nevertheless it's done in an amusing non pretentious fashion that makes the film mindlessly entertaining in a so bad it's good kind of way the characters and dialog are what you'd expect from this type of routine and unoriginal the actors all do a decent job though actually seen bigger budget films of it's type with worse acting i know what you did last summer anyone and add a bit of credibility to the film itself the villain in this film the is obviously derived from the creeper from jeepers creepers all the way down to the brown overcoat the hat and the long white hair like the creeper he never talks and is butt ugly to boot the gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion there are a couple of fairly gruesome moments but too much is off screen and the death scenes are often laughable spoiler ahead there's one truly hilarious moment where a girl gets decapitated by the said villain and to achieve this the filmmakers hid the actress's body beneath the villain's coat with her head poking out and put some fake blood on her neck seriously you could see the outline of her shoulders i think they could have done a little better there even if the budget was low and i'm sure it was but the special effects are cheap but sufficiently effective and for the most part moderately well done for a low budget film either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire almost every scene towards the end of the film has at least a couple of characters being burn to death always filmed in slow motion or something exploding be it a car or an old mine cave seriously hasn't anyone ever heard the term stop drop and roll br br miner's massacre or curse of the forty what ever you want to call it is cheesy and dumb albeit entertaining and as long as you don't have expectations through the roof you'll be sufficiently entertained br br i'm feeling generous so i'll give it a 4 10
<START> i was completely bored with this film melodramatic for no apparent reason every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill one person to get the title of serial killer well the serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films br br why oh why i no idea it really really wants to be scary but i think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noises just for the record this is in no way is a horror film its most definitely a thriller barely really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making horror films or at least calling a movie a horror film it makes me say in too may words ironically acolytes you take forever to say nothing
<START> after all these years of peter o'tool's brilliant costly giving of his soul film after film at last hollywood tosses him an oscar recently br br country dance showed up one night late and of course blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged life how does he do it br br york again also is brilliant in this kind of play both psychological battleships loaded for bear br br bravo to author director cast and camera crew no wonder the nazi's lost to these irish scot english blends brutal honesty hurts back in the 70's when i personally believed honesty was pure and absolutely vital to trust i have modified my edgy extremes and will settle for more human warm flaws within myself and others br br forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes
