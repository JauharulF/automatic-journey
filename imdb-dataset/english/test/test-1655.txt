<START> i suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be cool but looking back now 45 years it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value granted the special effects do well on t v with the series that started in 1964 but for the big screen i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the obviously not well staged or trained overall it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it for fun laughs sake this was probably one of irwin allen's biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it eden went on to play genie on t v micheal was her husband now that is a cool part about this film i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie neat
<START> can u believe a college professor made this film br br the same man who made br br the film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever br br the main message is nice but presented badly br br the film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes etc and bad performances br br direction and everything is poor br br music is okay br br naughty streak works and he does well tusshar is bad tanushree and isha are bad paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror

<START> some might remember if having seen the film juno a scene where ellen page has a moment of praise for dario argento's suspiria her favorite horror film jason character then asks if she's ever seen a herschel gordon lewis film and to wit he has a copy of a movie i forget which at the moment and shows it to her at the time i saw juno i had seen suspiria and a few argento films but not lewis now i can see that it's not just another one of diablo cody's pop culture in references but something that actually is an indicator on the tastes of the characters and maybe more subjectively how to judge them based on their tastes in other words herschel gordon lewis's reputation is maintained some many years after he ended making his gore films and it's that of a schlock meister no more no less actually less br br it's interesting then to take argento as a basis of comparison because both filmmakers approach at least in the case of the gore gore girls and well any given argento picture similar material where argento is extraordinarily conscious about his craft getting an audience wrapped up in whatever little story there is by the power of the movement of camera and music and style lewis takes the easy route to get at an audience which is with an immature script and putting it lightly lackluster direction the gore gore girls reveals a filmmaker who isn't interested in entertaining his audience in an actual compelling way as a horror film but as a side show or a brothel he can't direct actors worth a damn he lights like it's a porno movie and for every one possibly clever or funny one liner there's ten that either totally stink or are too clever by half or not clever nearly enough br br that being said perhaps as the best substantive thing to say about the gore gore girls a mystery movie about a detective 2nd rate sherlock holmes guy played by somewhat amusing frank and a newspaper reporter amy farrell investigating a series of murders of go go dancers is that it serves as the template for countless more troma style pictures perhaps this is faint praise however and really the best thing that can truly be said is that henny youngman take my wife please has a few scenes and steals every one of them without having to try much it's sad since it could be the kind of picture that could entertain on an awesomely bad level but even on that score one may laugh more out of embarrassment for the production some of the actors i e that guy who plays the cop my god than out of some guilty pleasure enjoyment br br even the gore itself is somewhat of a letdown at first one thinks that lewis is at least delivering on this end showing these women being murdered in crazy and vicious and exaggerated ways but with the killings it all goes on longer than necessary i don't mean this in terms of shock value for that it's fine but there needs to be something else to really make it stick that showing women's faces dissected and eyes gouged is fine if you're 12 and seeing this as one of you're first 'horror' films it becomes dare i say it dull dangerously dull for such a daring so called movie br br this was lewis's last film until 30 years later an apparently worthy swan song came with a sequel to a film he made earlier brought him out of his retirement from movies and job in writing books on how to make it in business however whatever experience he had coming up to this one doesn't show it's not a failure but it could have been and it's just simply schlock take it or leave it
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen completely ridiculous the story is bad the animations are completely childish and displaced the physics of the holograms are hilarious from how much they are completely wrong omg i even wanna believe that this film has disney label on it yuck the actresses are somewhat beautiful but there are so many good films with astonishing actresses that are far more valuable to see than this one final remark bad film don't bother to watch it if you're looking for films to see with your kids consider other alternatives like monster inc or an enchanted story on theaters seriously
<START> the world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing in which objects such as dvd and cd players are steadily in size it is obviously much cooler to have a smaller ipod than a larger one this is not so with theater screens as is the case with the imax the enormous widely known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release and to this day as long as the material's right br br the main problem with desolation walking on the moon 3d is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage it is dull uninformative and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as neil armstrong and buzz aldrin another problem with the film is that it doesn't even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon instead the writers have simply pressed copy and paste and hired famous voices such as morgan freeman bill paxton and matt damon to imitate their famous quotes this tactic is unrelentingly repetitive and tedious br br i'd say without one moment's hesitation that i didn't learn one piece of information from the film that i didn't already know br br and it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its insistent sentimentality every three minutes there seems to be a cue for tom hanks' voice to say something like without the contributions of these brave men and women watching the film is like watching a bad commercial for forty agonizing minutes br br 1 4
<START> there's a third man look to the shadowy b w photography of stolen identity a thriller produced by turhan bey ex star of universal pictures during the '40s it's an expertly filmed tale of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist francis lederer becomes overly possessive of his wife joan and is soon intent on carrying out a scheme to murder a man she's having an affair with br br a taxi driver donald happens to be giving the woman's lover a lift to the hotel when he steps outside a moment to chat with a worker digging up the street lederer uses the sound of the drill to the sound of the bullet he puts in the head of the passenger from outside the back of the car when returns to his cab he finds a dead man in the passenger seat br br to report the murder to the police he changes his mind and decides to switch identities with the dead man who has an american passport which means could realize his ambition to return to the united states the stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man's girlfriend wife shows up at the hotel to accuse of impersonating the dead man br br it's the sort of plot movie goers have probably seen countless times but it gets a nice workout here with plenty of tense scenes as and wife plan how to run from the authorities until a final confrontation with the murderer and the police br br it's extremely absorbing well done and holds the interest throughout with some excellent atmospheric photography of vienna that will remind most movie goers of the third man br br well worth viewing
<START> okul the school is a result of a new trend in turkish cinema having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas of course it doesn't mean that they are all grand i think okul is one of them it is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not it is not successful on being scary either so what is it actors are so average especially deniz is pretty annoying with the teacher role i am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa but directors have missed the target this time out of
<START> mike nichols in finest form i was not a fan of closer so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but nichols and his very strong a list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling congressman br br philip seymour hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant here playing a damaged but ultra smart cia manipulator and it is in the exchanges between hanks and hoffman's characters where the comedy soars rarely is movie humour laugh out loud and also smart this hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world often simultaneously br br one other major plus is the length of the picture the film is based on george fat book of the same title the temptation for screenwriter aaron his claim to fame is the west wing must have been to make a fat movie but what we get is a breath taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications br br this film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that herring and wilson provide and the ultimate consequences 9 11
<START> i like the wind and the lion very much it was a good movie i thought that since i'm young and it was made so long ago i wouldn't like it all that good but after i saw it i was amazed of how good it was my family liked it my friends liked it everyone i showed it to liked it i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in was treated during the early 1900's by the germans french and even the americans if i was a high school history teacher i would definitely show it to my student's from a high schooler's point of view i give this movie a good 10 out of 10 my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves my little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it br br
<START> in my opinion this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography too bad the story is not all that good and mr cage sometimes loses his accent but two thumbs up for lighting and the dp
<START> i would give this movie an 8 5 or a 9 i thought it was just straight up hilarious i don't know how you could not think this movie was funny but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was alittle bit too much gross stuff because personally i think when they fly off of bikes and stuff like that is much funnier but i'm sure there are people that think the other things are very funny so that is not my but anyways great movie go see it and after that you should definitely go buy it also if you do not like this movie that is fine because i'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how downgrading our society is or whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours also the jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading or buying or whatever you do to get your videos
<START> this is a black and white film from france br br simple plot gangster on the run seeking getting help etc we have seen this type film many times over the years what makes this film different are mainly its acting style all the actors perform quietly no one yells hardly anyone loses his temper there are quite a few deaths some surprising there are beautiful women as well but no sex scenes no car chases either br br just talking it is so refreshing to listen to people talk here we must read subtitles as well br br the acting is near perfect by all especially the lead played by br br lino ventura in a smaller but vital role jean paul belmondo these 2 actors were among the best br br i said above the film is flawed there are a few script deficiencies in few spots they are minor the acting is the thing in this movie production is first rate as well br br ratings out of 4 88 points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10
