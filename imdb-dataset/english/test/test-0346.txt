<START> a film about an interesting and sensitive period of history filmed in beautiful surroundings managed to present an appallingly trivial and clichÃ©d production grossly clumsy script poor continuity intrusive slushy music sugary casting and pallid acting br br it was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse the script probably won the historical background backstory and character descriptions were spelt out in painful detail in the dialogue actually words can't describe quite how bad this film is br br in a pre release screening there was a massive exodus from about thirty minutes in at about an hour many of those who remained were laughing loudly i should add i am a francophile i am fascinated by canada and love historical film this really was a one off
<START> this is a great show despite many negative user reviews the aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number simple the fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal br br some appear to hate the show for various reasons but i think they misunderstood this as an educational show on how to pick up chicks well it is not it is a comedy show and the whole point of it is to make you laugh not teach you anything if you didn't like the show because it doesn't teach you anything don't watch it if you don't like the whole clubbing thing don't watch it if you don't like socializing don't watch it this show is a comical show if you down by watching others pick up girls well its not making you laugh so don't watch it if you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to pick up girls there is no reason to hate the show simply don't watch it
<START> i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in our program as an old shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party i wasn't sure if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the idea of a suicide party it sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that i did it was not dry and boring in the least that dialogue was great funny in a clever way but not pretentious and difficult to understand peter falk was terrific in this role he stole the show i also was pleasantly surprised by laura san performance usually she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in this film very much i think judge part could have been done better by another actor at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not like you were just watching this character but the movie was so good i was able to forgive one actor's awkwardness i would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public who knew suicide could be so hilarious
<START> the 1998 version of psycho needed to be set back in the 60's rather than present day the headliners would have done a good job with the setting there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane anne heche was sitting at her desk her boss took his client into his office because it was air conditioning i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning the other was the meeting of lila crane julianne moore sam loomis viggo mortensen lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater
<START> tries so hard tries to be light hearted tries to be a comedy tries to be a love affair let's see it tries to be a 'his girl by way of 'the by way of 'it happened one night' by way of a dozen sports movies alas trying isn't doing and the movie is as soggy as the last game's field br br a fan of movies would watch the big fight scene in the speakeasy between the and some soldiers and realize that the fights that john ford staged with such style and verve and humor in movies like 'the quiet man' or or 'the may have seemed easy to do but obviously aren't i would bet george clooney thought channeling john ford would be easy as well how hard could it be masculinity run amok punches bottles broken over heads an imperturbable piano player just put it up there on the screen with some happening music sorry it takes a master to make fight scenes flow br br movies aren't wished into existence humor is hard romance is hard slapstick a lost art br br i once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance something about not wanting to prick the fantastic bubble of the performance by hearing the thuds of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the lifts this movie is like that all strain and good intentions handsome actors nice sets but it thuds through its paces rather than gallops like the original galloping ghost red grange who the movie is loosely based on
<START> imagination must of slipped jim wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far i did enjoy seeing jay richardson and ann gilbert get eaten gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits my husbands sentiments jerri should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff unbelievable and she just a plain boor liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy at least we know the next plot giant snake man slays komodo before becoming daddy to a nest of eggs jerri would be great as the mother cobra sit back with a 6 pact or a couple of joints it will ease the pain
<START> when i saw the first preview for this i nearly passed out from excitement i have long been a fan of twelfth night it turned me on to shakespeare so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true my anticipation was not disappointed br br the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means complicated i don't want to even try to relate it the plot summery will probably cover the basics just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create i will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot reality is not the point of the film br br what it is though is absolutely hilarious nearly every scene nails the comedic set up kudos to the writers director and actors on that count br br amanda bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully she's super cute not a vixen and can do faultless comedy i admire her so much for not going full on tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do i'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood ok i'm off my soap box br br channing tatum yeah he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla but he really makes me laugh my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when he's trying to converse with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimen br br the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane dÃ©butante mother and monique the classic evil girlfriend br br overall lots of fun of laughs and a highly attractive cast maybe not on par with the original but it beats out modern versions of other plays including the much touted 10 things i hate about you
<START> the people of my generation and those who are older know about the ww ii or as it is called in russia â the great patriotic war not only from the school textbooks but from the witnesses and participants of the event my granddad was a soldier at stalingrad and when i was a small girl i used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the germans he also told me some anecdotes not all he told me was gloomy but it was long ago and no when i have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of stalingrad i have to turn to books and movies for information somehow most films i saw were made in the soviet union only a few in present day russia and is an exception in the movie the war is described from the opposite side and the fact in itself is interesting all that is shown in the film is quite different from what iâm used to br br the film reminds me a great deal of zu leben und zu because the war is shown through an ordinary german soldier perception and this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist the movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic europe from the italian coast arrive in the snow covered hungry soviet union they are doomed to die it is clear from the very beginning br br after the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at stalingrad one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me he said you start thinking you will go and to my mind it is true for spectators as well from the one hand one may think ok just watch this movie and it dissipate me i feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa however sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing execution br br is hard to watch all these frostbitten legs dirt executions snow famine destroyed illusions br br as far as i know lt hans von is one of the few films where thomas kretschmann played his star roles i watched quite many hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries such as or why did he do it and after i had watched i cannot make out the european actors desire to appear in american movies even second rated at any cost the fact puzzles me deeply i believe thomas kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in hollywood and out of what i saw with him is the best beyond the doubt br br in my opinion the worst drawback is the way they speak russian in the movie i mean of course those who are supposed to be russian say the boy who spent some time with the germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent initially i set down to watch just to listen to native german speakers because iâm studying the language i did not expect anything extraordinary of the film but it impressed me made me cry when i wasnât going to at all i know iâm 15 years late to watch it but is not a run of the mill movie and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking
<START> this story of the troubles caused by an over possessive overpowering domineering and unscrupulous mother laura hope crews for her two grown sons and their girls is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by irene dunn the new daughter in law joel mccrea the number one son eric linden the number two son and frances dee fiance of number two son here's the show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their owns lives damaged their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy irene dunn is stellar in her role joel performance is open and clear and laura hope crews is masterful as the mother br br yet this reviewer finds frances dee's performance the best of all hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings her portrayal in her heartbreak broken engagement scene is gut wrenching and even raw dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face br br frances dee like laura hope crews has been too long overlooked and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was no actress who started in film after wwii has had anything to speak of on frances dee br br if you're lucky enough to see the silver cord which was never released for tv you'll find this old fashioned drawing room drama to be an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances
<START> i saw this as a kid before it had been yanked from the rotation and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth there were some competently worked out gags but making slapstick villains out of american citizens who'd been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless br br moe himself might have wanted this one buried he was a liberal guy in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated south where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close moe stepped into the street to show it wasn't a problem and the man then got back on the curb then off again finally the man told moe nervously that if moe didn't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him he might get them both lynched br br another thing there are exploding ostrich eggs but no in the film so the title should actually be if anyone cares the on me
<START> this is a top car flick its a work of art yer a work of art all classic cars no plastic fantastic i have watched it over over again i have worn out two video tapes and will wear out lots more lots more car lovers young or old will love this film watch it more than 1 time so hire it or buy it just see it i wish they would make more car movies like this power not gassed up little snippers br br shes a right motor magic the heap the chariot br br you've got to learn to feel the power
<START> i own this movie and it is terribly hard to find it is a unique low budget little gore flick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion it has the really humourous low budget feel to it and the gore is suprisingly good for what appears to be a 500 budget the director is claimed to be the master of gore i wouldn't go that far but maybe in his time he was overall 6 10 on the gore chart
<START> in the century an architect by the name of merchant bruce ramsay a space station which he personally designed as can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put merchant into custody upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious during interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood in order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space br br the movie that is essentially the same to hellraiser that the was to highlander something to be ignored and forgotten as so it won't influence the lore of hellraiser to much by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low grade feel to it than its predecessors who let's face it were b or c class films br br acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid budget porn flick with wooden unbelievable performances that actually have you thinking so when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse surprisingly not much sex in the movie albeit the introduction of the seductress demon angelique a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of hellraiser offers ample opportunities for the love making br br basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories one in the future one in the present and one in the past which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion the end result is extremely poor basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film br br some decent gore in the flick but apart from that an utter failure
<START> snow queen is based of course on the fairy tale of the same name collected in at least andersen's fairy tales and unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales this one retains the spirit of faerie an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many especially among americans talking animals arbitrary prohibitions appearances of goblins dragons and demons are not to be questioned in a fairy tale they are as natural an element of faerie as say gravity is in the scientific world and the reason or explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story nor is the story bound by modern hollywood rules of composition direct often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works and obvious in retrospect at least br br with this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales snow queen is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects skillful acting and great sentiment the only flaw in the movie was i think not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression a mar on its otherwise timeless nature
<START> roy anderson's film 'you the living' comprises a series of fifty odd sketches snapshots and vignettes set in a swedish city some characters are on screen for just a few second whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds many scenes are drawn from the dreams nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world it is a fascinating approach each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human br br for the first half hour or so 'you the living' is gloriously funny much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block the comic highlight however is provided by a dinner party track gone horribly awry after this hilarious introduction however the mood of the film darkens considerably the dinner party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film br br in the subsequent scenes the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another where talk of dreams nightmares and fantasies is widespread but where no person can be comforted even when others reach out to help them the despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist are archetypal characters br br the world of 'you the living' is also blighted by selfishness an elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous money grubbing son a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a muslim barber and receives his comeuppance in the film's bleakest moment a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time br br and yet for all dark moments in this film the shared refrain of is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries the soundtrack provided by benny anderson of abba fame seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere br br 'you the living' has an extraordinary visual style the same washed out pale green colours recur throughout and there is nary a shadow in sight this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame as if these are photographs being brought to life the few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the scene in the most intense moments of longing and despair the characters the viewer by directly facing the camera Â they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us the viewers br br this is a wonderful human film
