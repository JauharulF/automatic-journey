<START> my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival it was great stormy is a strong black woman and nana reminds me of my grandmother br br rene is fine seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission can someone forward me his contact info br br my friend thinks flex is the finer of the two she's been a flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased the cousins were funny and just as trifling as nana described them lol br br i am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters
<START> now before people start having a breakdown about this movie those who play rugby anyway this is a film it's been given the hollywood treatment to entertain people and therefore those who play rugby myself included are naturally gonna pick holes in the choreography of the game in the film it is a decent film and bring to the attention the morals and ideas behind the game of rugby br br the film is based on a real team a real coach and his work helping guide kids in the right direction to be better people in the future and also is based on real people who have played for the highland team its just a typical sports movie with a character who is misguided and eventually finds his way on the right track again through the rugby medium in this case is generally a feel good movie that is enjoyable but has flaws in terms of it's portrayal of the game however like i said it is a film under the hollywood treatment
<START> again like many other tv shows a certain actor actresses in thrust into the limelight in this case miranda cosgrove having built up her reputation in previous movies series especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider she is now the star of the show gets to sing the soundtrack which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that wonderful it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co stars especially nathan who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode except want to fight music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song which was not written by her and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby let's not forget that she lip sync sings her song live too is that how you create vocalist nowadays br br back to the show cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out bras and seen in many cases though not of the other actresses are mentioned panties have been mentioned once og let us not forget oh my god a come phrase are any of the scriptwriters actors christian granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids i'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female especially in the first episode where the phrase pointy boobs were mentioned i'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home in school afterwards br br it's not that i'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments which girls will wear but for a show from nickelodeon the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them br br as mentioned is other reviews the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts for example when the character sam cries how on earth is that a time to laugh it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence br br as mentioned cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down see http www youtube com watch v mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry compare the popularity of her new single vs covers as noted the third co star nathan is the least noted of the lot he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on carly cosgrove beyond that isn't breaking into the music industry and as fame grows with each episode falls behind i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors br br the content of the show is of course fictional but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times thus the laughter track is used it also contains several continuity errors how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine us special forces have their own branches and the air force doesn't use us submarines that is for seals a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy br br once again it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments exposure of skin and over used laughter tracks it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs actions are excessive supported by her fans leaving her co stars behind
<START> this 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel we wanted to see another film which supposedly was starting but because a mix up rent a cop was shown in that time slot never having seen it when it was commercially released we took a chance at it bad decision br br one wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with rent a cop or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution it appears this movie misfired big time this film doesn't add anything new to its genre it's totally predictable as once the basic premise is shown we know how it will end br br burt reynolds plays a wooden church this actor can do better but who knows what was going on behind the scenes or perhaps the direction given to him by jerry london had the opposite effect mr reynolds has one expression throughout the movie he just doesn't register any emotion at all br br lisa minnelli as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the chicago hotel makes no sense at all the romance between her della and church seems phony from the beginning she and mr reynolds play one dimensional characters br br don't waste your time with this turkey
<START> perhaps one of the best movies ever made orry and friendship runs deep and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship as a southerner i can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets brothers fighting brothers can you imagine what life must have been living during those times the best part of the movie for me was when the south surrenders general grant is urging president lincoln to really stick it to the south he says mr president a lot of folks want the south to bleed over what they've done president lincoln turns to him and in a very tired voice says the south has bled enough and so have we i burst into tears and take a deep breath what a president it's like a father saying his son has been punished enough and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made this war was a very dark time for our young country and it had to be fought president lincoln knew this i'm urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to your dvd collection then thank god that our country was preserved as jesus said a house divided against itself cannot stand
<START> i saw the biopic of ed wood many years ago tim burton payed loving homage to this extremely untalented but yet enthusiastic filmmaker br br then i saw plan 9 and it actually tickled me to no end a silly story kind of bad production values but still entertaining and even funny br br then this what can you make of it well since wood has been reported as being a cross dresser it is startling to see a movie that deals with it like a cartoon yes there are some stabs at teaching the audience something about the subject but mostly this is some kind of really twisted self parody br br one of it's problems is that it has a hundred points of view on one hand it is a plea for tolerance another portrays transvestism as a disease and finally it tells the audience okay if you are now then wait until you see this the problem must have been that wood had to compromise in order for the film to be made you can almost sense it when you see the opening title from the producer personally supervised by so where are we this is neither a serious subject movie or an all out br br the entertainment value is practically nil the wooden voice over is mildly amusing but only because it sounds so misguided this was made in the 50s though so one can argue that was brave making a film that even mentioned the word transvestites it all comes down to what the film itself is trying to advocate against the rape scene while mild is there simply to do that br br so sorry this is a misfire but the discredit is not wood's alone
<START> i have to agree with the previous reviewer although the kristin did a great job of playing the possessed girl i seriously don't think that isabelle the character she was playing was possessed i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not i also had to watch some parts of it over again to make it clear as to what the letter said what the characters' names were and i'm still not clear on a few things that happened whether they were real or not i'm trying to find the original story that it was based on to compare facts but i can't seem to find anything about it online br br it wasn't a bad movie but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy special effects wise the movie wasn't bad for a grade b pretty much and those possession scenes made it all worth while that is if you have nothing better to do lol
<START> national lampoon's christmas vacation 2 cousin eddie's island adventure 2003 randy quaid miriam flynn dana barron jake thomas sung hi lee eric idle fred willard ed asner d nick embarrassing direct to video flop has oafish cousin eddie and family on an expenses paid vacation to the south pacific by his boss hoping the dunce won't sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey idiotic spin off can't measure up to any of the vacation films even european vacation with a question of whether or not the filmmakers thought the script was actually funny not even quaid willard or asner can make it remotely watchable 83 min not rated
<START> rigoletto is verdi's masterpiece full of drama emotion and powerful memorable music the maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but gilda as a horny ditz opera certainly can be adapted to cinema look at magnificent la traviata but when a work is as superb as rigoletto it doesn't need cheap gimmicks it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that
<START> critters 4 is a good movie a bit of a twist to the series as it takes place in space not in an earthly community good effects and acting make this movie a must see i would recommend this to horror science fiction fans everywhere br br 10 out of 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive sleep away camp slumber party massacre and other full moon pictures flicks for other recommendations check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section
<START> i've watched hundreds of kung fu movies and i've heard some good thing about this movie so i decided to give it a try what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making i've ever seen br br i can't help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie everyone overacts to the point of stupidity even conan the barbarian had some civility this movie just has half evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self respect the narrator's character should've be killed for sucking so much she really didn't deserve to live til the end the entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action they should've just rename this movie to 'the stupid one armed caveman with a blade here's a question why do some director use quick cuts for some action movies answer to can hide the deficiencies of the actors nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow the movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung fu movies or any taste in movies
<START> this is a stunning movie raw and sublimely moving it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences all of the main players are mesmerising tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike julian fellowes has triumphed again he's a national treasure gosford park vanity fair mary poppins and now this can he do no wrong go and see it this is a film for real grown ups
<START> caroline bender hope lange is just killing time getting a job her real ambition is to marry eddie and have a baby br br april diane baker is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily a dangerous combo br br greg suzy parker is a go getter and wants to be an actress br br all three are doomed for dramatics in 'the best of a 1959 soap opera morality play sometimes solid movie that is aging by the second br br set in the cut throat world of paperback publishing its not as trashy as valley of the dolls but not as vanilla as three coins in the fountain br br the men in the mix brian stephen boyd louis and robert evans are slick well dressed and no good for the most part is the resident sexual offender will pinch anything walking by and makes unwanted advances right and left his character is offensive as hell but its not played seriously at all harassment hadn't been discovered yet i guess boyd works there too although you never see him actually doing anything he's too busy being older wiser and evans is abroad just so diane baker can suffer in style he's a rich kid who's gotten her in so instead of marrying her as promised he's taking her to get an ' br br is a director who mistakenly has an affair with parker they share a fight scene which is fairly no holds barred in a movie like this anyway but the scene is ultimately ruined by parker's she ends up nearly stalking him and she really didn't deserve such a lousy fate her bad acting notwithstanding br br joan crawford breathes fire as amanda farrow the resident 'witch' who is automatically rude and dismissive of any of her legion of secretaries well they are younger aren't they isn't that sufficient reason to hate a person caroline doesn't think so as she admirably stands up to miss farrow every chance she gets crawford only gets to let loose once when she tells her married boyfriend 'you can your rabbit faced wife can both go to hell' and slams down the phone you never get to see the poor soul who dare crosses her br br martha as it were is extremely weak and she is painfully over the top as an unmarried mother short of wearing a huge w for on her cardigan she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time even worse she is not given the courtesy of having it all up' one way or the other at the end it won't matter that much but still br br its painfully obvious this all took place in a totally different world people were nicer to one another for the most part and work was not a drag but something exciting for a girl from outside nyc anyway br br one unconvincing drunk scene aside hope lange helps it seem reasonably real as caroline who at least has more than one side to her character br br i admire that women are seen having an opinion a chance and a choice not that its not wrapped in a nice bow but it makes some points for equality in 1959 that was probably noteworthy and possibly controversial 7 10
<START> japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own while that may be true it applies to all except for one thing that being major league baseball but not to worry mr baseball is there to try and change all that but just who will change whom is the part of the movie that really makes it rock tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines on in his comedic roles the storyline may be true to life however the subplot is dead on the japanese people are a gentle respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable funny film it's definitely worth the watch
<START> now i realize that most people on here trash young warriors or hail it as so bad it's funny type entertainment but let me make something clear it's actually a quality piece of low rent action if you're willing to watch such cinema without a critical eye in fact it's a good deal more entertaining and thought provoking than the bulk of the action films of the 80s br br the key is in the film's subject matter i'm always a sucker for movies that tackle the subject of vigilantism especially when they ambitiously probe into the psyches of the characters involved young warriors may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first death wish film and yes i do think the first one had both of those elements but it's trying to be different from the run of the mill cannon films of the period in that it's genuinely unique br br the plot is simple don't worry there won't be spoilers a group of college student pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is assaulted by a tough street gang the students take to the streets in an effort to combat general street crime being that they don't know who the gang responsible is they eventually acquire some heavy artillery machine guns and grenades and prowl the night fully armed however these are not schwarzenegger types they're vulnerable inexperienced novices who make sizable blunders nearly each time they set out to clean up the city usually with their frat mascot dog in tow they finally figure out who the gang is and go after them but by then you won't be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys walk away unscathed br br one thing about the film that struck me as strange yet effective is that the bulk of the first act offers no indication that we'll be seeing any action or violence later on as it's treated like a goofy frat comedy you'd see on usa's up all night where i believe this was actually shown at one point the comedy set up actually lulled me into forgetting that the vhs cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back then when the violence finally arrives it's not fun or cute at all it's shockingly disturbing from that point on the film becomes a full blooded uncompromising action yarn containing some startling gunfights and gore br br the acting while nothing special is far more impassioned than i anticipated james van patten who plays the protagonist gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie the rest of the cast is equally invested including the always dependable ernest borgnine as the hero's cop father the cinematography is also above par and the action scenes are handled with a level of severity that i personally wasn't expecting br br i can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated but those facets struck me as nothing short of cool in and of themselves van character is studying animation and his patently early 80s style work that's on display in several scenes is a retro film lover's psychedelic wet dream i'm sure most contemporary viewers would cite those very moments as low points in the movie but i disagree also joe walsh's soundtrack which sounds like it could have only been recorded in '83 seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable regardless of how old it seems today br br young warriors is one of my favorite action films of the 80s and i highly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look sadly however it's only been released on vhs as of this writing and it isn't being shown on tv these days a nice dvd presentation would make me moon walk around my living room with such intensity that i'm sure my ankles would swell in the meantime i implore you all to go on ebay or amazon and cough up the ten bucks or whatever for the old big box tape it really is a remarkable staple of ambitious trash cinema
