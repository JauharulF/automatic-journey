<START> the worst movie i've ever seen and i've seen allot acting is horrible plot is awful idea is terrible and no research was done what's so ever ok i admit air was a pretty good movie but not soccer dog' this dog is smaller than my cat how can he possibly play soccer even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half it's horrible don't watch this movie
<START> by today's standards the di might seem a little hokey lee version is more accurate i graduated boot camp in parris island sc in 1964 jim moore is as close to the real thing as you could put on the screen in 1957 i can't comment on the plot but i thought the ending was unrealistic for pvt owens is like many who found himself in a lot more difficult situation than he bargained for like so many he joined the marine corps for all the wrong reasons my drill were more like hartman than jim moore a lot more the di is more korean era and full metal jacket is more viet nam era today's movies allow that sort of thing on the screen i have the di in my collection i only recently found it on dvd
<START> the opportunity it gave me to look at ireland's past was invaluable br br i had the benefit of seeing this with my mother who hailed from cork and in watching we talked and i learned a lot from her about how things were back then br br stuff like how deasy and co was a cork soft drinks company how rain truly could destroy a harvest how farmers used to have to collect the crop how in dance halls the women and men did really have to stand along opposite walls before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance about the bellows that kept the fire going how priests really did call out the list of church and their donations and a bit about the currency back then which my dad helped by showing me a case displaying the pence shillings and that were used back then which were legal tender in england also br br i didn't pay that much attention to how good the movie was but i was very grateful in having this opportunity to look back on a period of time that for some is irish history but for others including some of our parents and grandparents is just their childhood
<START> what is there to say about this movie this movie is simply gorgeous a true feast for the eyes in the same way that the game set the standard for 3d role playing games 7 years ago this movie sets the standard for future cg movies many of you have seen the trailers and the amazing details in every frame and let me tell you this movie does not disappoint you can actually see the fibers in cloud's sweater vest br br the music is also very good the movie contains several rearranged tracks from the video game that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate br br the movie's main weakness is its story its not exactly a bad story but this story is exclusively aimed for people who have played the video game first time viewers may feel lost at times or they may not notice the significance of certain events br br i recommend this movie to everyone even if you've never played the game because what we have here is a special movie watch it and enjoy the the beautiful show
<START> well they sent it on tv between midnight and 2 00 am it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards br br no it was not really living up to my expectations i think the dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to what's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood making music out but then again this concept requires some interesting action between the characters br br i cannot say that i know king lear the shakespeare version very well if i had known the play i would probably have been able to predict much of the film br br well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display and we certainly see some bad sides oh yes the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animal br br if you then compare it with for italian for beginners or sang last song you see the same but opposite thing a crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way and if you dare do you may win br br when the film had ended i thought to myself oh that's why i haven't seen it before the film has its own beauty the quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good but the script could need something more a plot maybe wouldn't hurt
<START> one night at wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy it pushes its quirky characters and outrageous situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime the premise is about a gold digging woman named jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder so she can have all the worldly she so desperately desires you know this wouldn't be a bad strategy if she chased after rich guys this film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and andrew dice clay please that major flaw in jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker and that's unintentional watching it it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere one night at just could not decide what direction it wanted to take so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead it tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian there is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the played by matt dillon about how the sex is with jewel it seems like matt doesn't know neither do the viewers why was he dating her anyway one night at also wants to be funny sorry bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on three's company what's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy kind of like a sophomoric coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety nor could its lackluster sledgehammer in any shocks what the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way
<START> this movie is terrible a true hockey fan would have to assume that the people that appeared in and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game i got this hoping that it would be a guy movie but the only people that would probably enjoy this movie are females between the ages of 13 17 the hockey scenes are terrible playing like they're 5 years old diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc it's so difficult to predict the end of this movie though for those who have seen it who would have guessed for those that haven't seen it don't waste your time br br i figured it out less than halfway through the movie to call this movie a drama is ridiculous
<START> and normally i don't like surprises watch this movie by chance in a motel in south africa second week of a three month holiday in za apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously just watched the million dollar baby and had to look up hillary swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb didn't realise she was the solicitor in the red dust well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of clint before now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write ok here it goes i think if you are from a western country especially europe watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there so this hopefully will fill ten lines
<START> i really tried to like saw the story was good and i admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot however there were too many clichÃ©s and elements that while they may have looked cool they really made no sense br br first what i liked about the film was the overall tone of the story and i thought the premise was fantastic the character of the jigsaw killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage dario argento danny glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective and monica potter was good in a thankless role as a doctor's abducted wife smith's scene was incredible and both wan and should be commended for using that scene as a demo to get the backing for the film the whole notion that the jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill themselves is an excellent notion but once the film got going logic began to get away br br once they showed that zap was the one holding dr gordon's wife and daughter hostage it was apparent that he was not the jigsaw killer and part of it the scene where he puts a stethoscope over the heart of the terrified diana while allison screams at him through her gag was one of the most gratuitous scenes i've ever seen it was supposed to be chilling but establishing nothing also since the jigsaw killer finds a way for victims to kill themselves he has no problem slicing the throat of a police officer i guess it's a way to show that he doesn't want to get caught and will go to any means necessary to ensure that doesn't happen but to me it just didn't make any logic especially when he shows no remorse over the death of another detective which i did like that setup just would've been better if given to someone who actually deserved it br br i felt leigh was fine as adam it wasn't really a showy role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor however i wasn't too fond of james wan's direction the story may have been original but the direction sure wasn't i guess i'm tired of quick mtv style cuts in favor of the old approach to directing but a lot of scenes involving the jigsaw killer reminded me too much of se7en way too much of it as the film progressed to me it was starting to become a series of demo reels like hey look what i can do instead of being intriguing it became very distracting but hey it worked he's now directing final destination 3 so he's on a path to a successful career and i think he will become a top notch horror director in years to come br br what really did it in for me was the ending like i said i knew that jigsaw wasn't zap and i liked how adam discovered the mini tape player after killing him it would've had a terrific ending except for one fatal flaw i felt they should've left it where you didn't know who the killer was the way it was done was only done for one reason boy are we clever uh no to me it just didn't make sense br br some of the better horror films are made for a reason where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story while saw started out very well it started to become undone by the filmmakers' insatiable need to be cool and detract from the winning story they had perhaps if they weren't too insistent on making the films themselves and relied on a more experienced horror director to helm it i think it would've been the horror classic that it undeservedly has been given over the past four months if this and cabin fever are the future of horror i'm very scared
<START> there is no way to put into words just how bad how shapeless and laughless these vice academy films really are you have to experience one for yourself for the third time in a row writer director rick sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or directing talent there is nothing here that a person above the age of 5 will believe or laugh at yet the very brief nudity and other plot elements make the films unsuitable for kids which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental capabilities of 5 year olds elizabeth makes a more than welcome replacement for linnea quigley she is winningly bubbly and cute and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer smile as well but watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure
<START> i loved this movie so much i'm a big fan of amanda recently ended show i admire her besides her body for her acting capability she is a good actress br br the movie was great its about a girl named viola who wants to play soccer but when her school cuts the girls soccer team she gets upset her brother is set to go to a prestigious school and he decides to leave to england so viola wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the boarding school she goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team she gets in meanwhile she meets duke who is a sensitive guy who plays on the soccer team he really likes olivia laura ramsey who likes sebastian who is really viola sebastian is dating monique and suspects that sebastian isn't being himself br br this is certainly not a chick flick and i enjoyed it a lot its so funny and lovable i don't think i have seen amanda act better
<START> when i stepped into the theater i thought this was going to be a great movie and i was not disappointed one bit wow this movie is brilliant the emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary great acting by and beautiful music by a r rahman this might most probably be the best tamil movie i've seen in ages mani has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies br br this movie is basically about a young girl p s who is in search of her biological mother nandita das who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband j d a young novelist finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her he and his wife decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother br br this movie really screams excellent the way mani presented the movie is magnificent br br my rating 10 10
<START> my wife and i watched this marvelous movie this evening because we will watch russian dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before the second br br we both loved the apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives now in st russia we both identified slightly with the rough framework of the story because we were students florence italy for us so the script was not completely foreign to our early lives our living was considerably different but as with this movie anytime you throw together young people passing through the same life hoops as any developed world people they will experience much the same life situations br br the collection of people and the personal difficulties that they faced were and therein lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that i will see tomorrow as i wrote the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile this must be one of the film's great strengths allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and yet remain aloof the viewer can through that distance chuckle to themselves thinking i wouldn't have done something that dumb or i would have avoided that trap maybe that's why we go to movies
<START> this was one of the worst films i have ever seen i'm still trying to get over how bad it was just because it has godard's name attached to it doesn't make it great beyond the fact it makes absolutely no sense we see one insanely long shot of a traffic jam that is not stunning unbelievable or anything of the sort while this long shot of the traffic jam is going on you will be feeling probably more like making a sandwich than continuing watching it pieces of a supposed story silly stupid characters what message are we suppose to take from this it offers nothing and serves no purpose the arrogance of the director in showcasing these puny dull chain smoking french people and having them sit around and converse for hours on end and then getting it passed off as art is truly astounding
<START> how do stories this bad get made that's not a question it is a statement br br here are my problems with the film br br 1 much of the story development was predictable and boring my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout there wasn't really much to draw the viewer into the film br br 2 the characters were decidedly uncharismatic one was a loon another was confusing and the third was pretty damned boring there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people even though i knew it wouldn't happen i kept hoping that they would run into someone else someone more interesting br br 3 the physical environment was uncomfortable for me a trailer in the desert the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit how is it that these three people end up in the desert br br 4 and in the same desert did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desert br br 5 was it really necessary for ms ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit hey she looks great but it was pretty gratuitous br br okay so if i thought it was so bad why did i give it a 3 i am trying to be as objective as possible even though i found alan annoying i have to say that david did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles jeri ryan tried to do something with sarah but it just wasn't written very well okay so she was supposed to be a confused dysfunctional woman but why what did it add to the story her mood swings left me feeling like i was being jerked hard one way and then another and then another br br i don't often walk out on films but this one had me contemplating it several times stiff predictable boring proceed at your own risk br br my 2 cents
