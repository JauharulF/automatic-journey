<START> horrendous i'm a teenager and i don't mind teen movies but this is horrible aaron carter plays this popstar named jd mcqueen and to keep his grades up or something he works together with the 'nerd' jane but the girls' are too predictable and such the clothing most of the girls wear in the movie isn't realistic how would any of those girls get away with wearing no bra tube tops and shirts that expose the belly in high school at my school we'd be sent home for something like that br br and one part of the movie where jd texts jane she says tight he must think i'm an idiot i didn't know was so stressful ' how is stressful and how obsessed jane is with jd and how he 'falls' in love with her is very stupid the dialogue is cheesy and stupid the acting's terrible the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little to none br br for boppers who still love aaron carter you'll enjoy it if you're a casual watcher like me this is not the movie for you
<START> my mom brought me this movie on a dvd a guy in a rental recommended it but in fact this might be the worst movie i've ever seen you know i didn't expect much from this film but it didn't have a good story it wasn't even funny and it was senseless i was looking forward to see christine lakin in this movie because i loved step by step even she was a huge disappointment the story was completely unreal one of the party guys is dead he wasn't dead in fact he woke up later the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything but then there comes a homosexual policeman there is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes come on just be realistic at least waste of money really
<START> his significant charisma and commanding presence are about all that keep this afloat but fred williamson has done far better urban action films including many of his later vid released fare the big studios' williamson films of the early to mid 70's rarely had the punch of their mid level counterparts and this is a prime example clumsy action little violence and the pg rating is nowhere near questionable worth a look for hammer completists in any case
<START> pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality and yet i more than imagine hector owes some of his film making chops with this film to vittorio de sica's neo realist style in particular that film as with pixote takes place mostly inside a children's prison and yet while i might still prefer de sica's film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is no pun intended like choosing between two children they're both marvelous works of raw drama and with pixote has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions brought on after a world war this is how it was in brazil one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in city of god perhaps in some of the same locations and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made some aren't alive some 20 years later for all anyone knows br br the star pre teen street kid fernando ramos da silva plays the title character a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys the conditions couldn't be much worse and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty there's a riot and an escape and halfway through the film we find pixote with a few other youths including a practical transvestite not even 18 and they become pickpockets drug dealers whatever to get by none of this i should repeat is shown with a kind of ham fisted earnestness certainly you would never in a million years see ron howard or paul haggis direct this kind of picture and yet there's an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is trivialized br br nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for pixote and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older though not by much at all and become things that will haunt this person forever despite usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot nothing feels forced as with de sica maybe more so given the consistent conditions of san paolo and rio street kids he's a natural director of children and out of ramos da silva and jorge and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of cinematic drama that is not so real that it becomes documentary which isn't a bad thing per say and even subtlety in some scenes br br pixote may not be as well known as it's later 21st century brazilian films that look back on the horrors of rio or even neo realist films but it should be anyone wanting to get a good hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and soak in what is the best foreign film of 1981
<START> you know i only watched 15 minutes of this film so i can't really describe how great it is i mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director you just can't miss i mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet this film comes on you watch it and are shocked it is so brilliant so original it is so great it will feel to you that half an hour later you've turned off the screen but as you go to your bed you see it's only 15 minutes after midnight enjoy br br 3 out of 10
<START> once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled 'an american werewolf in london ' sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again 'an american werewolf in paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scott's performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scott's deceased friends who's soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends guys see ya ' what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scott's mysterious european love interest basically she's a french girl playing the french girl it isn't much of a stretch but all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles it's still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs lair here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film i don't care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped 'american werewolf in london ' as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time guys see ya ' terrible 3 out of a possible 10 t h
<START> whatever committee of pc enforcers is responsible for this movie has achieved something that i never thought possible to take some truly gifted actors davis hardin and taylor and make you want to insure you never encounter them in an enclosed space ever the sentiments that underlie the screenplay are so and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what audience would find this picture appealing much less funny architecture students perhaps br br only one scene is visually clever marcia gay hardin all and rhythm into a bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the whole of the rest of the film added up and multiplied to the tenth power as for the other members of the cast they probably won't want to put this one on their resumes
<START> the animal eating geek scenes were not as bad as you would think after having watched mondo cane and mondo magic these scenes are average the grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse but they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me br br otherwise the film was just sort of interesting i always like hearing the silly voice overs they never sound like what you think the actor actress would sound like in real life i liked the bright colors worn by the princesses the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too the youngest princess looked really young almost 14 or something the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes so that was good br br 3 10
<START> thank god i was not operating any heavy machinery it could have been an even worst disaster shots were slow very repetitive different scenes same shots medium shot medium shot medium shot snooze story line was rather empty william hurt was the worst where did he get that stupid accent from random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much there were more shots of traveling in her car than anything else the direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option great sedative if you can't sleep there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back
<START> a large bed possessed by a demon eats people among other things i'm not making this up br br completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to dvd in 2003 death bed the bed that eats is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe you most likely know of it thanks to patton excellent bit about it as well as stephen throwers essential book nightmare usa while watching it you wonder the following br br who is george berry and what drugs did he smoke inject snort before writing and directing this movie br br is this a horror comedy a combination of a horror flick and an art movie a weird prank being pulled on the audience br br what the hell am i watching br br death bed really defies any explanation i know that term is overused but it couldn't be truer than it is here this truly beggars description it is a horror comedy as well as art film horror hybrid but the whole thing is so surreal it must be seen the score sounds like the electronic bits from an old album the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything the direction is surprisingly competent and the movie at times feels like a jesus franco movie that is if his movies were intentionally funny br br in the end there really is no proper way to describe this movie lord knows i've tried but really few movies are as odd unique or mind boggling as this is see it but you've been warned this is also the only movie george berry has ever done he definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this i'll tell you that much
<START> the remarkable sometimes infuriating often brilliant films of john cassavetes occupy a unique position in american low budget partly improvised inspired by cinÃ©ma veritÃ© documentary and related to underground film they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly appreciative audienceÂ br br after drama studies the young cassavetes quickly made his name as an unusually unrefined intense actor often appearing in films about disaffected rebellious youth such as crime in the streets and edge of the city br br setting up an actors' workshop he worked to transform an improvisational experiment into his feature the result shadows taking three years to complete and partly financed by his performances in tv's johnny staccato was a breakthrough in american about the effect of racism on an already fraught relationship between two black men and their sister two of whom pass for white the film is impressive for its irregular seemingly formless style and naturalistic plot was minimal mood and emotional apparent truth were everythingÂ
<START> western union is something of a forgotten classic western perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its on dvd in the united states however all is not lost as it has now appeared on region 2 in england this being a blessing in some ways is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union telegraph company is without a region 1 release it beggars belief it simply doesn't make sense br br produced by fox in 1941 western union was directed by fritz lang this was only the second occasion the great german director undertook to direct a western he had done an excellent job the year before with fox's the return of frank james and would have only one more western outing in 1952 with the splendid notorious lang was no ford or hawks but with western union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward it boasted a good cast headed by robert young randolph scott and dean jagger the female lead is taken by virginia gilmore who really has little to do in the picture an actress who never made anything of her career her presence here is merely cosmetic br br it is curious that robert young has top billing over scott it is clearly scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains young doesn't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western he just looks plain silly going up against barton in a gunfight an actor who never really distinguished himself except perhaps with crossfire 1947 young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tv's marcus md in the seventies he died in 1998 at the age of 91 br br western union recounts the connection by telegraph wire of omaha and salt lake city scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from marauding sioux and to also take on and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with scott for the affections of miss gilmore some comic relief is provided by and irritatingly so some would say by slim summerville and john carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor br br altogether though a spanking good western albeit on region 2 but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with my only crib is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics ugh br br footnote interestingly the associate producer on western union was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a partnership that would produce some of scott's finest westerns in the fifties
<START> the vicious circle is a very unknown british mystery story like many hitchcock movies it's about a man who is being accused of a crime he didn't commit and does everything he can to prove it this time it's a dr john mills who finds a murdered german actress from his floor as an honest man the doctor calls scotland yard which turns out to be a big mistake br br there's really nothing special in this little movie still watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time i enjoyed following the plot development fine actors are a plus
<START> crimes of passion is a film that is disappointing on most counts where should i start from the plot it is despairingly simplistic and full of gaps the direction reminds a cheap b movie the acting john laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as well intentioned husband of a frozen wife bobby annie pots is unconvincing as frozen wife amy and it is only kathleen turner above average and antony perkins excellent which get passable acting marks more specifically antony perkins gives a great performance as the pervert reverend peter shayne while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and frail joanna crane satisfactorily br br unfortunately the performances of turner and perkins alone are insufficient to help get the film a grade higher than 4 10 watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competition basic instinct for example otherwise avoid
<START> i remember when this nbc mini series aired when i was in high school after reading the novel i thought i'd check out some adaptations didn't expect much out of a tv mini series but now i might have to check out some more this is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made writer simon moore who wrote the teleplay for the original traffic mini series upon which the soderberg film was based came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly he frames gulliver's adventures as flashbacks with the actual story beginning as gulliver first returns home everything having happened on one journey gulliver played by ted danson is sort of crazy seeming when his wife mary steenburgen welcomes him back into his home unfortunately the house is now owned by the local doctor james fox who has designs on steenburgen gulliver seems merely disturbed at first but when he starts telling stories of tiny people that's all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum all four of gulliver's travels are related in this version in the same order as the novel the only time this has been done on film i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks gulliver's small son whom he has never met before reminds him of the the doctors who observe him in his cell from a loom above him and remind him of the and the scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the and the professors at the academy finally when he is put on trial he is reminded of the and the yahoos the cast of this thing is amazing and includes peter o'toole ned beatty alfre woodard john gielgud kristin scott thomas omar sharif and warwick davis the biggest flaw of the mini series is that the acting is really uneven you have all these fine actors but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of l a law but don't do well in a costume drama ted danson isn't especially great although he has a few sequences where he excels it's probably better that he didn't attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent steenburgen is actually pretty good at it and is quite good overall another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly it's not believable that gulliver spent eight years away from home as is claimed but in general it captures swift's tone and purpose very well while with its structure adding a new emotional level
