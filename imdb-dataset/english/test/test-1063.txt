<START> what a great little film lots of good roles from some random stars basically there are these pot growers that get caught up in a comical adventure at points the film makes you believe everyone is going to end up dead which adds to the comedy when the character of john lithgow 3rd rock re appears its impossible not to imagine the trip this may have caused like a total paradox the film is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end billy bob thornton astronaut farmer is brilliant in fact looking back the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot growers together everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up br br as i the final scene is a dream however a nightmare at the same time i love it when hank azaria carter says at the end do you think we should do this every year i felt my self wishing they would br br i'm not going to say this film is good for everyone but as a lover of stoner movies i give it 10 10 my advice have a joint ready kick back and enjoy
<START> see three colors blue and three colors white they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors red red is a fantastic film it can be enjoyed in a single viewing and indeed the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing but watch it again once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie you will see new things with each viewing with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind with each additional viewing you find yourself discovering that it is in fact a work of genius red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the french flag the story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect the facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer if you are used to the blatant symbolism in most mass films you may find red a bit slow you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom and yawning wonder what all the excitement is about this is not a mindless vicarious experience everything is not explained to you you must think as you watch you must see not simply look wonderful movie one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer
<START> there is no real story the film seems more like a fly on the wall drama documentary than a proper film so this piece may in itself be a spoiler teen drama about 3 young singaporean kids very similar to uk who play truant from school run with gangs get into fights insult people on the street get tattoos hang about doing nothing etc etc they generally imagine themselves to be hard and every so often shout challenging rap chants into the camera filmed in mtv style fast cuts crazy camera angles tight close ups and animation interludes the dialogue might have been crisper in the original languages of mandarin and than in the subtitles and i have no doubt that some of the contemporary singapore references will slip over western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless of course you are familiar with singapore this kind of teen film may be a first for singapore but it has been done before and done better in other western countries la haine 1995 for example
<START> angels demons br br the movie is directed by ron howard he has had also made famous movies like the da vinci code cinderella men he directed also the famous tv series 24 the most famous actors are tom hanks the da vinci code the green mile forrest gump Â ewan mcgregor cassandra's dream moulin rouge star wars the phantom menace Â br br in the begin i was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big because they changed the father of in someone else silvano bentivoglio argenziano another change is that robert langdon tom hanks never goes to the it was nice that they could film on location in the br br then movie goes on they are spectacular car races in rome an i also like the part in archives very much when they destroy the work of galileo it was funny it was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in robert langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out the electricity get br br i found it very stupid that robert langdon not went in the helicopter but that the ewan mcgregor gets in alone another detail is that in the movie the is an adopted son from the pope in the book he is the real son of the pope br br when i should give the best acting performance then i should say who plays inspector the worst acting was from the assassin who was played by nikolaj lie i think he was underachieving because in adams apples he played br br i think the whole movie is underachieving because director ron howard made some many stupid changes i would rate the movie by 4 10
<START> no matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original if it existed on it's own it would be a 2 3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4 5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards if the film was a re working or as in planet of the apes a re imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right only referencing the original imagine it this way if someone took the model in the posed her in a different way and painted her you could only compare the framing concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally br br that said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made the shower scene will never be forgotten the remake was meant to be a celebration of hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work br br the degrading aspects of this picture were vince vaughn and anne heche it's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between norman and marion in the original was really quite innocent norman didn't really understand sex he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her this makes norman sympathetic and almost an anti hero you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'mother' in the remake that whole dynamic is gone i must admit to janet leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that anne heche is really unattractive and so norman finding 'her' marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to vince vaughn's norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like who you feel absolutely no sympathy for they further destroy norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room it destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for it's like re making 'it's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp totally degrading br br the only other character that i had problems with was rita wilson as caroline marion's workmate in the original when pat hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself when rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with anne heche over her br br i'll admit that i am very biased the original 'psycho' is my favorite film of all time had the film been a reworking with a different angle then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable br br hitch famously the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it this also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour n b before people think 'he can't remember i'm from england and we spell it colour br br a remake should be just that re made this is a forgery a complete copy and a very bad one at that i could go on comparing but there is no point almost everything is superior in the original the only one thing that is better is the performance of viggo mortensen as sam loomis john gavin was very flat in the original hitch called him 'the behind his back and mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance william h macy and julianne moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals br br overall a movie that should be labeled embarrassing failed experiment only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you but view original too' the movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0 5 out of 5 for macy moore and mortensen
<START> in the beginning with the careful remote location and metal sound i thought of the opening scene in once upon a time in the west when it gets to the city then it begins to feels like kitchen stories or drifting clouds even possibly grimm br br then it turns out that this is more similar to joe versus the volcano in theme not style and the movie executes from beginning to end the same understated style letting you observe take in the steel blue grayish tone of the suites dresses wall color furniture bedsheets mirrors cars music background sounds and even people's expression then near the end there is one shot of a completely different tone warm yellow with soft music and ocean splashing children and laughter br br but maybe the observation is too long for me i would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot still beautifully done
<START> i thought this was a really cute movie inspiring makes me want to try acting i love kelly ripa and it's nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children i've already watched it 3 times of course i also loved seeing joe barbara especially since another world went off the air
<START> martino a young teacher in the island of elba has been formed by maestro an excellent educator to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks something that gets him in trouble at the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals the island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in european history of the 19th century napoleon is coming to his exile not exactly a high point in his life br br with surprise martino is chosen to accompany napoleon who is writing his memoirs and is in need of help for his own project the young man comes from a sea merchant family his brother and sister want him to go on an commercial expedition but martino has decided his place belongs in elba because he will try to assassinate napoleon little deters him after his mentor is tried for treason and condemned to be shot by a firing squad br br martino finds his consolation with the much older baroness emilia a beautiful woman in his own interaction with the deposed emperor a different kind of man emerges napoleon is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of martino not suspecting with the plans the young man's own plans for him unfortunately martino is not able to put his design into action because napoleon has other plans in mind br br paolo the director of caterina va in citta shows why his early promise is still there mr also collaborated with the screenplay which is based on a novel by ernesto the director shows he is as good in intimate drama as well as with this type of spectacle alessandro pesci the cinematographer does an excellent job with the images he was able to get br br elio a young italian actor is the best thing in the movie he is playing against more experienced players yet he manages to convince us he is the idealist youth trying to get justice to what he perceives is a noble cause the great daniel auteuil is a more subdued napoleon than one would expect from anyone's interpretation of this larger than life man monica is the love interest of martino but she has little to do plays
<START> imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew they've cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads if your imagination can't stretch that far just watch the glimmer man as it's the next worse thing br br mild spoilers br br jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by steven seagal since he's also someone a hidden past but don't tell anyone because it's top secret perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the glimmer man continues in the vein of all of seagal's other movies in that it's utter utter crap look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office love beads man in you're in the wrong office steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage br br don't make me kill you br br is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman i'm just thinking that in another movie where steven isn't the hero ie a good movie the cop would say something along the lines of don't kill me i've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home so anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows it goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at home br br as the story progresses steven i've given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop as he inspects the bodies oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star
<START> i should have realized that any two video set being sold for only 6 would be bad i even read the reviews before watching this film and that still didn't sway me i loved the book and i knew it couldn't be as bad as people said br br yeah it is br br a patchwork of film video and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three hour tour of one chapter of james a michener's epic novel well the time period covered was one chapter but i don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book the packaging on my copy of the movie gives maria conchita alonso top billing though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene on the second tape br br the actors are to be commended for playing their roles well despite a smarmy overwrought script they are to be insulted though for accepting the roles in the first place
<START> this certainly isn't a comedy i don't know what it was marketed that way as a serious movie it lacks any sort of substance unless you're fresh out of sunday school or needing your noah fix you'll find yourself bored to tears br br the supporting cast took away from what little of the movie was left lauren graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth his children don't really add anything to the movie they seem to be around solely to brood about their absent father at the beginning jonah hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesn't come off as humorous br br i found the original to be a decent movie disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere
<START> it's really good to see van damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c grade flops derailed and second in command which were both tragic and not in a good way the sheperd border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action fight sequences it's good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film until death had no martial arts in it at all br br that being said this film is significantly inferior to until death which was a really good turn for van damme until death lacked the over the top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film still the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line you may want to skip this one br br i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on the only real problem i have with this film is the title the shepherd i don't get it i suppose border patrol just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word shepherd in front of it br br my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by van damme movie standards not in any other film category br br i e it's good for a van damme film
<START> with a title like that you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter goya then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic inquisition with even more latitude perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period with lurid characterisation too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact milos forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic rambling mish mash that fails on all three accounts br br milos forman who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps is the great director who painted the artist mozart as a buffoon and got away with it won awards for it in fact his life in czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse repellent regimes especially communism he also made the equally over the top but rather impressive one flew over the cuckoo's nest so at the age of 74 how does he come to offer us this mess in ghosts goya is one step removed from buffoon the main character is brother lorenzo passionately acted by javier bardem natalie portman is equally vibrant as model and later in the film her own daughter the tenuous connection with goya is that he happens to paint both of them br br lorenzo tortures and then rapes who he suspects of being a jew her father tortures lorenzo napoleon dashes in to liberate spain briefly gets out of the dungeon the church has left her in and searches for her child goya is still painting but has gone deaf his main preoccupation seems to be helping and so on br br historically goya was also a historian as forman had sadly the idea of a biopic of goya the painter this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together Â a large slice of history as seen by goya but the painter is too tangential to receive any weight similarly a document of the terrors of the inquisition should be done Â compared to other despotic orders throughout time the holy see has been forgiven with barely a confession though one might ask if forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything br br i thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story he says in the production notes there were a great many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the spanish inquisition but the story is too tenuous to hold our attention against our expectations and with a background of something major the life of a great painter the horrors of the inquisition and even the french revolution we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted if kind infatuation of the result is that we feel cheated br br background detail is appallingly handled goya went deaf in when the film starts not 15 years later napoleon is as believable as a cut out from a cereal packet we see the church passing out a death sentence when the normal procedure was for the church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work battles look overly choreographed and stagey a peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it br br on the positive side the production values are mostly good the colours are vivid the pacing excellent at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline bardem is excellent and portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman while it doesn't say very much about goya what it does say is nice even if superficial and pretty irrelevant br br i once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and i asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life who would it be on his record forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list
<START> i love movies in this genre beautiful girls toilet humor gratuitous nudity so why didn't i like this movie no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot who's who where is the money it's not se7en just make me laugh maybe it's me but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon's movies this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling waiting for what's next instead i find myself stopping to think why did they keep that scene i do not recommend this movie if you are expecting van wilder think again the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids 2 10 generously
<START> if you're a fan of jackass viva la bam or the videos then you already know what you're in for but this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original and man does this movie pack a mean low blow but i mean that in a good way it's the same type of death defying gut wrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from bam knoxville and co but this time with even more laughs than ever before with johnny insane tolerance for pain bam love for harassing his friends family and steve gross out factor you have one hell of a funny film the bar for the stunts skits and general mayhem of the jackass crew has been raised jackass 3 doubtful because it's nearly impossible to improve on perfection
