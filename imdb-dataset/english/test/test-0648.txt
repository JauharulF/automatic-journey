<START> i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn't wait br br let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all together great show
<START> henry don ameche turns up at the entrance to hell and recounts his life story to his excellency laird cregar the story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life and in particular his relationship with martha gene tierney at the end of the film we cut back to henry and his excellency for a very predictable ending br br unfortunately there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens its a sentimental story of one man's life and its very boring i watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish despite the lubitsch touch i yawned more than 15 times hugo charles coburn is good whenever he is on screen as the grandfather and there were a few funny moments of dialogue the colour made it a good spectacle but it wasn't enough to save this from going into the reject pile in the same mould as its a wonderful world and you can't take it with you and so not surprisingly it was nominated for an oscar a story about ordinary people none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest boring sentimental and the biggest damp squib of an ending that i can remember
<START> not too much the classic top gun or independence day when it comes to fighter jet excitement yes the movie top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how anyone can pull off a rescue but it is cool because it breaks all traditional rules the kid doing what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants to do it br br i can't really put my finger on just what i love about this movie but others i know that saw the movie feel the same way about it i do i think its just basically a lot of fun but maybe a little too unrealistic for some to buy into br br again regardless i loved it people who i know saw it loved it so its definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it put it this way i thought that top gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies ever and i like this movie just as much if not more than top gun don't miss out do see it a truly inspirational movie
<START> the second not animated movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the roman empire is even more hilarious than the first film asterix contre ceasar br br where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their identity this sequel which is a separate story as are all the comic books is even better sure all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic books are present again is still dying to taste the magic potion that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers caesar and the rest of the roman empire are still enemy number 1 but some new refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well br br not only is setting very idyllic biggest part plays of course in egypt but rather than repeating movie number one some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies bruce lee etc this is all not very new but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comic book with almost the same title as the movie and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with asterix really works br br in that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comic writers and who didn't hesitate to bring laurel and hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to kirk douglas br br if all of this doesn't convince you to watch this movie i'm sure monica bellucci playing cleopatra will
<START> these days writers directors and producers are relying more and more on the surprise ending the old art of bringing a movie to closure taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending has been lost now what we have is a movie that no matter how complex detailed or frivolous can be wrapped up in 5 minutes it was all in his her head that explanation is the director's safety net if all else fails or if the writing wasn't that good or if we ran out of money to complete the movie we can always say it was all in his her head and end the movie that way the audience will buy it because well none of us are psychologists and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia not that we know about so we take the story and believe it after all the mind is a powerful thing some movies have pulled it off but those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings every director writer now thinks they can pull it off because well fight club did it and it made a lot of money so we get movies like the machinist secret window identity and this movie just to name a few
<START> this film has the language the style and the attitude down plus greats rides from a world champ and the great jerry lopez john philbin as turtle has the surf pidgin down and the surfing scenes are still the best ever a true classic that can be seen many times peeples is a babe and laird hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world's number one extreme surfer
<START> a sentimental heart tugging family film set in england of the 1920s a young elizabeth taylor wins a horse in a and decides to enter him in the grand national fortunately ex jockey mickey rooney is around to give liz some help director clarence brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands he and screenwriters helen deutsch and theodore reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally true there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced but overall it's quite affecting and gorgeously filmed in technicolor the race itself is quite thrilling and like so many great classics there's a marvelous three hankie fade out at the end liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start and rooney who i usually find rather annoying is surprisingly subdued and really very good donald crisp is as liz's gruff father and angela lansbury is a delight as her older boy crazy sister most of the acting kudos however belong to anne revere who won a richly deserved supporting actress oscar playing liz's wise and caring mother
<START> one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an in name sequel there's nothing wrong with that except this the return of chevy chase as ty webb this connects the viewer to this character from the original caddyshack in 1980 and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first one br br there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return he carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top jackie mason is the new' rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are way different dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one robert stack airplane was good in the new' ted knight villian role we miss you ted danny noonan should have been back so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later should not have undergone the total makeover it did instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one when you watch this film keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy fans of the first should see it but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart
<START> one of the many speculations about y2k was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on december 31 1999 in the book of life ' writer director hal hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium armageddon beginning with the return of jesus to earth on new year's eve the story examines the task of the son of god who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the book of life now contained in a mac laptop computer in which there is also the names of the one hundred and forty four thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day jesus martin donovan along with p j harvey arrives in new york city to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his father's will but he begins to have second thoughts must he judge the living and the dead do they deserve what must befall them it is a cup he would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment which gives encouragement to satan thomas jay ryan who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams an artistically rendered high concept film hartley presents the story in an intelligent thought provoking manner taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist the dialogue between jesus and satan is intriguing and stimulating as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city it's an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the revelations of st john in the apocalypse the last book of the new testament and there is logic in hartley's approach to the second coming he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality christ wears a suit and tie effectively blending in with the populace while satan's attire is a bit more casual his appearance somewhat scruffy he sports a bruise above his left eye donovan is well cast as jesus lending a benevolent and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective it is of course a unique portrayal of the saviour and possibly the best since max von sydow's in the greatest story ever told ' he successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility of serenity that is the essence at the very core of the character and ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the prince of darkness he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch his eyes are darkly penetrating a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares he's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you it's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with portrayal of jesus the supporting cast includes martin martyr edie dave dave d j mendel lawyer james urbaniak true believer lawyer's assistant and anna kohler hotel clerk in his own inimitable style with the book of life ' hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting entertaining and truly unique he has a way of capturing life as it is just off center a method which works especially well with a film like this comparatively short for a feature film running time of 63 minutes it nevertheless is one of hartley's best and more than worth the price of admission it's a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later and that is part of the attraction of this film it makes you realize that later' most likely is now i rate this one 9 10
<START> i watch family affairs coronation st east enders on uktv every week night family affairs is by far the worst bad plots bad sequences and the worst acting of any even worse than the americans and that is saying something br br i find it very frustrating that all these shows on uktv australia are so far behind the uk and when one trys to find out the reason for this they just fob you off with some story that they will show double episodes to catch up needless to say this never happens i am very happy that family affairs is going to make space for something of better quality but at the same time i would to know the background reasons did they finally realize how bad it was did people stop watching it whatever it was you musn't leave us in suspense why do you feel that you have to keep everything a secret from your fans or is it that you just don't care i feel strongly that you should try and keep your public up to date family affairs is notorious for just having its characters disappear and reappear for seemingly no reason we do get involved in the people and enjoy following their lives br br i can understand why family affairs would have to come to an end even though we are so far behind here in australia it is easy to see that the writers are running out of ideas for new plots so many plots are being repeated and old episodes coming back i have also noticed that as new characters are being introduced a lot of them are really bad actors like you are scraping the bottom of the barrel and ending up with the drek regards vince
<START> is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people as of now i haven't rewatched the movie and i don't think i will br br the story follows the experiences of a man max who is engaged to be married to muriel he remembers his old girlfriend lisa he considers this the love of his life as he listens by accident to lisa talking on the telephone thus he tries to find lisa here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa there are many layers to this movie there are undercurrents of jealousy and so on there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience the main character max has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect i don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice br br the character of alice is even worse her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers that is the point i guess the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life in the end she understands that she needs to get away from it all the ending lends a cynical touch because it seems as if max's love for alice is temporary and fake it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option i e muriel than to pursue something that is so fleeting i e lisa or alice in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance in a way br br the performances deserve high praise vincent cassel as max gives a great performance he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly but the real star of the movie is as alice her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max the scene where she screams i am a nutcase too really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her br br btw i also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie alice's actions can be explained in many ways and her unreasonable obsession with lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire it may be far fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time that may lead many to question her sexual orientation br br overall i would give it a 9 10 i think it deserves it but i subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor i think it is a perfect movie otherwise
<START> larry donner billy crystal has a crazy life his wife kate mulgrew stole his book and left him he has a new budding romance with a girl named beth kim greist he doesn't know how to start his book and his students of his screen writing class are stranger than most however one student danny devito is extra strange he lives with his evil momma anne ramsey and he can't get up the courage to kill her so than he goes to larry for help making his life go from normal crazy to extra crazy br br stu silver should have done more the dialog the characters the whole script is near perfect and danny devito has proved to me he's more than a great actor he's a great director his kid's movie matilda is among my favorite family movies and now this is one of my favorite comedies br br it's a black comedy most jokes are about murder but it's damn funny all of the actors are doing their full potential whether they're main characters billy crystal or just one bit minor characters olivia brown br br if you like comedy who doesn't than you'll like this 8 10 stars
<START> tamara anderson and her family are moving once again as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape fifteen years old she is in her rebellious stage already angry at her father for their frequent relocations her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis her mother's absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion the boy next door rusty as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house br br the story is modest to a fault it's oddly paced and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tension the actors portraying the parents are fine alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother and maria is particularly effective as the guilt ridden mother of the dead teenager but katie boland as tamara is too amateurish to carry the movie the dialog is very natural and boland can't quite pull it off she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward one can see her thinking this is what my line is and this is the face i'm supposed to rather than actually reacting to the other actors she's not the only one kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes br br if done right the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing
<START> the original airport 1970 was a classic of its kind and the first two b movie follow ups airport 1975 airport '77 were watchable fun at best amusing camp at worst but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience it's unendurable and not even good for laughs br br all of the three airport sequels were theatrical releases made by universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a tv movie of its day with cheapjack production grotesque casting visual ugliness and tasteless unfunny comedy the project was clearly doomed by the creative efforts of universal executive jennings lang who personally produced and is given a story credit br br everyone starts somewhere and writer eric roth forrest gump might have provided an element of self burlesque as had the previous films especially the notorious airport 1975 but there is nothing worth spoofing in roth's turgid incoherent script and even the comedy airplane left this crud untouched br br what makes the concorde airport '79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals the worst victim is the supremely gifted tyson the autobiography of miss jane pittman reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight br br a special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful george kennedy who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list the official mascot of the airport series and the only actor to appear in all four movies kennedy had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself and his lovable and heroic character of joe patroni unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and over the hill kennedy is and overage pretty boy alain delon relentlessly calls him porky pig as part of a buddy bonding that falls completely flat even kennedy's parisian romance the only humane part of this plane wreck turns out to be merely a set up for a hateful joke at kennedy's and the viewer's expense
<START> spoilers even though the movie they made me a criminal is nowhere as good as the later john garfield anti hero classics like body soul in 1947 force of evil in 1948 and his last and very underrated he ran all the way in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on may 21 1952 at the young age of 39 br br garfiled plays the part of light weight champion johnnie and later the fugitive from the law jack who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with even though he's been declared officially dead manager doc ward robert doc who during a drunken victory party killed reporter charles mcgee john ridgely who was going to expose to the public his fighter johnnie lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy doc smashed a bottle over mcgee's head killing him as was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite br br doc was later killed in a car crash with girlfriend goldie ann sheridan but doc burned to a crisp and with watch on him was mistaken for johnnie told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer robert strange who took 9 750 00 of the 10 000 00 of money that he had for this great piece of advice told johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on jack and get the hell out of the state of new york talking about sleazy shysters johnnie now jack travels the rails from new york down to arizona ending up at the date farm where most of the film takes place br br if it wasn't for john garfield in the lead role as both jack the movie would have long been lost and forgotten garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie even the transported dead end kids i guess we can call them the arizona kids here acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies all that due to being on the same stage or filming location with john garfield br br they made me a criminal is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair in the end jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl peggy gloria dickson to open up a gas station with it br br giving the european champ gaspar frank the fight of his life and getting 2 000 00 thats 500 00 a round for doing it jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the arizona kids that sometimes taking a punch is far and more courageous then throwing one the fact that jack could have easily clobbered but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police as on the loose killer johnnie but instead went as far as he could taking everything that could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together br br i for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story the cop morty claude rains who came to arizona from new york to arrest jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair we were told all this right at the start of the movie why knowing that jack johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again i can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies
