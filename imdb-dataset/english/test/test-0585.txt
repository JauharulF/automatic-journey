<START> is the story of a token black man on the board of directors of a large advertising firm who is accidentally voted chairman of the board when the owner of the firm keels over while trying to stutter out an idea that he was apparently quite excited about of course takes his new role to heart and fires most everyone in the agency hires a new crew all black except for a token white guy and proceeds to crank out the most offensive and non pc commercials one could ever ask for now it's a rather motley crew he has and despite that they somehow manage to be successful while raking in the cash i rather like the scene where potential advertisers are being relieved of bags of cash and then told to get out and their commercials will follow later like them or not the story is good but of course the highlight here is the nasty commercials themselves especially the one for face off acne cream this is rather dated but still a fun movie and full of hilarious moments robert downey sr was working for an ad agency doing experimental ads at the time and i guess this was his middle finger to madison avenue agencies very good and pretty damned funny 8 out of 10
<START> usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity its at the very least campy i e cybill shepherd as martha stewart lauren bacall as doris duke this is the most horrendous cheap and boring television movie ever made if vh 1 is going to make a television film they have got to spend a little more money on them flex alexander though gifted with the michael voice is not a great dancer does not resemble michael one bit and does not even have his mannerisms down vh 1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery he doesn't actually come out looking exactly the same why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her and don't even get me started on the woman as janet jackson terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep vh 1 from producing any more movies flex alexander would have made a much better jermaine jackson rather than michael costumes trashy ripoffs neverland spliced together footage from news docs don't bother with this one its not even remotely worth it the one good piece of casting the actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie presley though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl
<START> of course this came out right at the beginning of the 1980s of course it did those drama students dancing in the street to irene cara's famous theme song it's an indelible eighties leg warmer style image but there's more to the film than that there's deprivation and one man's struggle to learn to read and a struggle with sexuality and an attack on a child and one girl tricked into taking topless photographs and contemplation of suicide in the end though it is also about that song
<START> the reviewer in variety said this was overwritten and overlong and i kind of agree with it it has some events that seem forced and unlikely like when cal crudup once again as the 'lost vacant and kind of male and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place the story is one of those 1970's guy must find meaning in his life stories and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal the whole hitting the road to find meaning in life theme is still kind of interesting though does it all really lead back to family i wasn't so sure the acting is okay i particularly liked karen allen and james who unfortunately only have supporting roles i'd give it a
<START> absolutely fantastic whatever i say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves watch it now fantastic
<START> there are two things that i noticed in this film this is not a spoiler just a mistake in storytelling when cole takes bill to his first b e he finds the box as soon as cole finds it he says the box everyone's got a box a minute later just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says we're actually very fortunate you don't see these often br br observation 2 spoiler alert br br i had to watch the thing three times i couldn't figure a couple of things out then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time br br that was a good thing because i don't know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix br br color me obsessive
<START> being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick thouroughly i related to the character ann august more than most would my mother isnt as eccentric as adele but the feelings of lonliness is the same this movie is perfect in the aspects and natalie's and susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people i would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away because there is alot of people out there who would wish to be anywhere but here including me and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother its the tears that blend everyone around you together more
<START> this flick is a waste of time i expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting van damme's acting is awful he never was much of an actor but here it is worse he was definitely better in his earlier movies his screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners the whole dialog in the film is a disaster same as the plot the title the shepherd makes no sense why didn't they just call it border patrol the fighting scenes could have been better but either they weren't able to afford it or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas this is a cheap low type of action cinema
<START> as anthony said i wanted to stick my head in a bucket of pull my eyeballs out and jump off a cliff this summarizes my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort artless self indulgent thoughtless and just bad bad beyond comprehension what else can i say if you are unfortunate enough to be in an area where this piece of idiotic trash is playing please please have mercy on soul and avoid at all costs
<START> this movie was offensively pc predictable and clichÃ©d i couldn't imagine a movie that better exemplifies the myopic narcissistic preachiness of today's hollywood if you haven't seen this don't bother watching it if you have show some courage and tell people how awful it really is my wife a minority in her own right was offended by the inherent and racist message of the film this movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little if anything at all to add to any discussion about racism in this country instead it's the kind of cheap sensationalist crap that is promoted as deep and challenging thought what kind of a bubble do you have to live in to think that this is at all impressive
<START> another fabulous movie from catherine this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie using comedy Â a new genre for Â we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style the character who plays the director in the movie is based on the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film Âa ma as is the main teenage actress but the film like all of work is not entertainment alone it is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to as opposed to pornography that is a cornerstone of work and a devotion to real emotion we see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them hypnotising them into the parts they need to play bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them she makes meaningful movies not titillation but she shows the work that is needed to produce this and so gives us insights both into the decidedly french film making process and the psychology of male Â female sexuality
<START> i myself am a physics student and i have to say i think this is one of the best introductions to string theory that's out there the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string although it's actually m theory accessible to a wider audience br br some science' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation and presenting the theory in a boring stale style this programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale br br i suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes but the thing is that's against the point explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base and the way it's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining br br whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that greene presents extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life are they but if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today and if you're studying physics well it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more
<START> first of all i just have to say that i'm a huge lost fan everyone who makes the show i love 'em it's got everything in it really br br i'm glad that they have great people making it for instance jack bender is the greatest director well maybe after j j abrams and of course full credit to damon carlton they're geniuses br br anyway the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best episodes of lost ever live together die alone focuses on desmond david hume's story of getting to the island and henry ian is so great playing that character the makers of the show would have been very stupid if they would've let die on us br br so in lost the plane crash survivors have been there for 65 days 65 days man rousseau has been there for sixteen years and the others have been there for god knows how long referring to jeffrey lieber abrams anyway i hope we'll get the answers we need in season 3 can't wait my vote is nine
<START> this film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the top notch performances of 12 angry men i rented it on a whim and was amazed that i had not heard of it before br br i do not know if this was emilio directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye br br the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time br br there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between estevez and his ex girlfriend almost seem written for another film estevez comes off as another character all together but those are minor complaints br br this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences i rate it 8 out of a difficult 10 br br
<START> the gimmick as it were of this 1934 paramount comedy is the six comedy performers paired off into three man and woman teams who all appear together w c fields and his frequent screen partner appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a small town sheriff and innkeeper fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own one of a kind brand of misanthropic surreal comedy into his part and it works wonderfully especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilarious br br at first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of charlie and mary boland next to the broad jokey vaudeville patter of the great husband and wife comedy team of george burns and gracie allen but here it works perfectly because of the parts george and gracie are given in the script they are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to california on and honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step including brilliantly while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life br br making burns and allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their far out larger than life comedy characters into a real world setting the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a gold mine as gracie's famous naive delivery itself br br charlie deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker pinky he's marvelously subtle and underplayed and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard br br the script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor who can't get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more first rate comedy material from burns and allen br br for the pre code watchers out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as tries to get across to george just why he and his wife want to be alone for a while br br there are a few signs of a rushed production here the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with w c field's own short the golf specialist and the knot in field's tie is constantly changing in shape these don't bother me though and they shouldn't bother anybody who is enjoying the film br br six of a kind is a real little known gem and one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while if you're thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes
