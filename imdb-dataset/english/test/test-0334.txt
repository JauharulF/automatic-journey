<START> this movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions there was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie it wasn't in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads beside each one are two attractive women the men begin asking do you hear that or do you see them we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating the women do not see these creatures this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists what is this about we never find out the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do Â they blow up the lab but why what is the point we have no idea this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline sorry but this movie was a waste of 4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it take my advice don't rent it
<START> the true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known led the game of football out of the stone age with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts but he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches along the way he brought fame and glory to a tiny little unknown catholic school in indiana pat o'brien is incomparable in his role as terrific cast that includes ronald reagan who gives a great performance as notre first true superstar george br br for football aficionados this is the greatest football movie ever made do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version some versions have deleted scenes for some reason if you got the good version look for a brief cameo by the immortal jim as he sticks his head in the locker room telling and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins
<START> the focus of the key relationship in a young man's life that of his relationship with his father was excellently portrayed in this movie the greatest game ever played the movie captured the essence of how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream br br it didn't matter that economic and social class mores presented obstacles to be overcome by both father and son it also didn't matter that others were the son in exuberant celebration what mattered the most was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of approval the real life challenge for both father and son had been met br br considering that in real life the hero of the story kept his amateur status and became a businessman pretty much verifies that all that went before the match was the training ground for a valid father and son relationship
<START> thomas de helte is yet another road movie without the most important element of a film a good story the characters are not very original and not particularly interesting especially thomas bo larsen is a pain in the neck playing the same role he has played in the past few years and which he repeated in it seems as if he thinks acting being angry and screaming at other people the film doesn't make much too sense and isn't very funny either although it tries hard to be kooky and weird if you're going to make a road movie why not add something original to the genre
<START> sammi cheng andy lau are coupled yet again in their 3rd film yesterday once more directed by actioneer johnnie to fans of to's action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming furthermore fans of cheng lau's previous films needing you love on a diet will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing br br mr mrs to lau cheng are a divorced couple both affluent hk citizens both incredibly mischievous both just happened to be professional thieves 'two birds of the same a couple years earlier they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot now she's remarrying to the son of a rich heiress a total momma's boy carl ng through through the soon to be mother in law jenny woo is suspicious of mrs to's past thinks she's only marrying her son for the family jewels the heiress' priceless ruby necklace br br the necklace is stolen is it mrs to's materialistic eye that gets the best of her or is it her ex husband mr to's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself br br this is not a movie about two falling in love or rekindling a love its about two who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it they let pride greed overwhelm them br br overall yesterday is one part caper heist film one part homage to classic hollywood glamour from its golden years i e cary grant grace kelly's to catch a thief johnnie to is riding too heavily on cheng lau's chemistry from their previous films hoping cheng lau's immense popularity fan base will be enough justification for this third film i think sammi cheng is one of the most likable charming entertainers working lau is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema br br i really enjoyed their first two films consider the cheng lau pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the 40's 50's but yesterday falls very short of expectations terrible writing ridiculous situations product placements galore all the subplots supporting characters were unnecessary come to think of it this film was unnecessary unless you just love celebrity watching
<START> as joe bob briggs would say this movie relies a lot on the actresses' talents rather than their talent this early 1990's show the babes in bikinis fest has very little to redeem it other than showing beautiful women nearly naked joe estevez martin sheen's little brother proves once again that his movie career will be nowhere near what his brother's career is br br avoid this one unless you like watching beautiful women in skimpy clothing it's about the only thing that redeems it
<START> this french film is supposedly about a creepy dim witted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town however the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing if it takes a character ten minutes to walk from point a to point b the film spends ten minutes showing this walk and these are the action scenes there are also static shots that last for minutes making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote the script has enough material for a 20 minute movie the movie lasts seven hours or so you do the math the actors were apparently amateurs and it shows note to self never see a dumont movie again
<START> i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all time best films ever made when i first watched it i was just beginning what has become a life long passion for justice it gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about br br when you have a cast like this one you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous this is by far the best role i have ever seen sean penn play along with i am sam he nails the role doesn't his actions while doing so he manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that i think was very important up until the very end he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is he is a sick man who regrets his past but still makes excuses for it he ends up able to redeem his sense of self worth as much as a convicted and guilty murderer can through the aid of susan sarandon's character sister helen her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them br br the supporting cast was also top notch i was surprised to see a small cameo of jack black in this film given the funny man he has become today i loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art and in my opinion this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far out did the book
<START> feels like an impressionistic film if there is such a thing br br the story is well told very poetic the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters or interpreted by the actors br br the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies not so in my case br br it's a very humanistic film br br the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right br br well done br br a good classic for any good film collection
<START> in the tradition of neo film noir flicks like chinatown this film focuses on a crime mystery in a bleak realm with a bit of character insight blended in the typical noir characters thoughout including the cop out to prove himself a damsel in distress and a bad bad guy sharky's machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its cinematography first plus its direction story strong character acting and superb jazz score available on dvd though the soundtrack itself is out of print but available used on some auction sites filmed on location in beautiful downtown atlanta novelist diehl's hometown and the uncluttered circa 1979 look of the city would make an old time atlanta citizen or visitor long for the old days before 12 lane the city a cinematographer's dream at that time this was rachel ward's first usa feature film
<START> sweet young nurse charlotte beale a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout rosie goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by dr geraldine s masters the excellent annabelle among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable aggressive nymphomaniac allyson king the luscious betty chandler loopy judge oliver w cameron a gloriously hammy gene ross paranoid vietnam veteran sergeant nicely played by hugh gentle giant sam the amiable william bill and nutty old hag mrs the supremely irritating rhea macadams said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by dr masters which of course results in a rash of brutal killings director s f working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by tim pope does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia robert spooky score the grimy set design a few wild grisly murders bruce b grungy no frills cinematography plenty of deliciously robust scenery scarfing histrionics from a game no name cast ross in particular is a total eye rolling hoot and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70's low budget regional horror exploitation cinema
<START> if you're looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosterone pumped carnage craving war buffs out there don't bother although the film is about russian characters in wwii don't expect to see any nazis cannons blood gore etc it's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war it's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it br br acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here you'll certainly appreciate it if you're russian like me but even if not you'll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the ruscico russian cinema council dvd version it's got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the english dubbing on this one i'd say is just as good it's of course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if you're studying film in any aspect
<START> shaky hand held cameras this piece was shot for television mind you not film not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story poor miss austen must be rolling in her grave all i can say is if you enjoyed the novel stop there until the bbc creates one of their smart sensible period masterpieces like pride prejudice with colin firth which speaking for what i imagine in my opinion austen would have revered the bbc would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and indigo girl over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to the specialist if you want austen as you love her look for the bbc logo
<START> as a writer and a lapsed orthodox jewish woman i was let down tremendously by this movie the dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful the characters too engaged with lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the stunningly melodramatic aren't allowed to expand into genuinely textured individuals the one trick musical score tries to make up for the blandness swooping portentously into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of protracted catatonia br br like an adolescent revolutionary on a self righteous tirade this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation patriarchy is wrong and thoroughly squanders its energies hammering on this point the resultant artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures martyrs and grotesques
<START> is all that's wrong with the world all the main characters but brother and freddy are morally bankrupt br br sam damages other people on whim she breaks a kids locker and he is forced to pay a 100 dollars to fix it and all she says is tough luck and moves on to smash freddy's cellphone she just caused at least 300 dollars worth of damage and she is more focused on getting some food what the hell the only time she's every felt guilt is when she made fun of freddy on the show and that's only cause carly the crap out of her br br carly is the i'm perfect everything i do is nice type of girl everything she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown only having remorse for herself what's worse she encourages sam's crap sam ruins some of freddy's clothes she laughs sam ruins a kids grades she shrugs it off br br don't even get me started on the humour the laugh track is played at every moment br br sam he's not that hot carly yes he is sam yeah you're right insane amount of laughter br br the shows humour consists around degrading others and saying obscure words and occasionally bantering on about trivial matters using similar sentences br br not to mention all the 'super cool special techno effects' they do can be done in windows movie maker
