<START> ru paul plays a secret agent called she teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil manners and get her kidnapped niece back or something like that seriously i had trouble concentrating on the plot the movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe add quick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything the dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible the acting is actually pretty ok except for ru paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny after 30 minutes i had to leave because i was bored sick and just couldn't stand it anymore i pride myself on sitting through anything but this went way beyond my limits people are comparing this to the early work of john waters i disagree waters' work is sick but good this is just sick avoid
<START> there was talk on the e hollywood special about the making of dirty dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies maybe the music the dancing or the melodrama around the plot of baby frances becoming a dancing sensation with johnny castle of course this film established jennifer grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in ferris day off patrick swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally dirty dancing has it all to become a broadway or west end smash hit it has the love story the music and most of all lots of dancing jennifer and patrick could revive their roles easily it is nice to see jerry orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and kelly bishop as the mother it all took place in the catskills in the sixties where many jewish families in the area during their summer vacations at the end of the film it is sad to see the hotel owner kellerman be baffled by the next generation it happened anyway most people prefer cruises and traveling through europe than spending the summer in the catskills those old grand hotels are becoming indian gaming casinos let broadway bring dirty dancing alive and well after all they could do it for footloose and saturday night fever this should be a no brainer i know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times there are people that have probably seen this film a 1 000 times by now somehow watching the making and the story behind dirty dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old dirty dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times i watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of baby's first days and her first true love with patrick swayze as heart throb johnny castle nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties i hope they bring it to broadway in a musical it would work for the audience to be part of a film no wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again well australia and london both have had productions of dirty dancing it looks like it will come to broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary
<START> set in paris in the year 1910 a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat duchess voiced by eva gabor and her kittens but the jealous butler edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named thomas voiced by phil harris helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the scat cat voiced by scatman crothers and try to foil edgar's plans br br very entertaining and edgy post walt disney's death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable everybody wants to be a cat good voice acting and some terrific animation for it's time even in these times of computer animation not one of the greatest disney animated movies but a cult disney animated fave and one of the few gems of it's day that works well highly recommended
<START> it's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic it certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all star cast these days it's shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or amc br br it pains me to report that veteran actors like walter pigeon and joan fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty none of which rings true it's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog it's a comic book version of the jules verne novel br br the maturing fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time faring no better are robert sterling barbara eden and most of all peter lorre as well as frankie avalon who gets to sing the title tune which it's safe to say did not become anyone's favorite title tune br br an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence totally unconvincing from start to finish the film as well as the fantastic submarine sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion
<START> this movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience i think that a lot of people get caught up in apparent mental illness as the storyline but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad which is a little clichÃ© but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have whether you see the bad everywhere like leland or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isn't going to work no matter how bad you want it to this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i've seen and it is as depressing a movie as it is good
<START> this movie is all about blaxploitation there is absolutely no plot at all a pimp stops some bad guys with his kung fu to try to get his nightclub back rated r for strong language and a brief sexual situation
<START> it's hard to tell if this ham brained b movie adventure is a spoof a homage or just plain bungled but it doesn't work whichever way you look at it based on michael crichton's so so novel it's a nutty mixture of lost cities giant hippos monster monkeys naff visual effects and corny dialogue the first thing that this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are tim curry turning in a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification and ernie hudson who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish
<START> i bought this film as i thought the cast was decent and i like jennifer rubin patsy kensit br br first off let me say the acting is not of a high standard stephen baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose patsy kensit is so so but not too convincing in some scenes and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her hotel room is utterly meaningless rubbish ms kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately i think jennifer rubin is by far the best in this film ms character is at first innocent then sexy as she plays stephen baldwin's character travis for a fool the supporting cast includes adam baldwin no relation to his more famous m walsh who has appeared in many films also i noticed art evans who was one of john allies in die hard 2 the movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with rubin kensit a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller there is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and stephen character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit a very obvious error in editing br br if you are fans of either of the ladies or either baldwin then you may find something to like here but others should steer clear this is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out in france in my hometown 54 years ago i was nine and today i still remember each black and white frame especially the black ones because it was so tense scary those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain the two soldiers prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the gatling in it firing away the last fight between peck and the chief and the happy end which let me take back my breath i haven't seen it since then and i don't know if it would be a good idea to see it again today it was such a fabulous moment for the kid i was
<START> the opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a ripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment this random act violence sold it for me and i'm happy to say the rest of provided a veritable feast of cheese br br the is about a scientist david who is nearly killed an explosion in his lab whose tattered remains are put inside an experimental body suit armour for some unfathomable reason he is fitted with a rage response a device wired into his brain that will turn him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with any other person they give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but i cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine it is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit what possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission he predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit along with the ninja assassin hunter played by pam grier no really br br the itself looks pretty damn goofy it is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit he also has a perpetually bewildered look in his eyes that doesn't inspire fear or even compassion i guess you can't blame him for that most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces br br the acting is of the really bad stilted 'i'm not sure what the character's emotions or thoughts are that this point so i'll take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random tone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera' school of acting the actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part br br it is after this initial accidental death that the goes after the scientists strangely enough the whole rage response 'touch me and i'll kill you' thing doesn't play as big a role as you might expect with carl going after his former colleges in a reasonably detached manner there was one scene where he rather brutally kills some street punks who push him around i know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if he does look like retarded cousin as it is they don't even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them the only other time this rage response comes up in the movie is when old carl can't give his wife a hug when hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so he'll be forced to kill her he casually remarks he has himself off screen naturally so this doesn't happen they could have left out the whole rage response thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it wouldn't have made a huge difference to the movie br br there is an amusing sequence in the sewers as grier and her cronies track down the due to his armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire acid ' for some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala ghostbusters the fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of grier's goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out the resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man hole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are strangely enough grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the this is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie including the death of funky black scientist when the sends his van of a cliff this is after they capture the by trapping him in a giant lump of no seriously br br there is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which carl's treacherous overweight friend who looks like a poor man's ned beatty reveals his infatuation with carl's wife and tries to rape her it goes on for about 5 10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wife's face gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off it is icky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence br br the movies finale involves the battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits for whatever reason all these other dudes are less kick arse than carl some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out luckily for carl the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw the only really memorable part toward the end is the death of grier doing something i've never seen a baddie do in a movie before in the middle of her confrontation with the she decides she really doesn't stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with his pistol
<START> i know what most of people will think about this movie without even seen it 'the typical movie from a famous singer it will be a pink movie a teenage film it will be stupid ' and stuff like that and yes it is i mean it's a pink movie but you know what i loved it seriously it's a very romantic film i think that every girl in this world has dreamed with something like the plot of met his favorite singer know him as a person and even have a romance with him right i really enjoyed watching that in addition it's really funny br br i think the actors did a great job there's a lot of loving characters and aaron carter jd is not the exception to be honest in the first five minutes of see him act i thought 'this will be but then he surprised me really pleasingly br br also i gotta say that the music performances on the film are great i specially loved the part when jd aaron sings without music only with a guitar a very beautiful song this guy is really talented time will tell br br my advice to you watch it don't make a prejudice
<START> br br i used to like some of the hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s they had icons such as arnie and sly but i think the action movie in the '90s has plummeted to new depths the worst of these i believe was armageddon br br the plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers the melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for bruce willis to disappear from the screen liv tyler who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as bertolucci and robert altman regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon this movie the new hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama that is the norm these days and i begin to wonder if there is a role in hollywood for screenwriters it seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts the rest they leave to technology there is not a single piece of grand heartfelt human emotion in armageddon it just feels empty and bland i can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves liv tyler's dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film steven tyler's band provide a theme song for the movie a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up br br i weep for western civilization if people like this predictable cumbersome movie it stands for shallowness lethargy and a decline in the human intellect i would even prefer to watch the eighth friday the 13th
<START> another brilliant portrayal by kiefer sutherland who plays mickey hayden a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm and i wasn't disappointed with eye of the killer aka after alice i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first
<START> i am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up i honestly said out loud i just rented a two dollar budget christian pos the only thing i could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed horrible actors horrible direction and producing br br the director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room there was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didn't notice you were in the same room the entire movie horrible the two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention but these two and their bios can speak to this are horrible in front of the camera br br don't rent this unless you are blind because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it
<START> this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen it has no good features at all br br it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics br br the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman eh you what br br other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting br br i left the cinema feeling cheated br br needless to say i could not reccomend this film to anyone
