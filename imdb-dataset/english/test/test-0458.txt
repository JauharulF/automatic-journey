<START> the one thing i really can't seem to forget about this movie is its beginning classic comedy brilliantly crafted i love it see it for yourself no spoilers here the sparring between devito and crystal also glows in this movie with devito as the perfect oppressed son one of my favourites highly recommended for fans of crystal
<START> here we have a miniseries which revels in in its flaws and doesn't make us cringe because of them it is excellent story telling which fuses black comedy in a positive way the pathetic waste of war without the sheer unadulterated manipulation of a con job like life is beautiful it is an entertainment not the meaning of life and showcases the talents of actors both young and old give it a go and tell us what you think
<START> i'm one of those for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days i still will check them out every once in a while my observation is that most of them aren't very funny even the ones on major networks that are getting high ratings i just don't get who is finding them gut busting funny while a few have made me crack a smile none of them made me laugh out loud i usually change the channel after a few minutes now on the fox network they churn out new shows like changing your underwear for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom wrong dead wrong they have beat this dead horse so much it is to the point of hiring just anyone they can find to write a crappy pilot with bad dialog and just churn them out let's take a brief look at the latest piece of junk that fox has churned out called the war at home br br i watched about 5 minutes of it and that was generous in this particular episode the daughter is mouthing off to her parents doing the i'm an adult now rant the dad gets fed up tells her ok fine go ahead and do whatever you want if you screw up it's your problem to which she replies well i guess your mad but hey at least i didn't get aids cue the laugh track no way that can be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud such garbage i found the crack about not having aids to be in such bad taste well hey at least i don't have to watch any more of this crap take a hint fox stop wasting your time with sitcoms ok well you have the simpsons but it is now getting really old and tired as well
<START> i'm a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather dull show but season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions the episode hero is an example of what i mean br br the story as it eventually unravels is that the cylons deliberately allow bulldog a pilot captured several years earlier during a black ops mission to escape steal a cylon ship and get back to galactica the plan is that when bulldog gets back he will figure out that adama left him to his fate and be so enraged that he will kill adama which he very nearly does br br now the problem is this the cylons set it up so that bulldog thinks he has escaped by himself this means that bulldog gets off the cylon ship with no assistance so he kills a cylon and walks out of his holding cell that much we see then we must suppose that he walks to the flight hangar manages to get into a cylon fighter ship and learn how to operate it takes off and flies back to galactica just like that br br now starbuck managed to get one of them working in season one which was barely believable in itself but she only had to fly it visually out of orbit before making contact with galactica bulldog has to programme his ship so that it makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch up with galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction how does he manage to programme a ship that contains completely alien technology cylons connect to their computers by touch there are no visual consoles or keyboards and having managed that miraculous feat how does he then know where galactica is bearing in mind that galactica took off some 3 years before and is trying ever since to evade the cylons it does not leave behind even allowing for the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any sci fi show this episode still absolutely no sense whatsoever
<START> for fans of chris farley this is probably his best film david spade plays the perfect cynical sarcastic yin to baby huey yang farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues like the let's say you're driving along the road with your family bit the jo jo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet his possible sale speech or the glue sniffing guarantee fairy brake pad sale the sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with farley and spade's shenanigans even after many viewings it's still fun to see farley pour everything he had into the role richard what's happening to me
<START> i don't think i've ever gave something a 1 10 rating but this one easily gets the denomination i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes it's not just that the jokes are so bad but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma can't set up or finish a punchline and you've got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach br br i have watched the show never in its entirety but many times still it just creeps up on me after conan i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever br br actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest it's just that an interview i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that's screaming get me the hell away from this freak i do recommend watching the show not for a laugh but to ponder how he got on the air and what he's still doing there watch as much as you can i think you will find its complete awkwardness interesting
<START> i just re watched 08th ms gundam for the 2nd time it is so much better than gundam wing i can't wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series this is great to see the gundams actually move about clumsily through the land somebody really thought over writing this move script br br see this today
<START> this rendition of noah's ark has set and turner's reputation back about 100 years however the production has it's bright side a learning experience for neophyte movie in how not to make a movie br br where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations br br ok boys let's saddle up it's too bad that god created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night we're not kissing we're only whispering in each others' mouths br br lumber for building the ark with georgia pacific stamped on it metal nails kids flying kites a peddler how can james coburn sleep after this selling chinese hats pirates attacking a wooden ark which they wished to capture with flaming tar balls of fire shot from glass bottles of wine noah was in a continual state of it was a miracle that he could see the ark let alone build it lady mary in a blond wig tromping around the ark on a white horse still rated g off biblical pirates with an iron teflon lined frying pan landing on mount after having passed through the straights of hercules br br etc etc etc br br special effects you've got to see them in order not to believe them br br the list goes on this movie must not be missed but if you want the full tv version you must call nbc for the screen version but only if you agree to absolve nbc of all responsibility of ever having aired the thing in the first place only the expurgated version exists in video stores no pirates etc that is those video stores that dare to stock it br br marvin cohn br br
<START> there is an interesting split in the voting for this movie at the moment at least those who go expecting a documentary are impressed or at least not disappointed i anticipate that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a re enaction of the invasion of gallipoli br br so if you want to see actors gunfire and gore this film will not suit you if you want to see an independent documentary about gallipoli without bias towards any one side the only enemy in these events was the war itself then you'll come away both impressed and i found it a very moving film and even quite liked captain guy nightingale by the end
<START> the russian space station with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to re enter the earth's atmosphere in a matter of days russia asks for help in rescuing the stranded crew and nasa scrambles the space shuttle atlantis the nsa also have an interest in the a prototype microwave power source being tested aboard and organise for one of their men to be placed on the mission br br that's the plot onto less important things the space station and the shuttle are the same blatantly obvious models used in 'memorial day' and 'dark and a handful of other films i suspect the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s the sets are a little better but are far too '80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy and the and claim the insurance the script has a few good moments including farewell and the little spiel at the end but is otherwise fairly bland and sub standard the acting is okay the only real standout performance comes from alex who offers up some of the film's better dialogue michael dudikoff is surprisingly one of the best parts about this film ice t is ice t 'nuff said the film offers a few surprises though that i don't wish to spoil br br certainly one of the better low grade contemporary set sci fi films of the last six years but not the best the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off rent the other sci fi film instead
<START> let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's which the decline of western civilization documents with the exception of x and black flag being more of new york and english punk guy after i saw this movie that completely changed the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street cree through their lifestyles but it is a great display of hedonism at it's best coupled with some fun loud rock n roll one of the best scenes and actually most insightful is the interview with claude of catholic discipline or boy' as he was known to slash magazine readers originally from france he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk or diy attitude to music politics and life in general darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time but the performance of is pretty decent complete with a young pat smear black performance with chavo pederast on vocals it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band is decent and x and fear give the best performances in the movie look out for the interviews with the young punk kids you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary highly recommended
<START> surface is one of the greatest t v series i have seen the acting is great and the storyline enthralling each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next i especially thought carter jenkins who played miles bennett did a superb job he is a very talented actor and i look forward to seeing more of his work br br i can't believe surface only made one season once again the public has let me down it is hard to fathom that a great shows like this one would get canceled while crap reality shows continue on year after year whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one
<START> the ascent 1976 is an extraordinary gruelling account of the fight against the nazis in german occupied the ascent reflects the russian obsession with the horrors of the great patriotic war but unusually is both steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great russian collaborator the true battle is not with the nazis who hover in the background as mere extras but between the russian nazi investigator and the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death with its many references to the crucifixion the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of the martyr and his influence on future generations a remarkable piece of work
<START> wow an amazing lost piece of and a lost 70s glam rock film rolled into one this film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm as a retelling of the oz story the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities the chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in australia will delight fans of the genre this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show an indicator of the type of film that oz is while not as frivolous or well constructed as it's hard not to have fun with oz br br surprisingly oz has aged well perhaps a by product of how determinedly set in the real australia of 1976 it is the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream the willingness of the film to give prominence to gay characters is notable especially as it dates to the period for the australian gay rights push br br the performances range from amateur to finely nuanced brilliance the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two somehow these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully unpretentious much like australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm br br there are several connections to the original australian of the rocky horror show which will keep obsessives on their toes br br oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review laugh at the atrocious 70s fashion swing along with the soundtrack leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight
<START> and that's saying a lot rent this if you want to be staggered by oddness blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts direction and casting in the history of films i'm staggered i can't believe i watched it i'm a big bernadette peters fan normally but this tested my resolve don't read any more reviews here it's best if you know nothing about the plot just rent it you won't believe what you're seeing
