<START> mishima a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day cinematography accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan's greatest novelists whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture as any gifted character mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts the main of them being the conflict between the pen and a sword as the director puts it in his final chapter or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the traditional side of mishima himself br br all schrader's films and the ones he wrote scripts for are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in that also goes for mishima who apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play film like this comes along once in a long while and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty 20 out of 10

<START> once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker br br now unfortunately he not only makes terrible films but puts his names to ones like this br br a supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s this plumbs new depths br br believe you me i enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this to use a word i never thought i would its you see i can't even spell it the plot in the vaguest sense of the term is as incomprehensible as vinnie jones' accent the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think of br br this is just terrible shocking it almost made me cry in horror
<START> the movie adaptation of heart of darkness is disappointing both as a movie and as a representation of joseph conrad's classic story br br there are several small differences between the book and movie but that's expected in any book to movie transition kurtz dies in a different location the manager does not accompany marlow on his voyage mistress spends much more time with him than in the story the real issue is the amount of footage that's put into the movie but has no basis in the actual story for some reason the director finds the need to spice up a few of the scenes adding drama or actions that seldom make any sense and are always unimportant to the story some examples that come to mind are mistress beating marlow over the head and knocking him out nothing happens while he's unconscious and marlow didn't even provoke the attack a couple hours pass and he wakes up total waste of time kurtz has a pet monkey which for some random reason he kills on a whim also when marlow leaves station he makes the noble decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had obtained for no real reason at all one other flaw is character john malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational a man with a commanding presence he practically whispers all of his lines which in a more capable actor's hands could have been very thought provoking i can't remove the image of john malkovich playing a mentally disabled in of mice and men when i'm watching him botch the role of kurtz over all i would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars it's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it in movie form perhaps to help you visual the scenes but as a source of entertainment i would never recommend it
<START> grand champion is a bit old fashion at first glance andrew morton at the fort worth star telegram said it best if walt disney had hailed from texas he would have made grand champion br br the movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul the kids are great and the array of stars is incredible i bet bruce willis and julia roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see g rated br br this is a masterfully crafted simple little film made in texas by texas barry take your kids take your kids friends take grandma too they will all enjoy it and you will too
<START> one of the commentators on the subject of lil' pimp of glen cove got it right when he she stated that the movie is really bad but i take exception when he she commented on the animation br br the animation wasn't bad because of macromedia flash it was bad animation because it was directed wrong flash is just a tool in the right hands an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any disney film and in the wrong hands it can look as bad as the stuff on the internet which is where lil' pimp originated and should've stayed there br br studios such as cartoon network nickelodeon disney and warner bros create wonderful animation using flash i e puffy ami yumi foster's home for imaginary friends etc br br lil' pimp was an ill conceived piece of tripe that was made because revolution studios bought media tripp and lil' pimp was one of the properties included roth and company thought they'd make a quick buck exploiting a turd like lil' pimp and the sham was perpetuated by it's producer amy the reason for this third trimester abortion of an animated film is that none of the executives at revolution studios had the pragmatic brains to sideline mark brooks and peter they really tried their best but were way in over their heads and hire real writers directors and at least a semi competent producer they did one thing correctly though they hired some of the best designers and animators in la but as lil' pimp demonstrates one can buy the best sports car on the floor but if you're a moron you'll wreck it for sure
<START> being a wrestling fan movies about wrestling generally suck backyard dogs jesse ventura story but this one isn't the worst i've ever seen yes its bad but its better than some of the others i've mentioned br br hulk hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network let me explain it so everyone can understand picture usa network having rip and tnt will go to any lengths to get him br br does this make sense no well don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a real fight with rip at the end of the movie br br none of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later hogan films its not so bad br br 4 out of 10
<START> missed it at the cinema but was always slightly compelled found it in the throw out bin at my local video shop for a measly two bucks will i now give it away to anyone who wants it probably no purposeful plot one dimensional characters plastic world ripped off from many far better films no decent dialogue to speak of you know that empty feeling when you come down off ecstasy its that feeling right here sad thing is the australia i know is heading in this direction minus the melodrama and simple answers interesting only to see the older aussie actors who had to act back in their day to get by vs the newer aussie actors who have to look good to get by like some horribly garish narrative introduction to a film clip that never actually starts poor kylie started her career as an actress as well
<START> this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason definitely not a well made movie so unbelievable the scenes where the president holbrook were downtown and walking among the people were a farce there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life if it wasn't for the blood and profanity this was shot like a tv movie it could have been decent if it was done differently holbrook's president talents were never realized in this movie shatner's acting is okay the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired overall i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair
<START> an oirish film not made for an irish audience with fiorentino and spacey each of a half decent oirish accents the powers that be had but one choice force the irish actors to adopt equally bad oirish accents reducing the whole thing to the lowest common denominator
<START> this review may contain spoilers the decline of western civilization what a great title eh and of coarse a great movie this is the best concert film i have ever seen a close second being the talking heads movie stop making sense i first heard of this movie when waynes world came out in 1992 i looked at the director's name penelope and thought cool name what else has he directed i thought the first name was pronounced like envelope after some time looking in movie guides i came across the critically acclaimed decline and realized penelope was a woman my mom corrected me i spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down i finally saw it on vhs in vancouver where i currently reside it was worth the wait this captures the la punk movement very well this is teen angst at it's best folks my favourite is the band the germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because darby crash sings so crazy you cannot understand it i laughed when i saw this the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band x are a very intelligent bunch also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the whales there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in i became a huge penelope fan after this and saw all her punk movies dudes was ok and suburbia is a cult classic i own both of these on vhs she is a true underground film maker and i love her stuff i would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular i was a big nirvana fan then but alas i saw this in 2002 and by that point i had grown out of grunge and now i listen to crystal method fatboy slim quite a change of pace i know but what can you do but if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything much better than 1991 the year punk broke this is a tough movie to track down but if you get your hands on it rent it even if you don't like the music it is an excellent piece of work now days it might be easier to find with dvd's being so popular by the way penelope produced a little known albert brooks movie called real life which i also own very funny stuff in todays reality tv craptacular rent decline highly recommended thanks
<START> although it's definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it's always worth a watch this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons firstly after the first forty five minutes or so it focuses heavily on helen and johnny who are far less interesting characters than most of the others janet jennifer george and miss are all much more enticing although at first this works since in life we don't always know everything about everyone else and because the point is being made that perhaps helen is slightly self involved it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters br br secondly the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half the letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and again although this works well in some ways it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind br br overall this film is sweet and good natured with some genuinely hilarious moments for example janet explaining to an avid audience the lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed but the film isn't quite as intelligent as it's trying to be it just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life however it's still good and if you get the chance it's definitely worth seeing
<START> why is this one no good when the first one rocked try the fact that they attempted to replace rodney dangerfield with jackie mason please that's like replacing the beatles with wierd al randy quaid is the only one that saves this movie from a zero br br however don't let this stop you from watching the first movie which was outstanding
<START> i saw the d's new film tonight at a special advance screening and i was so blown away by its sheer greatness that i felt i had to come onto imdb and get the word out admittedly i was already a huge fan of the d's work i loved the hbo series and listen to their music weekly there's nothing better to sing along to but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen with tenacious d's the pick of destiny this is not the case br br simply put this film rocks harder than anything i've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything peter jackson pixar and will ferrell together could produce it tells the story of the d before we came to know them setting up intriguing histories of kage and upbringings their comings together and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as lee sasquatch and dio most importantly they reveal the true inspiration to the greatest song in the world tribute and how it came to be which is different than the hbo series' version after you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it hence the tribute but your mind forever be changes by its genius br br i don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking paying outrageous concession prices etc but i usually make exceptions when it's starring someone i really love or concerning something of the the same variety the pick of destiny was so good that i have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide and i plan on convincing all of my friends to go too last week we saw borat and loved it but this is honest to goodness ten times better for anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance see this film these guys' talent is so great you should have no hesitation supporting their cause you will not be disappointed and the rock lords will smile upon you favorably
<START> without doubt one of the worst films ever made sluggish and without structure tension or story the film coasts on the thin premise of putting together a show conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental everything is put together in a slapdash order and often stepping out feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie the film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random liza musical numbers shelly winters can be seen in the far superior epic tentacles and the real liza can be found in the showtime release of queer duck the movie
