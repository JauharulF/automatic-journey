<START> well i have to say this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year and i don't exactly mean that in a good way this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while and yet that's what makes it so hilarious you can tell these people are really trying to act unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying this movie is so bad it's actually good i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh
<START> i see alot of movies at the cinema 103 so far this year and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year even though it was released back in 1954 br br i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print br br the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist pure quality br br although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour br br not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort br br if you ever get a chance to see this movie please do not hesitate it's a classic br br
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen if i wasn't watching it for free i would have never finished it the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves it seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of scary movie and date movie a terrible movie but 10x better than this one but failed miserably the only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick a guy falls down someone gets hit by a bus etc none of the ideas are clever basically the worst premise for a movie ever the plot or lack thereof is completely retarded the plot seems to center around the coach and his family however there are so many other things going on in the movie it is completely ridiculous terrible terrible movie
<START> cheaply made poorly acted and unimaginatively directed flight to mars still is entertaining despite what its has going against it a flight to mars is planned with five people three older gentleman cameron mitchell as a newspaperman and one female scientist obvious love interest the ship the spaceship gets there and finds that very human like martians live there and have technological advances that would make earth blush but all is not rosy in the subterranean cities of the martians here shown as some caves and a few rooms the martians are a dying planet and one faction wants the earthlings to fix the ship only to take it away at the last moment and then for an attack on earth and another faction wants to talk peace and see if they cannot persuade earth to give them living space the special effects here are pretty lame even for 50's sci fi standards complete with slow moving rocket ship pastel neon alien garb where the women wear shorts that would make many blush except the men of course and little less offered cameron mitchell is the journalist and is affable if nothing else marguerite chapman is beautiful in very short shorts but adds little acting range the rest of the cast is filled with some older sci fi veterans like arthur franz and morris doing serviceable jobs this isn't a premiere sci fi film from the golden age by any standard but it is very watchable and zips by at fast pace
<START> this movie came out about the same time as pretty woman while the general theme is the same wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman the characters of and juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them i have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to pretty woman in so many ways juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer the final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy the efforts makes to win the love of juliette surpass the puny climbing scene of pretty woman a hundred times over see this movie it will warm your heart
<START> the movie inhabited is about a family of four moving into a new house not knowing that dangers are lurking the daughter befriends the dangerous creatures as they gain her trust when they do they use it against her a man who use to live there as a child or a teen knows about the creatures and try's to warn them the creatures steel and take shiny objects to make new stuff out of them mostly weapons they has a cat and it murderously disappeared the man that tried to warn the little sister was tricked by them and end up into a psyciatric ward she then help them defeat the creatures and destroy the man one after they do they leave for good with nothing but each other and something happens to the doctor
<START> i absolutely love this movie evil dead has nothing on this film night of the demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest but this one is a classic it's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie stooge has some of the best one liners to ever hit the screen in this one he's my favorite character a lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie but my personal favorite is the ending sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over halloween apples in a pie and his throat is mangled from the inside out the sound track is awesome the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy especially after the strobe light comes on and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing the make up effects in this movie are pretty sweet angela gave me nightmares as a kid if you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience you might want to give this one a pass but if you're like me and you really dig the whole halloween haunted house with the demons clichÃ© than this one is definitely a must own
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune to see the general idea of a mass ejection hitting the planet earth with em disruption is fair enough but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained the acting was so terrible i got the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people off of santa monica boulevard and threw them in front of the camera in all honesty i have seen less wooden acting from my ironing board sorry but this film was poor poor poor
<START> this one is about a homicide detective who battles a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up they seem to outwit the police force seemingly at will they taunt the detective by planting clues and leading them off on a wild goose chase this one has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie sandra bullock does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge not sure of herself and battling her inner demons she can't seem to keep a man in her life especially partners they seem to keep leaving her for some reason altogether this isn't a bad film it keeps you guessing all the way the very shocking ending
<START> this is the worst movie that i have ever seen at first i thought that it was going to be good because i'm interested in the bermuda triangle but instead it was terrible all it did was offer a bunch of lame that didn't make sense if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age and her son aged rapidly and have a horrible sappy ending next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list
<START> directed by michael curtiz four daughters is about four musically gifted sisters their suitors and their father a minor conductor playing sardonic quick talking mickey borden is john garfield in the role that made him an instant star the movie also stars claude rains as adam and the lane sisters lola rosemary and priscilla and gale page as his spirited daughters its definitive scene takes place in the living room cigarette hanging from his lips borden is playing one of his own compositions priscilla lane's ann tells him the piece is beautiful but he says it stinks he continues it hasn't got a beginning or an end only a middle ann urges him to create a beginning and an end borden replies what for the fates are against me they tossed a coin heads i'm poor tails i'm rich but they tossed a two headed coin audiences loved the way garfield in his tough city voice said it stinks that scene created garfield's screen persona as the eternal outsider four daughters is a slice of americana with garfield in a compelling performance supplying more than a hint of darkness br br
<START> robert mckimson's bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts although the circus based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson's dreadful 'big top bunny' bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at there's a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion in a brilliant disney parody he pinocchio down the lion's throat this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'laugh clown which as a child i used to impersonate regularly all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name i've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an funny short which stands amongst mckimson's best
<START> maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv movie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that cranked out is written all over this production obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie but rather this was concocted in a board room somewhere then produced with cold efficiency there is some talent among the cast but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter but will is stuck once again playing another dumb character though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his boy meets world role the background for this movie is washington d c and the white house but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty the disney channel presents a lot of original tv movies and most of them are better than this
<START> there's a sign on the lost highway that says br br major spoilers ahead br br but you already knew that didn't you br br since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie i'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense as others have pointed out one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient if you have the dvd of md you can cheat by looking at david lynch's top 10 hints to unlocking md but only upon second or third viewing please br br first of all mulholland drive is downright brilliant a masterpiece this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate but it gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark br br david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it cinematography wise has great acting esp naomi watts a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti and a very dream like quality to it but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before after all when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about regardless of whether they liked it or hated it br br allright enough about all that it's time to justify those statements br br most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion a dream sequence br br of course that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again br br md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor camilla due to diane's lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations upon realizing that camilla will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam the director she hires a hitman to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces br br the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some 50s dance jitterbug contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and applauding her br br no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it there's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits the camera moving into an object although blurry and the scene quickly fading out if you look closely the object is actually a pillow revealing that what follows is a dream br br the main characters seen in the first half of the movie br br betty diane imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dream sequence a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at notice that in the dream version the name is br br rita the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that through diane's dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident is turned into an amnesiac this makes her vulnerable and dependent on diane's love she is then conveniently placed in betty diane's aunt's luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in br br coco in real life adam's mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in she's mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the film br br adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty diane since she develops such hatred towards him br br aunt ruth diane's real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for murder br br mr roach a typical lynchian character not real appears only in diane's dream sequence he's a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaks br br the hitman the person that murders camilla this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that below br br now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out chronologically but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to hint sheet br br as i mentioned above camilla was re produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with md is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't i've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo br br only one of the cars actually hit the limo what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldn't they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as ebert so eloquently puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences lingers over what it finds fascinating dismisses unpromising plotlines br br shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruth's apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare br br although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think they're actually her parents since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest perhaps she didn't know them all that well and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life br br a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept part in the movie from adam's party in the second half of the movie and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminal br br this scene i think is also lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie br br gotta love that 'something just bit me bad' line though br br the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene br br when reaching the corner a bum like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in diane's mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her translate into that poor guy's nightmares the bum also signifies diane's evil side as can be witnessed later in the movie br br the cowboy constitutes along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape diane only saw him for a short while at adam's party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etc br br the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times indicating to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicide br br the espresso scene with the brothers where we can see badalamenti the composer as luigi is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adam's party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch br br during the scene in which they enter diane's apartment the body lying in the bed is camilla but notice how she's assumed diane's sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness since diane did not know where or when the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off she just put her into her own home br br in real life diane's audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance br br also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for murder now appears in rita purse this is part of diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasn't taken place br br when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped ashtray another hint is given she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy br br the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman photo resume br br the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed there's much symbolism going on here the box may represent diane's future it's empty or it may be a sort of a pandora's box the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open either way it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum br br club is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s he is viewing is not real it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from even in her dreams br br during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears br br anyway that is my 0 02 hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect without realizing the plot br br as usual lynch is all about creating irrational fears and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well br br 10 out of 10
<START> this is a disaster movie in both meanings of the word every character every role every conversation every twist everything in this movie stinks big time it's a shame to see dennis hopper's talent wasted in this dreadful movie i can give you of examples but see for yourself br br or rather don't
