<START> i have seen this play many times from olivier to branagh and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory many actors have captured aspects of this character but for me it is always derek jacobi's performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short
<START> i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the drive in at the circle drive in in long beach the title was hammer of god from which i can never forget for some reason but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever br br my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie from time to time the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i'm talking about br br if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie if anyone is aware of its availability please inform me
<START> this is a title in search of a movie it's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned when this film was made there were still two things that cgi did not do at all well people and fur furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer this is the only example i can think of where effects for a well funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie for the record the design of the werewolves doesn't help a bit the film makers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and tried to do both and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way the transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between ron perlman and a hyena but back to the crass part this is a movie which exists purely to cash in on its i am not a fan of original film but boy does it look good in light of this if you thought some of humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here the bubble gum scene the corpse humor the dog that you know you'll just have to watch that bit yourselves thomas everett scott is on vacation in europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the ugly and jump off the eifel tower in the middle of the night this leads to him rescuing a young woman delpy julie it's not worth this just to become a star in america ask rutger hauer from jumping to her death she turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting to i'm not sure something bad ghastly french stereotypes gaping plot holes a muddled ending no matter the studio cared only that the title would likely fool millions of american werewolf in london fans into handing over their cash for the most part happy to say they were wrong
<START> not having seen this film in quite some time we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred criterion dvd le rouge is a film that owes a lot to other movies as it keeps reminding us about rififi the asphalt jungle among others because they all deal with capers that take center stage in the movie and reproduce it in great detail unfortunately one knows that old adage that crime does not pay and from the start these men involved in it are doomed from the onset br br jean pierre melville was a director of few words he didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog as it's the case here yet for not being talky they had a style of their own as proved with le le samurai and his masterpiece bob le among others mr melville had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did in this film working with his cinematographer henri he takes us along for a ride through the streets of paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in france the score is by eric that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action br br although the film shows alain delon as corey at the center of the action it is however the smart inspector mattei who is the real hero of the movie as played by the great he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch vogel and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is tailing looms large behind it gives an enormously satisfying performance as mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness as it's the case with the three cats he adores br br alain delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in pictures in here he is corey the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery his association with vogel and jansen pays off in the way they get the job done but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart br br gian maria and yves montand are seen as vogel and jansen respectively they were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows mr montand has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head br br jean pierre got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film that although feels a bit longer but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director
<START> if you can stomach the campiness this movie should make you laugh out loud several times it did for me at least i'll only mention one of my favorite elements the underwater shots of the fish swimming the sound which accompanies those shots is great too br br one last note william katt is actually a pretty decent actor i hope he gets another day in the sun watching him as the greatest american hero was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago and he hasn't been very visible since he seemed kind of depressed in this movie somebody give him a fun job on a good show or something
<START> trilogies are very interesting some go out with a bang lord of the rings some get progressively weaker the matrix some get lost in obscurity blade back to the future but some maintain the genius that seemingly ever growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior case and point three colors trilogy this chapter in the trilogy being the last one is the most philosophical and thought provoking in blue we had a more visually stunning more character driven plot in white it was more of a light hearted narrative driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything red however is focused on the what ifs and how comes it questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present br br this chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner she soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his phone calls through advanced spying equipment all three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines but bring a lot more to the story consider in blue the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones we are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary french society and how that reflects the character's behavior red is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life but it is also about chance hope and fate br br irene jacob stars as valentine who at first finds the old man jean louis trintignant whom we never find the name of extremely self centered and disgusting though through self reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if only he was 40 years younger irene lives across from another younger judge who highly resembles the old man this is the what if that keeps circling in the movie what if irene were born 40 years ago the old man would have been her perfect match but what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match since he so closely resembles the older one valentine doesn't know this only we do and kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which irene is in we are constantly smacked in the face with his presence as almost a suggestion of fate br br i mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason that reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story we are to compare the old judge to auguste jean pierre the younger judge in more than one way we learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away in another scene we see auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man there are constant reminders of whether or not valentine will ever meet this man even though they pass each other without noticing every single day there is also the motif of the telephone to valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life to auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak and to the old man it is the only thing he has left these three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology it is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are br br all three colors films stand for a certain principle most common in france blue stands for liberty the personal being white stands for equality being accepted by more than one and red is fraternity to socialize to learn and although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the fraternity principle kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well in order to connect all three stories for example we see the old man trying to reach out to valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment which is a reflection of the equality principle we also see near the end that valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others not picking up the phone when michel calls a clear example of liberty and with all three principles established kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well in the final and most heartfelt scene br br red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger it is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone and whether or not one person can change your life the final chapter in the most awe inspiring trilogy ever made this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling it is not only about our modern life but about where life could and should be in our modern time and although the movie is more subtle than both blue and white it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion br br it's hard to imagine that red was kieslowski's last film and that he died at such a young age nevertheless the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with bergman fellini and wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an oscar kieslowski you have been missed
<START> i saw this in the cinema during its initial release and can only ask has the world gone mad the seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind boggling for this poorly written predictable clap trap br br stephan elliot is no genius film maker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since check out 'welcome to 'eye of the br br i can only assume making a film dealing with the gay transexual culture has people assuming that to dislike the film is an offense to this sector of the populace aren't we smarter than that what about an interesting script and good performances ok so the 3 leads do alright considering what they have to work with but this film includes the worst performance by a child actor i have ever seen not helped by appalling dialogue and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile off br br this is a disappointing film and one that doesn't deserve the overblown reputation it has garnered
<START> this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen the visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out and the frequent black and white to color switch i also thought that the story didn't make any sense what so ever and it was another clichÃ©d action movie with a hero a bad guy and a few hostages i could make a better movie than that with my own camera why i can hold it steady something the director couldn't do over all truly the worst i have ever seen you thought disney was bad i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing because i'm sure i could guess the outcome and the visual were the worst i have ever seen
<START> well i like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of and well because the um director and others chose an extremely great actor to play mike and also my last reason because my opinion elijah wood is so so hot
<START> is by far the best outsider's take on bollywood i have ever seen i didn't grow up with bollywood but i've seen a few hundred of them now i'd say it leaves gurinder chadha mira nair and even merchant and ivory of bombay talkie almost in the dust willard carroll the director really loves bollywood and he has the self confidence to allow us to know it there's humor but no arch ironic distancing no of course i don't really mean this stuff as jerry lee lewis would say he gets it and so he can let us have it too the joy of a bollywood movie experience along with touches that are supplied by a westerner's stepping into the story role br br it's a story about a caustic bitchy beautiful american b movie actress she's only been in movies with numbers in their titles like fatal attraction 3 who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in sutra 3 has folded its tents while she was en route apparently because its producers are now in jail salman khan in real life a bollywood mega mega star is the dancing master of the delightful written on the fly movie she has now been pulled into is this before or after i go blind and through the sweetness of his mildly psychically gifted character she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability br br the strong beginning gives you both bollywood a super energetic troupe of dancers in front of the taj mahal both funny an familiar to the western viewer as well as providing the high velocity musical thrill we love in a hindi movie and salman on screen from the outset no bollywood 20 minute wait for the hero he has on an indian costume embellished with kit carson style western movie fringe all in white br br ali actress character is pleasing to the western viewer she's blonde which is traditional for a white person in a bollywood movie and visually understandable casting but she's a robust girl not the ethereal kind of blondie we're usually presented with and she's a more or less three dimensional total bitch carrying on profane and abusive cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the us br br we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of groom let alone strangers unrelated people let alone bar going so the spirit is the same the details are fresh and i was completely delighted by this br br i only saw it once at a preview showing attended by the director a fine speaker and question he and salman got to be brother like good friends over the making of it he loves india he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india i can't get too detailed about songs when i've seen them just once except to say i liked them all they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the movie within the movie the ladies' costumes with hats and seashell cased bodices it's a beach scene on dresses are worth the cost of a ticket alone to a lovely reflective many scened romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the movie br br mix of hindi and english in the music and it works br br salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects this and jaan e mann and good judgment about which ones to be in carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way and totally fine i e not narcissistic at all whether carroll accepted or rejected them clearly just a pro who loves being involved and collaborating
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> this game is not exactly the best n64 game ever sure it's good but only when there's 4 players without 4 players the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill but half of this game are levels where you have to save so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels and that gets quite boring the graphics don't exactly reach the level of super mario 64 or even mario kart 64 and if you're talking a great multiplayer in a 1st person shooter you'll have to go with perfect dark at least you can play multiplayer by yourself
<START> this is the middle cartoon of the three between rabbit fire and duck rabbit duck and is the weakest of the three while still being quite funny it simply depends on one gag for too much of the action still a good cartoon i feel a definite sympathy for daffy in this one which is rare for me daffy is so clearly that it almost becomes painful to watch at times good cartoon in an excellent series recommended
<START> prey br br aspect ratio 1 37 1 br br sound format mono br br a lesbian couple sally faulkner and glory living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man barry who turns out to be a flesh eating alien the vanguard of a massive invasion br br despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing norman j warren's follow up to satan's slave 1976 amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff apparently his only writing credit faulkner and indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v eye catching cinematography though discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one or both of these doe eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed which may explain the absence of their respective families some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and under mysterious circumstances unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because is attracted to him creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence there's an extraordinary multi layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing though alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery br br in the early scenes at least the relationship between faulkner and is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity but this heartfelt liaison quickly devolves into crowd pleasing episodes of sex and culminating in an explosion of horror when allows herself to be ravished by following a violent argument with faulkner the closing sequences are quite literally gut wrenching especially final scene which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored what remains is still pretty vivid so brace yourselves excellent performances by the three leads bolstered by warren's unobtrusive direction which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings originally released in the us as alien prey
<START> dictator of is a spoiled child who becomes angry when he cannot gets what he really wants and what he simply wants is nothing less than the world br br in one of the extraordinary scenes of chaplin art performs a ballet with the 'world' which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp br br chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films in a scene at the beginning of the movie which takes place during world war i the messenger crashes the plane and thinks he is about to die in a state of delirium he begins to say ridiculous words the empty double talk continue ascending into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of war films br br in another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the jewish ghetto and assumes command of the resistance fomenting rebellion among the old men he plans to kill the dictator one of the group must kill the ruthless conqueror of whoever is chosen will naturally die but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in history br br the sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear br br for all its disappointing shortcomings the great dictator is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither chaplin nor anymore else could have given it the irony of history the necessity to murder presages the assassination attempt against hitler by his generals the force of the original satire is only surpassed by history's imitation of art br br with a splendid sequence like the duck shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the humbly jewish barber and vice versa the great dictator is chaplin's first talking movie this time and not ' wanting to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy the last in which he uses his celebrated character '
