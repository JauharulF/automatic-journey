<START> well after seeing beginning i thought why the hell they burned version and did that poor one but now after seeing dominion i deeply understand this decision even they got it not much better br br sorry but this movie is really crap some good moments but a really boring story telling and some major plot holes are killing this movie br br i thing the exorcist story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see but there is so much little of it in the movie the effects are really bad not even tv standard
<START> the nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end it is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle still if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels if you like senseless cookie cutter you'll like this otherwise you should pass
<START> i watched this movie miniseries on television back in 1989 and it was an amazing movie i would love to track down a copy of it just to watch it again and again it's been 15 years since i watched it and it still sticks out in my mind br br from the beginning it draws you in the characters and plot line keep holding you the ending was superb the feeling and rage that the son displayed when finding out the truth about his father are unforgettable the suspense on how it will turn out and how he will confront his father is really intense br br if you can get a copy of this movie you will thoroughly enjoy watching it br br then email me and tell me where i can get a copy
<START> this movie is truly worth seeing robin tunney excels and henry thomas proves that he's one of those rarities the child 'actor' who grows up to become a real actor the characters are perfectly drawn and in the wrong hands because of their depth they could have been unconvincing but all the actors are simply astounding the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of girl interrupted both movies coincidentally star the brilliant clea duvall the score and music selections fit perfectly and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study if you want the story you won't find it in this review but i will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time
<START> i must admit at first i was worried about farscape the opening segment was not very strong and i began to worry about what was to come however once it set in to familiar henson territory with the wry sense of humor the unique and enduring characters and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction the story follows john crichton played by ben browder a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion however during the first test his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners on the starship and the peacekeepers human enforcers he is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners ka a warrior a priestess xvi a deposed ruler and sun a who has reluctantly joined the crew with excellent special effects moderate make up and puppets and robots that exceed the henson standard of perfection as well as a very well written story and character driven plot farscape looks to be a fantastically original creative and clever science fiction series
<START> the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent the conversation went along the lines of 'do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan michael caine and michael are already in ' this is a dull 'comedy' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss whose arrival is imminent to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie it can't even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background actually steals the show and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man but overall the result is disappointing and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa
<START> i was 19 years old when i saw first saw this film in the theater i have a vivid memory of a different ending not completely different but significantly i just watched the movie last night and i was wrong so i guess the following can't be called a spoiler since it never happened the ending i remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked frances austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera only his face was in the frame and it was pretty obvious he was letting it happen albeit against his will but nothing like this showed up in the movie sandy dennis was 32 years old when she made this movie michael burns was 22 in the movie he complains to his sister that frances makes too big a deal about sex yeah well then so go to bed with her dude and get it over with wtf
<START> it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy holly's death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in iowa who remember it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died the world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy br br i watched the film today some thirty years after it's original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the band's name but most of all i remember the music it's hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or that'll be the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes i'm with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them funny how each successive decade brought it's own threat to the fabric of society the beatles motown disco and a whole host of other musical forms we're still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldn't have been all that bad br br there was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasn't seeing things my way i've done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so now br br you certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddy's band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on their presence br br i'll always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties they call them now i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen which only goes to reinforce the idea that i'll keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die
<START> possible spoilers br br i've read up on dahmer a little and saw the new dahmer film with the same name at an earlier time this movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on dahmer himself the film called dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself br br i did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the probation officer it also seemed as if the dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor but i might be wrong about that br br what annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway that is ok but what i then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened it's not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out what wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was dahmers sexual obsession with the dead again i don't mind they didn't show it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow br br conclusion i think the really good dahmer film is still to be made a movie that incorporates not only dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did i think that 1 5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all this movie was just a cutout excuse the pun of dahmers life and personality and does not give you any to good' insight into his life or personality br br 4 10
<START> winning 26 out of the 28 awards it was nominated for there is no doubt that this film will stand as one of the best of 2007 the fact that it was made with non professionals who were trained to act and dance makes it that much more special br br it is not a bollywood production but it is about art a lower caste girl wants to sing and dance she wants to move up in society but there is a limit everyone cannot be president in india there is a caste system and the narrow minds will not allow it to be breached br br quits school at 15 and goes to work for the landlady urmila who was once an accomplished dancer after some time working the animals she is taught to sing and dance the film is strikingly beautiful with rich color it is amazing what can be done with 20 000 as this film was a master's project for the writer director br br the son karan singh returns from america to run for office and is struck by the girl but she is lower caste and can only be a vessel for his lust things are no better at home as her father drinks and eats and steals her money she ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the landlady br br in the end she never rises above her caste but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good
<START> stay away from this movie at all costs i was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the t worst movie of all time needless to say this one won hands down it is long and drawn out and has no purpose or plot from what i can gather a movie about a killer kid raised from a fetus that was grown outside the womb just has no place inside your vcr if you are extremely bored and have no life watch this movie but if you rather keep your sanity stay away
<START> fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot wise and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad but the premise is engaging the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing it's a shame the story is such a wreck there are a couple of places where i had no idea what just happened it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you'd got there the movie is poor at explaining things and some things don't make a lot of sense but the movie moves along so its flaws barely register not a great movie by any means but definitely a fun one
<START> is one of the worst movies i ever seen most of the time this is fine and i can go on with my life but i feel the need to warn others in this case as a veteran of the iraq war i feel it necessary to say that the story plot acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage it was as if the director writer whoever latched on to whatever clichÃ© about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it not to mention i would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film the marine uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first iraq war i won't go on forever this is a horrible movie if you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives i recommend going to your local library
<START> i should live this film but i don't it won international awards it is foreign i usually like such films it is slow moving again something i like and it has no gratuitous sex or violence the problem is that it is boring we have two friends from the same village in turkey one successful the other not the unsuccessful one comes to istanbul to stay with the successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea both live lives that are unfulfilling pointless and petty br br well it isn't the first time this kind of film has been made i didn't see anything new being added to this tired theme there are long takes that are just someone standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching tv i do understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their loves while it does do that i got the idea in the first 15 min i don't need to be beaten over the head with it for the rest of the two hours br br the symbolism is also a bit heavy handed the plate of live type fish with one off the plate and flopping around in its death throws symbols are best when they are not obvious but are there in the background creating a mood just slightly below the viewer's awareness br br the film is so apathetic that it doesn't even rate a score of 1 so i gave it a 2 to rate a 1 takes a talent at being bad this film didn't have that much energy
<START> every movie i have ppv'd because leonard maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks every single one when will i ever learn br br is a raving old bag who thinks nothing of saying she's dying of breast cancer to get her way laura is an insufferable medusa filled with the holy spirit and her hubby's protÃ©gÃ© caught between these harpies is dumb as a rock boy who has been pressed into weed pulling servitude by the old bag br br as i said when will i ever learn br br i was temporarily lifted out of my malaise when the old bag stuck her head in a sink but unfortunately she did not die i was temporarily lifted out of my malaise again when medusa got mowed down but unfortunately she did not die it should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this br br without harry potter to kick him around rupert is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of its sockets julie scenery chewing especially the scene when she plays god is even more shameless than her character br br at least this harold bangs some bimbo instead of maude for that i am truly grateful and if you're reading this mr maltin you owe me 3 99
