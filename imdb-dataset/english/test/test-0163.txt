<START> usually i do not like movies with about aliens but k pax is different the actors are great in the movie especially kevin spacey played his character breathtaking the movie never fall to a lower level the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends what's about you have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions is robert porter or is only using robert porters body as a means of transportation how can he see uv light and how can he know that much about but everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe very good movie with an excellent kevin spacey
<START> late film critic gene siskel said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie he was giving it a compliment even though now that might have been taken as an insult these days even though i didn't always agree with gene siskel i agree with him here love jones is a shining example of how a love story should be realistic with real characters in real situations br br the story chronicles the ups and downs of the relationship between darius larenz tate and nina long larenz tate and long are more than just a beautiful couple on screen these two actually have chemistry together you can feel the vibe between these two whenever the are on screen and its fantastic br br bill bellamy is pretty funny as the deceitful wood and lisa nicole carson is great as nina's friend simone isaiah washington is just as great as close friend and i sigh every time i see him in a movie the guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by industry lowlifes and the childish games they play you can believe that he called the little weasel on grey's anatomy out of his name but anybody that knows how follywood works knows better than to believe any official story from the place of make believe at any rate br br love jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and likable characters that are in realistic situations that anybody that has been in love can relate too you love these people because they are believable and are not portrayed as gangsters and tramps not one obscene stereotype can be found here contrast that with the romance movies of toady exactly in closing if you love black cinema then you would do well to own a copy of this movie
<START> reasonably effective horror science fiction a la alien is fairly well done given its limited ambitions some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue when a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total eclipse
<START> i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til it's end even if i'm not really enjoying it i rarely feel like i wasted my time but this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible br br it wasn't scary in the least bit what is with the comic relief moments the dialog was tedious acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open like the birthday party br br the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done br br i am curious about other adaptation but until then i will stick to reading about the story
<START> this really is a film of two halves the first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys one a privileged and the other a down trodden in late 70s afghanistan before the invasion by the ussr works extremely well the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief br br the real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the as a man living in america ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see that of his boyhood friend br br once he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately even though he is not looking for him despite the chaos that has since consumed the country this enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make br br although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character's emotional journey of self discovery and healing unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted
<START> this is a delightful gem of a movie unfortunately pigeon holed as just for kids the plot revolves around a young man roy eberhardt newly arrived in southwest florida from the montana mountains trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school roy discovers a brother sister team trying to protect endangered burrowing owls at an illegal construction site look for carl the author of the book upon which this movie is based as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate headquarters writer director wil is also the clerk at the public records office where the intrepid teen detectives discover that the incriminating environmental impact report is missing luke wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines wilson is the bumbling police officer in his three wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren as officer dave he tries so hard to do well but usually ends up falling in the muck literally several times jimmy buffet is pretty low key as the tacitly supportive science teacher but young actors logan lerman roy brie larson beatrice the bear and cody mullet fingers are superb as the teens who finally put officer dave on the right track following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss i hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as i did just plain fun one small complaint though i hope all non realize that not everyone from florida is as surly to newcomers as depicted in this film we're really a friendly bunch just ask carl and jimmy buffet
<START> i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish direction is both heavy handed and cliched how much more cliched can you get than paris at night the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their to egon angst ridden self portraits yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good goddard and truffaut really are
<START> there are plenty of reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made for sure there are plenty of mistakes lackluster acting rather boring and cliched and at times paradoxical script and the stock b movie sound and special effects as noted there are plenty of glosses of plot making cave dwellers a tissue of fantasy film especially in comparison with the lord of the rings trilogy however this movie is not the worst movie ever most if not all including this review of these reviews are written by fans of mstk3 therefore many of these reviews are pretty much summaries of the mstk3 episode of cave dwellers br br in the episode joel tom servo and crow remark to the mad scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them of course loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it i have found this movie endearing not in a way that one finds forrest gump endearing but in the effort put into this movie by some the cast also this movie is laughable without its mstk3 treatment that is because cave dwellers does not take itself seriously and it is not trying to import into its viewers some sort of righteous theme for all of the monster puppets medieval hang gliding and continuity lapses this movie does not advertise to be any more that what it is a shallow depiction of a rather shallow genre br br likewise i can't bring myself to hate miles o'keeffe or lisa foster instead this hatred is for coleman francis tony jennifer lopez arch hall jr and so on br br
<START> h g had difficulties working in france after he had made le in 1943 which was produced by the german company and later judged by french as a piece of anti french propaganda louis jouvet an admirer of clouzot's work invited him to direct a thriller quai des where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in paris music hall without each other knowledge the seductive cabaret singer jenny lamoure suzy and her jealous piano husband maurice who is madly in love with her bertrand blier father of director bertrand blier trying to cover up without each other's knowledge what they believe to be their involvement in the murder enters tenacious policeman louis jouvet who is determined to discover the truth jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance his character his eagle like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable quai des witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of h g the fine director french hitchcock
<START> despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruise's attempt all the major players from the series were present talbot lestat armand pandora marius and a half dozen more albeit most of them in cameo marius lestat and were the main players and jesse of the also despite other reviews i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne rice's portrayal and ethos at least as i perceive it was pretty good as in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene the movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but i thought it was a nice supplement br br i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments and i found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision
<START> don't see this movie it's repulsive the start is indeed very good but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 about 11 dollars on the ticket peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest awful picture the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert lena nyman and br br hope you take my advise the picture is rubbish
<START> this is high gloss soft porn a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing sex they actually made sex boring sad to say because i defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was what this is is an excuse for kim bassinger to show off her great body and for mickey rourke to smirk a lot that's it rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and bassinger despite the great figure looks cheap more than beautiful br br kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color but the story is so weak no character development and no plot it's unable to compensate let's face it this movie was made for only reason to titillate male viewers on that level it probably succeeded if i recall it's why i gave it a look being a fan of bassinger's looks but i actually expected a story too br br those trying to pass this off as arty and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves
<START> i can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often i've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film i saw it the year it was released i was 19 i don't think there were a dozen people in that east village theater that night for years i thought we were the only ones who saw it nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as i had and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by rent it buy it or steal it a must see
<START> actually there was nothing funny about this monstrosity at all this movie was a complete abomination the absurdities in this movie almost made me want to vomit i think that the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their viewing audience they took a relatively decent series of movies i did say decent not good and totally trashed it by trying to put money in their pockets the making of airplane was a way for hollywood to make up for this crappy flick the worst part about it is that either nobody in 1979 realized the asinine events of the movie such as door popping off at some ungodly high altitude or patroni shooting a flair gun out the window at mach 2 to avoid a nuclear warhead what were they thinking were totally unrealistic or they just didn't care i think that it is the latter of the two the writers and director of this film if you want to call it that really tried to suck the airport dynasty dry with this crap
<START> sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes featurette than a grisly giallo don't torture a duckling 1972 is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror maestro lucio fulci in this one someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural southern italian village and typical for these gialli there are many suspects there's barbara bouchet patrizia looking more than you've ever seen her a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal florinda bolkan the local epileptic voodoo woman her witchcraft practicing beau giuseppe the local idiot the sweet faced priest his dour mother and on and on the film features some unusually violent set pieces including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard one of the most realistically bloody sequences that i've ever seen and a nifty when the killer is ultimately revealed the film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of still this giallo fascinates with its unusual rural backdrop unsettling child murders oddball characters and freaky score by riz ortolani the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be monte near the adriatic in southern italy at least that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits and while subtitling would've made this fine looking dvd work even better the american slang doesn't convince in this rural italian setting anchor bay is to be thanked for another job well done oh that title does eventually make perfect sense too
