<START> i love ben kingsley and tea leoni however this is easily the worst movie i have seen in 10 years and i see my share of movies a stinker this is a bad idea for a movie poorly executed nothing about it is funny credible or interesting i was looking for wit irony and genuine humor instead this looked like most of the cast members wandered on to the set to do tea leoni a favor it's too bad such acting talent was wasted on such hollowness don't bother i have to wonder what opinion the makers of this movie have of their audience to subject them to the idea of polish gangsters in buffalo ny sending a contract murderer to san francisco to become a mortuary assistant while attending aa meetings bill pullman should begin reading scripts before he agrees to be in a movie sad
<START> the only thing that makes this one watchable is corey's performance as the lunatic killer on the loose what remains is a most impossible tale of revenge and matrimonial discord during the walkie talkie scenes i had the feeling that cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device another interesting thing about this one is that alan hale the skipper from gilligan's island is not yet so fat and he can still lower his arms below his waist other than that there isn't much to recommend here
<START> lovely i just love the movie i want to see this movie because rupert is a fantastic actor his expressions are great spectacular the movie was excellent julie walters it was perfect too i think that rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love rupert have a beautiful smile a beautiful voice and a wonderful accent i think that the movie was great and was great see rupert in another thing but harry potter and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an oscar academy award there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway it does not matter but he is perfect brilliant and beautiful
<START> i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my art museum on occasion well more like half of the time i am unable to watch the films there i have systematically attempted to view each of the films that i have missed so far plagues and pleasures on the salton sea and who killed the electric car are the other films that i have had to watch this way the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is well theorized emphasis on this later but not as successful as plagues and pleasures but far superior to electric car br br the film's thesis the future of the american concept of suburban living it questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise so the film discusses the origin of the suburb and it's evolution until the early 2000s one theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants while several people may live together they do not know each other as we define the word this to me represents the strength of the film its appeal to actual human emotion we are able to understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their legitimacy this is also one of the reasons salton sea is such a wonderful documentary br br unfortunately suburbia loses its message in firebrand explanation in support of its central argument as those interviewed speak their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade but are given no scientific evidence professional reports statistics etc in support of this claim we are given little information as to how this date was calculated fortunately this was the only significant flaw that i was able to detect in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless another less important discrepancy i noticed was the liberal political bias which could some viewers however this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves the clips especially those from the 1950's seemed a tad unnecessary to me the film was no better with their presence and would have been more concise in their absence br br as i thought more of this film before composing this review i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that i'd recently viewed finally i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem they propose a village system where pockets of people would live together they posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas for instance what is incredible about this is that it's actually conceivable most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so thinking more about the film i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a favorable review br br while neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation the end of suburbia is a worthwhile investment of one's time it not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern people living in atlanta georgia or the triad region of north carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there
<START> as a genghis khan fan i was looking forward to this movie after devouring conn epic novels about genghis and reading up on loads of historic records i feel i know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie br br that turned out a deception this movie is practically made up from beginning to end there are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers that does not have to be a problem i like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie br br i would not recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject
<START> this takes place on fire island back in the 1970s a couple peter craig dudley and buddy j will deane are throwing a 4th of july party at their house unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests the rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between peter and buddy br br ok i'm a gay man but i was 8 back when this was made if this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s i'm glad i wasn't around from the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand this movie slides slowly into disaster there's a guru robert case who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance i wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first long speech there's the young kid danny who is there for his first time there's the lesbian couple who do nothing except one strips for no reason there's the leather queen worst of all is the effeminate man named jimmy jimmy foster we're introduced to him and his friend whose name i never got when they get a flat tire they basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix a flat i know some people find this funny but i found it offensive and pretty sad the party itself is full of people you would never want to know it's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people with the sole exception of dudley no one can act br br this may be valuable as a portrait of what fire island was like in the 1970s but it's pretty dull viewing this gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies
<START> i watched this movie and all i can say is this i am not a film student nor am i some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that i don't understand however if i were to do that with this film my thoughts would be br br yep he's on drugs and i can picture it now he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like hey wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while bounced to the ground and got up and walked away cackles or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath oh my god i'm cracking up just thinking about it dude we gotta make a movie about it and then he says to his friend as he's laughing oh and wouldn't it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it so to me this is what happens when some guy does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie should i have been doing lsd to understand what this guy was thinking so i could have had a laugh too because i have to tell you i wasn't laughing i was yawning and checking the time br br i think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical i had never heard of this director until i came to read the reviews which i did because i was mad that i lost that last 2 hrs or how ever long it was it felt like 12 hrs of my life and i can't ever get it back anyway i have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art what the heck is that so my point is sort of proved this guy is not all there he's a drug addict and his movie is evidence of such so please quit trying to find a deeper meaning to it if one really wants to understand everything in this movie go drop some lsd and sit back and relax then it might actually make sense br br it reminded me of the time i watched gus van sant's last days another movie i was mad about watching i cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one it seems like if the movie's director is totally off his rocker or if it's a french movie with sex and subtitles or if it's a cartoon it is going to get great reviews hands down anything else is boring and has already been done blah bring on the boring please
<START> how many times must i write the words boring and not funny on this page until i get to ten lines george is about original an actor as from the little rascals although that is probably a slight to how many times do i have sneak into these overpaid actors crappy films before i will learn that there is but one law in the movie industry take the money and make a movie even if it is crap they spend millions making this movie but can't take a few moments to watch the end result and renee should stop taking the illegal drugs she is on and seek medical help for the facial problems she is sporting at least i hope its drugs as she is quite unattractive whilst talking out the side of her mouth this movie was neither funny nor dramatic and these hacks should just stop making crap like this george and renee you should be ashamed of yourselves and stop being stop stinking greedy
<START> after a few misfires we are still waiting for the french horror movie that the critics will certainly vilify but will launch a new trend not this time doug headline can't be accused of not being in the genre he is editor of a high class fantasy imprint has worked for legendary magazine but why a scenario that uses every clichÃ© in the book except maybe the odious comic relief why make it so predictable even the nods towards argento fails flat it's not even an euro teen movie like the german anatomy much better just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features lots of plot holes the whole celtic aspect is barely touched and after a painfully predictable the screenplay offers us a boring endless chase in a subterranean which seems bigger than parisian catacombs i really wanted to love this film really but even a mother would not oh and writer was supposed to have a cameo but i vainly looked for him
<START> this is my all time favorite looney tunes cartoon it's a common plot daffy duck tries to convince elmer fudd that it is really rabbit season and shoot bugs but your can never outsmart that rabbit in addition to usual cartoon comedy this cartoon is supported by great word play that will keep you rolling on the floor
<START> if you are dating a girl that is into br br many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling you get from this movie while watching it and immediately after is enough alone to sit through it all but some things really bothered me about this film that i cant really put my finger on br br i definitely think that this movie is one that any art student or photography student should see b c of the camera style and graininess that ive never seen but that is just it it looks like an art student made it and the plot if there is any is so jumpy that you really need to be on a lot of drugs to get just what is going on
<START> and now for another point of view i didn't like it i didn't finish it in fact i know that unforgiven is ranked by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood one of the icons of american cinema i know that it won a bunch of oscars still i didn't like it i don't like westerns and that's clearly a matter of taste but i also don't admire eastwood's acting he is not and never has been a leading man he is no burt lancaster no paul newman no john wayne in this film alone he is dwarfed by richard harris and gene hackman they are both actors no eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys here he plays a retired tough guy when i see him on screen i see a man at his acting then there's the anti western western plot it is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values a respect for the role of women blacks native americans and single parents a disrespect for violence and drinking the wholesomeness that comes with marriage including interracial marriage and small adorable children into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted at least in these ways by promoting those values the movie comes across as mannered if not preachy then there are the hoary movie stereotypes prostitutes with hearts of gold the kid who can't shoot straight the city slicker new to the wild west the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords finally there is the pacing of eastwood's direction i gave up after an hour eastwood was still riding north chatting with morgan freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion it was way too slow somebody had to find these elements uncompelling i am afraid it was me
<START> better than it has any right to be this movie died a quick and painful death at the american box office at times sophomoric at others bitingly satirical and witty jekyll and hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times laden with drug and sexual humor reminding one at one time or another of everything from the woody allen of everything you always wanted to know about sex to the mel brooks of the producers saturday night live to monty python carlin to cheech and chong watch it listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious
<START> this movie was so predictable and poorly acted i really can't recommend it to anyone not even for unintentional laughs it is just plain bad it is pure tv movie hell the cast doesn't seem all that bad but they act terribly just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual like porn
<START> the positives it's shot pretty well has some interesting peripheral characters likable main character albeit weak br br the bad plot story editing characters wasted jessica alba br br i'm a fan of sappy movies but this movie is cringe bad i don't understand how anyone can hand over 12m to this guy and before i go any further i just want to say that i don't dislike jessica alba i really wanted to like her in this film however jessica alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable she has absolutely no screen presence in this movie and she ruins every scene she's in needless to say the romance does not come off as believable not even a tiny bit br br all i saw throughout was the actors flapping their wings trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were given but sadly all this movie does is sink there is no emotional connection no emotional conflict and nothing is gained it's a pretty empty movie
