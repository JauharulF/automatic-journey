<START> i saw this years ago and it's entertaining but not profound the basic story is of a young man who dreams of though he's not sure where it is or even if it really exists br br spoilers follow he finally visits it gets transformed to a creature by being bitten by another one then he has to help the other members of the because they're being attacked by canadians save for the accents they all act like good ol' boys not much in tune with the canadian psyche eh someone observed for monsters or substitute jews and for the canadians humans substitute nazis and you're supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans well maybe br br one major objection i had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather ramshackle and frankly dirty this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements one would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of decor br br the storyline is a tad thin but that's to introduce characters but it's entertaining enough for a repeat view
<START> i'm not a big fan of movie musicals annie was a stage show i loved but the movie was a flop the phantom of the opera movies and i believe there were three failed to match the weber staging but i loved this the dvd will take a place of honour among my keepers even though it's a movie adaptation it somehow captures the flavour and the atmosphere of live theatre bette midler always a treat is just exceptional in this role there's great music lots of laughs and even a tear or two i've seen most of the big musicals of the eighties and nineties somehow i missed this one so there's no comparison to make but if it gets revived i shall be first in line for tickets but this movie is so good i'll be in the odd position of wondering if the stage production will measure up to the movie
<START> i am trying to find somewhere to purchase a dvd vhs copy of the movie isn't it shocking i was 7 years old when i saw this movie and i lived in the town where it was filmed a couple of items from my family were used in the movie as props and a couple of my friend's homes were used in a couple of the scenes the filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community i have only seen the film once originally and i would like to get a copy so now i can show my family the film i have done extensive searches online with not luck and i was wondering if anyone would have any ideas on trying to get a copy of this movie
<START> the core meets crack in the world 1965 made for tv the acting is stock the suspense predictable once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from the core basically the manned drilling machine you end up with the plot of crack in the world crack was a truly excellent movie starring dana andrews his team of scientists working in south africa drilled down to the crust and punched through with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of energy one of his subordinates also a brilliant scientist disagrees he believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole but will instead form cracks in the crust possible spoiler he is right in order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack br br although i have placed a spoiler warning i don't know if i really spoiled anything for either movie and since crack in the world is only available in very rare vhs format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter blast works is probably academic br br all in all i rate descent' just below average
<START> alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it the title didn't even fit the it after the first ten minutes the wind didn't have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie the acting was sub par and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories br br as far as horror movies go this shouldn't even be classified as one this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere i hate to be so harsh but i felt i want the time i spent watching this movie back hopefully there will not be a follow up to this this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing
<START> it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly's home studio mgm to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films cover girl also became rita hayworth's signature film for the gis and their pinup fantasies during world war ii br br kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil silvers the comic of course kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there br br hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto kruger when it turns out that kruger had loved and lost hayworth's grandmother in some flashback sequences from the gaslight era hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young kruger you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead susan hayward br br broadway producer lee bowman also is attracted to hayward but he's not interested in nostalgia he wants her for his ziegfeld follies revue and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film it's nicely done in follies style br br hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by jerome kern and ira gershwin hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john when i say sing as everyone knows rita mouths words singing here is done by nan wynn br br the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers jerome kern ever wrote it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september long ago and far away was nominated for best song but lost to swinging on a star br br what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number harry cohn decided to do what louis b mayer had refused at mgm to give kelly creative control of his own material kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career in it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate br br in fact after one more loan out film christmas holiday at universal louis b mayer never loaned out gene kelly for the rest of the time he was at mgm and he did get creative control from then on br br with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and rita's red hair and gene kelly's boundless creativity cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so
<START> was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming this there was a hole in the plot so big nothing could have filled it up from the first scene when the co star is late for dinner was there any doubt where he was and what he had just done the suspense was over from there now it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved i must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours wondering how dumb the screenwriter the director slater molly parker and stephen rea could be not to at least explain how our murderer who was not a lawyer or a policeman could go into a locked cell at a jail kill his second victim and tie him up from a noose to make it look like suicide i kept wondering if i had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how that happened if someone can explain it to me please do and then why for god's sake did he kill the third victim nothing made sense and yet someone thought this film was worthy to be an official selection at a film festival perhaps it was a comedy and i failed to laugh
<START> this junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber the film makers took the alamo section out of the book made it into a movie and said it was based on the book hah wonder what they did to induce mr michener to endorse this piece of fluff it was just another davy crockett flintlock rifle santa ana 13 days of glory collection of poppycock i almost started rooting for the mexicans just to get the damn thing to end and what was that scene where stacey keach was trying to get james bowie to let him look at the knife the sexual innuendos he used were juvenile and unnecessary they could have used the film they wasted on that silliness to put in some real dialogue this show was an embarrassment to hollywood or can those clowns be embarrassed
<START> like most people out there who have watched james bond 007 movies most people never knew that thunderball was originally the first 007 movie to be released but after ian fleming wrote the story with kevin and jack the 2 other authors took ian fleming to court and won the case providing evidence that ian fleming took the ideas of spectre special executive in terrorism revenge extortion so rather than making thunderball they fleming broccoli went on to make dr no br br this movie had the best of the best from getting sean connery to come back one more time he was paid over 5 000 000 for irvin kershner and sean connery had problems on the set that much is true but overall this movie was up there i think with thunderball licence to kill dr no those are my favorite from the bond series david dryer was hired for special photographic effects he was working at the time on bladerunner before never say never again the 100 million dollar yacht makes the disco look like a canoe this movie starred the best villian in a bond movie just behind dr no klaus maria held together this neurotic business like calm manner with a little wit to his authority over bond barbara carrera was excellent as blush br br the music was better than every score that didnt contain john barry doing the score music in most bond films michel legrand is not big in the usa compared to over in europe he has played with miles davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years its a little bland at times but the 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the movie never say never again is so cool i like it more than the original br br 007 is back one more time br br timothy dalton explained it right i thought you cant relate to a superman or a superhero he or she has to be human and have feelings he was by far the best serious true to version of bond but sean connery proves he can still do the role that made him and others to follow i bet at 75 now he could still pull off a villian role in a 007 movie if one ever surfaces br br
<START> citizen kane the godfather part ii martin's dolemite this is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity rudy ray moore in a role that transcends academy awards stars as dolemite the baddest cat in the universe he clearly does not take any jive from no turkey i myself am unfortunately a turkey and proves it with his powers of rapping pimping and karate chopping this is blaxploitation at its absolute finest a shining example of the genre with its low budget continuity errors and hatred for rat soup eating expletive expletive the true godfather of rap not this new ali nonsense moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970's and thats saying something this one is highly recommended folks if not for the one liners alone
<START> i seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out but had avoided seeing it throughout the years i wish i'd waited longer maybe this movie was funny in 1988 i don't know i was younger then but it didn't seem like the world was that different michelle pfeiffer lovely as she is is never convincing mercedes ruehl not only chews scenery but stuffs it in her cheeks like a to save for later dean stockwell is about as convincing as a mob boss as james gandolfini would be as principal dancer for the bolshoi and matthew modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of delayed puberty i've ever seen all in all it's not bad enough to make you want to pluck out your eyes with a melon baller but it's not far off
<START> let me depart from many comments i've read here and say that this film ranks as one of the five best bonds along with on her majesty's secret service from russia with love licence to kill and for your eyes only the only time roger moore actually played the role of bond instead of around of course sean connery pulls the whole thing together as co writer co producer and in his best performance since from russia with love he is fit energetic and obviously enjoying himself his acting is mature confident and laced with the right amount of humour this is in contrast to his mechanical performance in thunderball his sleepwalking through you only live twice and his paunchy romp through that cartoon known as diamonds are forever br br this is an imaginative reworking of thunderball without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot this cast is far superior as well klaus maria brandauer brings his unique style to the role of largo without relying on an eyepatch spectre ring or a boring uniform kim basinger is athletic and lovely barbara carrera is dynamic and for once we have a great felix in bernie casey the depictions of m and q are original and the addition of the bumbling agent small fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick br br director irvin kershner makes good use of his locations the bahamas and the french riviera without losing sight of his actors although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace unlike thunderball which even its director terence young did not like obviously fans will miss the gun barrel trademark and the 007 theme music but they are after all owned by eon productions br br michel legrand may not have composed the most memorable score but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive not surprisingly his best moments are in the south of france with his french love song at the health spa being particularly attractive and tell me how many really remember the music for moonraker i personally would rather forget man with the golden gun and a view to a kill br br the eon folks can sneer at this film if they like yes octopussy made more money at least connery's mature 007 didn't swing through the jungle emitting a tarzan yell he did not frolic with a bengal tiger nor did he fight off indian snake charmers with a tennis racket despite eon's desperate efforts to stop this production kevin and the late jack schwartzman put together a fine film one that i think ian fleming would have appreciated br br if however you would rather see james bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf engage in another tiresome struggle with jaws jump into bed with grace jones or lead a slapstick chase through san francisco this is not the film for you
<START> tim burton the man behind the original batman film and beetlejuice brings the world the sequel to batman that exceeds the original in more ways than one firstly michelle pfeiffer and danny de vito are a great mix of batmans enemies the dark deadly and sexy catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original the sets are stunning and immaculate gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another the only thing that gives it a bad name is its script which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while tim burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm beats all the superman films and the other batman films by a mile though in terms of realisation the new batman begins has a bite where this one lacks but burton is a more original director than nolan
<START> this movie is the very worst that i have ever seen you might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time but if you haven't seen this one you don't know how terrible a movie can be but wait there's worse news the studio will soon this masterpiece i'm being ironic for all to see the only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects the acting the direction and the production bill rebane the poor man's ed wood not that there is a rich man's ed wood i like ed wood's movies though manages to keep things moving at a snail's pace throughout this film it opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot a sorry couldn't help it by a pair of unlikable hunters who are killed by the parent this causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go on a bigfoot hunting jihad this is pretty much it for the plot nothing even remotely interesting happens and we the viewers are never able to care about any of the characters if one is interested in the films of rebane i would recommend almost any other over this however as i said it will soon be rereleased by troma in order to bore a new generation of filmgoers
<START> this is fantastic everything from the score to when the final credits role this movie is a masterpiece it's genuinely creepy and its effectively hysterical setting is enough to give anyone the creeps it is apparent that the movie was not rushed and that david schmoeller who would later work with fullmoon on the puppet master series had a clear and concise image of what he is trying to direct the professional aspect of the movie is astonishing considering it's relatively low budget it relies on scares without effects mainly due to budget restrictions but still creates a tension filled atmosphere br br stephen king stated that this was one of his favorite movies and i seriously cannot blame him it's one of my favorite horror movies and always will be this is my favorite fullmoon movie and has been ever since i first purchased a good few years ago br br money well spent i own both vhs and dvd versions br br 10 10
