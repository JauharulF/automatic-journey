<START> this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b its title promises far more than the film delivers it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality the people are agreeable even the obligatory flamboyant type the lead kevin mckidd overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all simon callow playing a horny straight is always worth watching and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie however the rubbish about his men's group meditations or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non stop inaction the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack let the thing run you won't miss anything hugo weaving's character is superfluous he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all the outcome of that sequence isn't explained and hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story the movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits this is an interlude with no structure
<START> although allegedly autobiographical this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology resulting in a flat fragmented characterization as well as into larger scale historical processes and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary iran remained unfulfilled instead i found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded islamic villains replaced each other taunting torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle class iranian whose western cultural sympathies were patent and whose the movie quite blatantly seeks the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass media market as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk ideologies i e a crowd pleaser br br what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation genuinely minimalistic imagery which nevertheless always kept the screen rich expressive and unambiguous no small for which i do give it some stars
<START> symbolism galore great tunes this film crushed their soon to be no more target audience's expectations these monkees and the naturally selected members of the group were witnessing a subtle yet in your face kiss goodbye to each other the message rings true today the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of are the next generations own disappointments there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains the film can be frustrating at times because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the american way of life a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of head and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday american life but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness the final scene similar to don daring of the caged tiger to exit for battle represents just how delusional and impossible most dreams are
<START> after 10 years it is finally save to say that our belgian action star is back again i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death which makes it his best movie in 10 years okay it is not like his highlight years as timecop universal soldier sudden death or even his best effort to date hard target one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo the action is good the story is exciting the dialogue is quite funny this one is better than expected the bad guys are awesome like in hard target and the fight scenes are old school real fans know what to expect i must say i gave up on him but van damme is finally back more please
<START> i just watched national lampoon's christmas vacation 2 on dvd hoping to see something at least close to the original great holiday comedy 'christmas vacation' i saw nothing of the kind you can tell right from the start that this movie just wasn't going to measure up it's too bad it has a title that links it to the original christmas vacation it's really kind of sad the film can't stand on it's own merits i think too many people will view this film on the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy other than the title there is very little connecting the movie to the original 'christmas vacation' and even less of a connection to christmas at all the comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor children might find some humor here but most adults would only get a chuckle here and there this movie is a flop don't waste your time with it
<START> this movie is a picture perfect action drama and thriller every scene has you sucked in i watched this movie and was amazed by how many talented actors were in the movie damian especially was great he played his role perfectly the story was made for these actors the characters make the movie so realistic this movie very simply gets an a plus from me definitely watch this film it compares with scarface but has a more in depth story this movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life but it also gives you the characters emotions and at the end you really feel for the main character watch this film
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> i purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store as they cleared out their tapes in favour of dvds i doubt they'll be replacing this one somehow br br i couldn't say that it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen but it's very dull no real cannibal scenes me me lai is not naked enough of the time only about 4 or 5 times and she's not the thai goddess that i expected either so two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out br br there is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing a great fight between a and a large snake gets quite bloody animal torture as well some of which is real and some fake thankfully the fake is somewhat funny but the real is just a little sickening br br generally speaking it's a 70s film overly long under developed not as deep as it would have liked to have been but it's something different right one and a half stars
<START> good lord how this ended up in our dvd player i'll never know my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow nevermind it's a couple of years old and in danish i think she kept looking for the english soundtrack br br all in all the film wasn't bad good production values better performances and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for tidy dark humored fare from across the sea the ending will make you chuckle in fact the whole film will incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while without spoiling the plot the film's title and dvd jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going
<START> if you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like i was the book was great and i was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well however i felt like i was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like the movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense i think both diane lane and richard gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other the book was true love story and i think this movie could of been a lot better
<START> my mother forced me to watch this movie with her she apparently will watch anything with a vampire counsel in it i was bored throughout br br at different points underworld rise of the is reminiscent of spartacus battle for the planet of the apes the passion of the christ and mandingo what it reminds me most of are those italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteen sixties not the good ones that spend an inordinate amount of time showing greek or roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover usually the despots daughter to do something br br this film was in desperate need of some color and suspense the characters were pretty two dimensional br br the sets looked as if they were constructed entirely of pewter i wonder how many civil war chess sets were melted down to make this movie br br all those wearing fishnet stockings on your arms and black lipstick feel free to click no
<START> was the last book to feature miss marple written by agatha christie the official final case 'sleeping murder' was written in the forties and i've always had a very soft spot for it i loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent bbc adaptation with joan terrific as ever as miss marple br br on the whole it is very faithful to the book a few characters are dropped the first new murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are introduced personally i felt that the added character of lionel peel was unnecessary and rather irritating tour guide madge was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing it's largely because of lionel that i don't award 10 out of 10 the other characters are beautifully done especially helen cherry as a dignified miss temple and all of the three weird sisters but particularly margaret who gives a towering performance as she threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it the female bodyguards are good value too and the episode contains one of my favourite lines 'an ' br br this is another relatively early bbc marple that looks wonderful and is has a gloriously nostalgic feel to it highly recommended
<START> two teenagers in the north east of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team they go through a series of comic misadventures but come up smiling in the end br br the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light hearted moments however the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes the two heroes have no problems with lying cheating and stealing their adversaries are a callous teacher a pantomime villain of a father a psychotic skinhead and a well meaning but incompetent social worker the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death there are no likable characters and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt local actors tim healy and kevin both play against type as baddies but the writing and direction of their characters are so one dimensional that they have no more than novelty value br br chris beattie and greg give good performances in the two young leads however they are miscast because they have the wrong accent to anyone from the north east it is obvious that they both come from the durham area and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of newcastle as a geordie myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same take the phrase let the poor lad speak we say let the lad while they say lad with two distinctly different vowel sounds this discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in football ground where the two lads are trying to disguise the newcastle accents they don't have and pretend that they come from which they clearly do in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nit picking however the film's bleak tone makes it clear that writer director mark herman is aiming for gritty realism that means near enough is actually way off br br i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film and instead found tired old clichÃ©s is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers and in telling us it is herman should have known he would cause offence it's interesting to compare the film with the same director's little voice also largely downbeat and populated by one dimensional characters little voice at least has a talented heroine and doesn't wallow in misery to the same extent i've heard belter ranked alongside this year's billy elliot but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life affirming experience br br incidentally i may be just too old but having lived on for 42 years i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression purely belter
<START> i was at a friends house for thanksgiving and watched a dvd of the movie eddie monroe i've been a fan of indie films for almost 20 years i loved the brothers and was impressed how good this movie is my friend who works at sound told us that this movie was shot on super 16 the photography was so good it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot furthermore the music combined with fred carpenter's direction was art the storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching very cool the acting by the entire cast was good especially the actor who played uncle benny he was amazing this film was a nice holiday treat and i was delighted to be one of the first to view a movie that many will be seeing in the future
<START> you the living ok i think i am an intelligent educated liberal and really into films i really like and have a great sense of humour i was under the impression this was a bleakly painful comedy they got paid for making this petrol was used electricity burnt food was consumed sets built why i blame the current state of the world on this film and all those people associated with it i will even include us the viewing public we are all to blame and deserve whatever coming its not funny not much happens everyone it seems is bored or boring there are no conversations communication is minimal there is no plot as far as i am aware i have in fact just lost 89 point something minutes of my life i will never ever get that time back the only message i have come away with is perhaps life is too short to sit around watching movies of people doing not much and then you die
