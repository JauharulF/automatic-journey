<START> chi painted fire recounts the life of korean painter jang ub amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century korea br br however the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society br br jang ub is played masterfully as a complex character who changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul this characterization mirrors the young eager artist that finds it more and more difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire out via drink erections and desire br br although this character development proceeds overall gradually through the film the emotional complexity of jang is still played in a constantly oscillating manner building to the films' finale interestingly the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as scenes seamlessly transition from one time and location to another without any conventional to the audience that such a scene change will occur for example many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location br br the visual scenery of the film is presented beautifully and also from stark and perhaps bleak black and white scenery to more colorful and alive environments that again parallel the paintings of jang either in simple black ink on white paper or with color added rainbows of color enter the film at points as the artist observes nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings br br the theme of an artist's individual desire to create versus the expectations and demands of society arises in the film through various points including class distinction the domination of government over the artist the accepted norms of the artistic elite and the base desires of the common masses instead of creating his own completely original works jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces of other artists throughout east asia the question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic merit br br i wish that i was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly grasp how they tied into the story but beyond any comparison to the current role of korean government in artistic expression and or censorship i cannot comment br br overall an extremely well acted film and the cinematography is often breathtaking a great film to see and then ponder over
<START> the best independent film of 2001 i went to see the wind at the recommendation of friends who caught it at dances with films festival in la last summer it's a great scary well made film the score was amazing can't wait to see his next movie
<START> the whole town of is afraid because they lynched bret dixon's brother and he is coming back for revenge at least that's what they think br br a great johnny and a very interesting early mario star in this italo western obviously filmed in the alps br br bret dixon is coming back to to investigate why his brother was lynched he is a loner and gunslinger par excellance everybody is afraid of him the mexican bandits fighting the that took their land as well as the decent citizens that lynched brother they lynched him because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to dallas to the safety of the bank there but this is is only half the truth as we find out in the course of this psychologically interesting western br br but beware it's kind of a depressing movie as everybody turns out to be guilty somehow and definitely everybody is bad to the bone br br still i enjoyed it very much and gave it an 8 10 strange that only less than 5 people voted for this movie as of january 12th 2002
<START> this was supposed to be set in the bible belt of northern ireland well as someone who grew up there and was a child in the era depicted in the film it just didn't ring true the accents were all over the place anything but county derry the church didn't resemble any i have ever seen the church of god is a pentecostal denomination but the one in the film was certainly not pentecostal the elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the church of ireland anglican and no c of i would call itself the church of god the minister was often addressed as reverend they may do that in some parts of the world but i never heard it when i lived in that area ministers were addressed as mr br br this film was very badly researched and cast fairly typical of irish cinema annoying a film can have a great plot but if it doesn't look authentic it is rubbish
<START> this movie states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those that ignore this have blinders on one can argue whether this is true or not but even if you accept this as true the movie's ending either a disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or b forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted br br that the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film br br so what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film there are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially spacey olin martin donovan and ann it's a shame that they weren't supported by a better writer director
<START> i am very disappointed because i expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews the script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too the director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense it tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller therefore i had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me i was always asking what kind of movie i am watching then i didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry the end is also very disappointing i cannot understand how jodie foster could have been nominated for the golden globe in this worst role of her life jodie therefore i liked very much panic room or flight plan this is definitely one of the worst i have ever seen 4 10
<START> i'd never heard of zero budget auteur neil johnson before seeing on dvd at hollywood video a few minutes into the movie i realize this isn't a bad thing like many straight to video sci fi movies this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci fi concepts that fail to create a story br br viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter to me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with ugly visuals and zero character emphasis some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it's seemingly new age messages hook line and sinker these favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like battlefield earth was a brilliant movie or that is just as good as coke br br those who were lured in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting in small doses spaced with long blocks of people not talking rotten computer animated effects in extra large doses and irritating talking computers what you won't get is excitement emotional stimulation memorable dialogue or a good story br br is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it real science fiction hell real film making is about characters and their dialogue not special effects and dull predictions this is right down there with similar direct to video sci fi like one and recon 2022 if the boredom of strange horizons and alien visitor is something you seek out by all means watch the crap out of this if you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares you're better off with a real movie
<START> this movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of the chronicles of narnia shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written it is well executed acted and directed the cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but i'm sure it was intended to be so the screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie through out the movie i found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen this is a wonderful piece of cinema and i can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews fair warning though this was a 6 tissue movie for me very touching very heartfelt performances
<START> i've enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good it's really good but this episode that features mr echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself tapping the fast forward button this episode stood out so far as by far the worst in fact the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent i find myself often wondering how many writers they are using br br i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the sub par actors in the series to die off
<START> a stunningly well made film with exceptional acting directing writing and photography br br a newlywed finds married life not what she expected and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society together with her sister in law she makes some radical departures from conventional roles and mores
<START> as you can see i loved the book so much i use the title for my internet alias and have for over 15 years okay so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name character limit for the bbs at the time but what could i do if anyone every finds this movie i would absolutely love to see it janet mcteer is great in everything else i've seen of hers i think she would have made a great and it even features early clive owen from before chancer a great series itself what's not to love i hope the powers that be wise up and make this available on dvd soon with some of the true dredge they pout out it's about time well executed productions make it on the market too
<START> the violent men marked the finest collaboration of rudolph with glenn ford in an intensely satisfying drama of rugged primitive justiceÂ br br ford is john parrish a former cavalry captain who is itching to get married and start a new his fiancÃ©e caroline vail may wynn is desperate to move east and to see him selling his spread to lee edward g robinson br br parrish is not even much of a but he do understand that there is something big building up in the in the army they used to call it pressure ' first cole brian keith comes back from texas to help his brother run then a tough kid with a fancy gun richard jaeckel shows up on the then all the small ranchers are forced out getting the same kind of parrish saw himself either running like they did or stand and br br but can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley br br all that grass and sand ever meant to the ex confederate army officer the past three it was a place to regain his out of habit of taking advice parrish affirms what happen in this valley is no concern of mine and much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers who pressure him to stay on he decides to accept offer to fulfill the promise he made to his br br when lee's younger brother cole made the wrong move trying to push parrish make up his mind by lynching one of his ranch hands parrish got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the privilege of being let br br brian keith plays the traitorous brother who's behind the killing he dreams to have position and respect in running one day br br lee's ambitious wife martha barbara stanwyck secretly hates herself and her husbandÂ stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who can't bear the touch of her husband's br br edward g robinson is good enough as the crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife unaware that she is having an affair with his younger br br dianne foster is too sensitive as the adult daughter well aware of her mother's br br the violent men uses the wide screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action drama making it a perfect example of the genre's most enduring
<START> this ranks as my favorite movie of all time it's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever the fact that it was a sendup of star wars just made it all the better br br i love slapstick think of this as the marx brothers or the three stooges meet star wars the writing is hilarious the effects are a hoot the free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of left field i almost wet my pants when the wookie monster accosted the princess br br space balls was a much longer movie but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it and i felt sort of ripped off afterwards like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler hardware wars despite being only about 15 minutes long would be worth paying a feature price imo
<START> don't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute charming little movie madonna is great in this clever comedy i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it everyone always enjoyed it it's actually a great movie for kids too
