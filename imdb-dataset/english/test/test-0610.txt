<START> i always had this concept that korean movies were all about comedy and drama but christmas in autumn has changed my point of view this movie is so simple it have any melodramatic scenes or over the top comedy scenes not a single scene where the actors cry out loud not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss not even a simple kiss and yet this movie is able to reach it's viewers in ways that i dint know existed the ending of the movie left me speechless i dint even cry but my eyes were red hot this movie left me a feeling i can hardly describe in words br br i don't think i can recommend this movie to everyone but i do recommend this movie to people who want to watch real cinema 9 4 10
<START> in a morocco completely invaded by europeans and americans in the beginning of the twentieth century the moroccan leader mohammed el the magnificent sean connery kidnaps the american eden candice bergen her son and her daughter his intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them to fight against the corrupt sultan of marc in times of election the american president theodore roosevelt brian keith agrees with the proposal however is betrayed and eden helps him to be released from the prison with the american soldiers i do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries but the lion and the wind' is indeed a great adventure the action scenes are very realistic candice bergen the most beautiful american actress in the is wonderful performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie soldier sean connery is perfect as usual as an honest and nationalist religious leader brian keith is great as the american president i do not know much about the morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment in brazil it is only available on vhs my vote is eight br br title brazil o vento e o the lion and the wind' br br
<START> i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country houston dallas austin san antonio etc they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers cowboy hat talks with a drawl has zero fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to either the saloon or his next hunting trip rodeo skeet shooting or country music concert i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police truck anywhere in texas br br the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high brow entertainment at least knightrider had the talking car
<START> maybe in its day this movie was special but five decades later it seems quaint just another cinematic relic of the dreadful 1950s stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three female gold diggers who set up shop in a manhattan penthouse in an effort to attract wealthy husbands br br i don't mind the shallow theme but the film's premise is lame and the execution is worse it's a romantic comedy but i found little to laugh at the plot point about an extremely bimbo is about the only clever element of the story overall dialogue is flat and so too is the delivery and the script structure is disconcerting the plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies it's as if the writer couldn't quite blend the ensemble roles the result is a plot that seems choppy br br marilyn monroe was a good choice for her role but lauren bacall was too old for the role she played and betty grable with her squeaky voice and awful hairdo was just plain annoying br br color cinematography is conventional but there were lots of shots using rear screen projection contributing to a dated look the visuals are made even worse by costumes that reek of cheesy 1950's glamour they are just awful viewers must endure a fashion show a plot point that amplifies how the film's director was smitten by those trashy glad rags br br and then there is that orchestra in what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some dreary sounding tune at first i thought i was watching the introduction to coming attractions but no it's actually part of the film and the orchestra plays on and on and on it has nothing absolutely nothing whatever to do with the story what were they thinking br br i enjoyed marilyn monroe with her breathy voice as she bimbos her way through the plot but the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles dumped that orchestra enhanced the comedy dialogue and downplayed those gaudy cheesy costumes
<START> this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed
<START> this movie took me by surprise i first saw it more than 10 years ago and it stays with me still it's got it's just plain boring points and i personally would have ended it differently this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others the acting is fantastic the cast and director do an amazing job with the script and anyone who likes 'different' movies who has the patience to sit and say what the hell is this and allow themselves to be drawn in should give this film a chance if you just want alan rickman to be goofy or to see things explode this is not the movie for you
<START> well i had the chance to view this film the other day i didn't know what to expect as i never saw the trailer and such but what i did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to see br br i wish i could give it this film a 0 rating the first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene i wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done the actors didn't have any direction there was no real story i read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc but really why should we expose children to this type of film its got poor humor rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80 of its time i am sure a few people in hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs br br also how can 39 people give this movie a 10 i mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company this movie should average at 1 5 10 instead of its current 2 3 10 due to the people that ranked it 10 truly sad
<START> i was actually around 13 years old camping near the mccloud river near when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down the river a little trivia the scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river and if the stunt man missed the netting there was 20 foot waterfall about 1 4 mile down farther br br anyway i watched it at the time and didn't get it it wasn't until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it it's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again
<START> jimmy heath ledger is given a simple job by bryan brown a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone jimmy rings to tell him the problem but he doesn't want to hear it and his boys try their best to locate jimmy meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him so now jimmy goes into hiding to organise a bank robbery to get money back also throughout this mess he meets the innocently sweet alex rose byrne and together they're in for one hell of a ride through king cross br br two hands is simply an engrossing pick me up film that's brisk exhilarating and incredibly fresh what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in your face what how's that fresh you ask well because it takes us into the underworld where the australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs flip flops and shorts done up cars and a can of beer in the and don't forgot the australian sense of humour dry and sarcastic you can say it owes a lot to the likes of pulp fiction goodfellas a fave of mine and lock stock and two smoking barrels for its inspiration but for me it still stands on its own the film has real mixture of light hearted moments but also a mean streak to it with some unexpected shocks and black humour that can actually be disturbing you just don't know what's coming and it has a nice touch of snappy irony especially the ending and great timing with its humour one scene involving a bank robbery will have you in stitches i guarantee you the plot's outline is really a coming to age story or about the road not taken with a punching love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it off most of the sub plots were cleverly constructed and well maybe it could've gone without the supernatural element involving jimmy's dead brother but in the overall context the diverse plot seems to all click together intense natural and crisp dialogue filled the outrageously colourful script with quick jabs of aussie slang twang i'm fair br br what truly made the film was that of bryan brown's performance of he just gave his character such a deviously charismatic nasty persona that when he wasn't on screen his presence was still felt he gave his character two sides one being a prick but the other side is such a good bloke a young rose byrne glows with her nervously sweet quirky character alex she looked gorgeous and added a bubbly personality then you got heath ledger who the buck as the naive jimmy great supporting cast involved with the likes of susie porter tom long david field steve and steve le marquand such raw performances are achieved and from that you get riveting fun and believable characters pumping rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with the likes of and alex lloyd provide a cool vibe also being shot on location in king cross really helped it stick out by holding a life of its own and showing the australian way of life gliding camera tricks captured the city's backdrop superbly especially the piercing nightlife this was a film that when it ended i was totally satisfied with what i got overall a slickly paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do a fun clever and crazy roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement br br i say it's a successful aussie take on lock stock and two smoking barrels by director writer gregor jordan in his debut film if you come across it don't hesitate to it give it a go
<START> i saw that the foreigner was ranked in the bottom 100 movie listings here on imdb so i wasn't expecting much when i tuned into it on the usa channel a week back but i did have hopes belly of the beast which aired a month ago was a mess but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout so i thought that this movie might have some of the same br br alas this movie fails the standards of basic watch ability in almost every way the screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a john lecarre novel and a richard ludlum movie but done by people with none of those worthy writers' talent for plot and characterization instead what we got is a glum mean spirited nihilistic cryptic nest of muddled motives tangled alliances and back shootings and chest shootings and bombings and this carries over to the directorial style which relies on hackneyed shot slow shots every 10 seconds along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts these filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when mtv directors used them for videos and the director works them like a punch press hoping to inject some weird art house techno thriller coolness into the proceedings br br segal himself is just awful in this he spends the entire film talking in a hoarse throaty half whisper and alternating between two expressions looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose or looking constipated and he's so chunky and vain about it that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera i understand that it's hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages although denzel washington and paul newman never seemed to have that problem but you deal with it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes br br so i can't really tell what's going on and the movie doesn't give me a reason to care about what's going on and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing not a recipe for a good movie experience br br oddly most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking in fact if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasn't a close up of seagal you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lighting colors and composition and by how beautiful the eastern european settings are but dressing up a rotten egg as a egg can't make it edible and the proceedings are rotten at heart br br there are 'cool' movies like versus and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies like underworld and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers like the bourne identity and its remake with matt damon and then there is this thing which can't make up its mind what it wants to be pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no guts or soul br br this is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget so you can't really put it in the same class as manos killer shrews or hobgoblins but i'd rather watch all three of those movies back to back several times than watch the foreigner again even once
<START> this film is a perfect example of how to take a fascinating subject come up with 25 minutes of substantive material and stretch it into a six hour borefest resembling the shape a documentary might take if fox news decided to make one even the participants in this obnoxiously obstreperous film can't conceal their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where people take a stand and work to make a better world if only the creators had spoken with ken burns for 5 minutes they might have come out with something mildly intelligent instead of this cure for insomnia
<START> yikes br br i've seen quite a few bad movies in my days a lot of them in the company of mike tom crow and the others from mst3k so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny it wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the mst3k commentary br br the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the eighties horrible music horrible acting horrible plot what little there is horrible dialogue and really really really horrible editing cripes br br this might be called a turkey if it weren't for the fact that it's not unique in any way whatsoever it's pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director cranked out br br so try and get the mst3k version it's a pretty fun episode with mike and gang in quite good form
<START> the basic plot of boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop an american actress played by ali carter gets stuck in india worse that she is out of money she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem played by salman khan basically the movie fails at the script level just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema stands out as the best example the art direction is weak and outdated musically turns out to be a dud shankar ehsaan loy's is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear actingwise salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date ali is good and has immense screen presence performance wise too she is good br br one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http www net films php id
<START> i wish i could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment i considered seeing this movie and make other plans instead i saw a free screening of a sound of thunder so i can't complain about the price but i wish i could get my 103 minutes refunded the acting was mediocre and the special effects were deplorable people shouldn't make movies about dinosaurs if they can't afford to make the prehistoric creatures look as good or better than those in jurassic park spielberg spoiled us edward burns as travis was the movie's only saving grace i noticed that females under 18 rated the movie the highest and the only explanation is that they over burns the whole time the whole long 103 minutes this movie should have been over in about 80 minutes it just dragged on and on and on don't waste your time or your money on this far fetched flick
<START> it's been a long time since i have been in the art house theater and i went to see because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers br br the thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters br br when it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things can get better in this case not there is no real character development or interconnection between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden there's a girlfriend and then there's a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seems br br and all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it it's quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay clear from it and save your money my 50 is wasted there are better art house movies than this one br br i give three stars for the acting performance one each
