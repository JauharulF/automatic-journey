<START> this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of it's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for eachother in paris un lucky coincidences false identities the music makes it really gripping there are hardly any flaws in the characters just the end is not very credible but a definite must see still
<START> this is a film people either love it or despise it it seems me i despise it the film comes from the same context as lindsay anderson's oh lucky man but while that is a masterpiece this is just horrible br br both films take kafka's unfinished novel america for their inspiration and general ideal america is a surreal story of a youth's travels through the country kafka uses the this character as a pure observer one who does not change over the course of the journey although the book is about 300 pages and still seems only a quarter finished so we'll never know allowing kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurd surreal situations and surroundings oh lucky man follows this same template to show britain through the eyes of malcolm mcdowell and weekend does the same for france br br both films are also hugely brechtian using various tricks and techniques to point up the fact that this is not real this is etc but the difference comes where oh lucky man uses the constructed film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system weekend uses the constructed film to bludgeon us to death with ideological polemic because godard goes further than anderson in his brechtian principles we end up with two principle characters in which we have no investment at all we're forced to spend 90 minutes with them yet we couldn't care less about them deliberately so but in doing this godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message which in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and overbearing symbolism and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed to camera combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes such as the really horrible pig slaying far worse than any of the off camera violence of the car crashes br br the end result is like listening to a student political apparatchik droning on and on and on about his views whilst repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you get the message the problem with brecht is if you alienate the audience too much then you've alienated them from what you are trying to convey which always seemed self evident to me br br the parts that really stick in the for this movie though is the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the threesome at the start and the off screen comical rape in the middle which even if it could be viewed as allegorical completely destroys the film's faith in itself and it's characters what little of it existed in the first place it's so french with a capital f it hurts br br watch oh lucky man instead that is a work of genius weekend is a work of pretension br br two stars and only for the traffic jam scene and the piano scene which are just hints at genius although they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfying as without them this is a bad film by the worst most pretentious director in the world with them well it's obvious that this is a damn good technical director making the most intellectually pretentious film in the world somehow that's far worse
<START> as a ca resident i'd like to see the who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too br br i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces while they stuck to how enron rose and crashed i found it really interesting however when the movie focused on it's anti bush slant it made me wonder if they were really being accurate br br it's fine to point out any connection the republicans had to enron but the monster was created while clinton was president the ca energy crisis happened under davis's watch both were in office during abuses but neither are held accountable in any way rather many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay so what lay played golf with clinton and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom why are democrats given such a free pass in this film i think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so i'm not partial to either party but i hate feeling like i'm subject to someone's political agenda when i watch a documentary yes politicians deserve some blame but i really doubt that the only guilty one's have rs after their names i found no value in portraying the bush's as kay lovers when democrats received just as much enron campaign money as republicans did like i said it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out
<START> as has already been noted the short film every sunday 1936 could be considered the first music video this was a happy accident resulting from mgm's need to crank out a variety of short films for exhibit with its feature length material they had a couple fresh young singing talents judy garland and deanna durbin available and essentially slapped together a blend of music styles in a kind of norman rockwell concert in the park setting br br who would have dreamed at the time that they would capture the best collection of images since eisenstein's odessa steps sequence br br it's sunday with some inattentive folks sitting around a small wooden band shell in the park while a tired looking ensemble play strauss events unfold and the next sunday judy and deanna save the day the operatic deanna sings il bacio the kiss and garland follows with the contrasting waltz with a swing the climax nicely blends the two styles into a duet of americana br br a must see br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this movie is proof you can't just go to a and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try br br while i'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway decent special effects on such a low budget and at least a halfway decent script and story line unfortunately it was only just that halfway decent br br if you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up and don't mind low budget effects you might like this film honestly it wasn't really my cup of tea i should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching br br for a better science fiction movie produced on an even lower budget have a look at primer
<START> i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by the characters were very believable and entertaining and the photography was excellent the story pulled me in and held my attention i will definitely watch this again and again this true story telling at it's best not hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise basically it's a great film that received unfairly harsh reviews watch it for yourself with an open mind if you like westerns historic period pieces albeit historically inaccurate you'll enjoy the movie superb 10 10
<START> the movie heart of darkness is an insult to the book by joseph conrad to be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep on the other hand the book was definitely extraordinary i feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book in addition the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm br br the book while not an adventure story or easy to understand is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot the book though very confusing and complex is astonishing when you do finally understand it you feel as if you have actually learned something the novella or short story had several key ideas like futility and craziness which the movie left out in addition several key scenes were changed which in return affected the entire plot many of the scenes seemed to be very choppy in the sense that they did not fit together in summary the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book br br i would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book but otherwise i would skip this one it was dreadful and in complete disarray if you have never read the book then definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie the movie was a horrible spin off of an outstanding and detailed book
<START> the mario series is back and in my opinion better than ever galaxy is the most creative mario yet even more so than super mario 64 the controls are great some of the best for the wii beautiful graphical design as well the levels are very big and the good old bosses are back there is tons to explore in this game definitely a high level of replay value i only have 2 complaints 1 the story is a little to similar to mario 64 and 2 the difficulty isn't very high though it does require some patience mario fans the game you've been waiting for casual gamers this game is more than worth the buy 9 8 out of 10
<START> i consider myself a huge horror movie fan one night i wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of then i rented milo i was so surprised by this movie it scared the hell outta me that's not something i can say very often usually halloween only scares me br br two other friends watched it with me and were left with a disturbed feeling a good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie if you are unaffected then what's the point br br this movie was original it didn't follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie that's why movies like valentine bombed for me br br of course many are left with unanswered questions as most horror movies do it is worth the rent though
<START> warning spoilers br br lord knows i have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry this is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie the story involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend badly acted by otherwise great robert wagner is a murder thief and just an overall puke face after the concorde takes off he sends guided missiles to destroy the concorde so while the concorde is traveling at the speed of light our hero played with utter stupidity george kennedy opens the window in the cockpit then sticks his hand out the window to fire at the missile i'm no rocket scientist but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn then towards the final climax when the concorde is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die a passenger turns to his fiance and proposes marriage a priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing i'm not making this up wow the guy who wrote the script must have been sniffing glue for a week
<START> after seeing the aristocats special edition in a two pack with the fox in the hound i decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites br br the aristocats is a classic definitely it might not be a five star classic but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment it is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker more serious disney classics the aristocats tries to be a light hearted musical comedy and i think it just about succeeds br br the storyline doesn't really make much sense and i don't think the plot is particularly strong but it is certainly not weak the animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places typical of disney's 70s films but it does have a rustic old fashioned charm about it br br the aristocats strongest points are the characters the music and the humour the music is very memorable try getting wants to be a cat' out your head in a hurry the songs are written by the sherman brothers who also did the music for the jungle book there was one song called 'she never felt alone' that was going to be in the film but sadly didn't make it into the final feature it is a shame because i think it would have fit in very well br br the characters are unforgettable thomas is voiced by phil harris and is basically baloo in a feline form eva gabor gives duchess this warm and maternal feel and the voices actually sound like children and not an actor imitating the voice of a child the secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities edgar the butler plays a similar role to cruella de vil but he's more comical than scary often ending up in funny situations even though he's the bad guy he's still lovable all the same br br the two british geese abigail and amelia really had me cracking up along with their crazy and drunk uncle i also like the dogs who tend to argue over who is 'the leader ' i could go on but i won't spoil it but i can tell you the aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour br br the bottom line the aristocats might not be disney's crowning achievement or even their strongest film from the 70s that award is a tie between the rescuers and the many adventures of the pooh but it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain if you are looking for a dazzling work of art you might be better off watching bambi but if you want a fun night in the aristocats is the way to go it is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike enjoy and besides it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains
<START> the film was disappointing i saw it on broadway with bernadette peters and she was outstanding maybe as she herself on to the end of her musical career her of lands her in role that she flaunts re invents and as her own bette's singing is always belted always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress to be entertaining this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast so that the others would be memorable in bette's absence another criticism she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing i know it is musical theater but please leave some grace cannot perform like liza or streisand might in a retrospective tour out of character and out of context
<START> just saw the movie it's actually pretty good the left me an impression of either yet another one man show turned film Ã  la brice de nice or an expensive stupid french comedy surprisingly it's neither secret agent oss 117 is stupid but at least he sort of knows it whereas i've always found that james bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue in cheek humour that one would expect from a british rather than a french movie the women and the music are beautiful a refreshing trip into the past when the bad guys were ex nazis or soviet brutes cars were shiny and france had colonies
<START> this multi leveled thriller kept my attention throughout it is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be it is also instructive as to what past wounds can motivate present behavior no one save sandra bullock's partner is very likable however all are believable sandra did an excellent job her character cassie comes alive with all her pain and fear and defenses she is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment i enjoyed this movie very much tom landers
<START> this is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s everglades it is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half there is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing i don't know it is mesmerizing i was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime i feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule there are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool this movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its scooby doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be i couldn't take my eyes off of it and i had to ask myself why
