<START> words fail me for this appalling waste of two hours of anyone's life the story is contrived to the point of complete incredibility br br the acting is leaden and so much of this is laughably dreadful vinnie jones so wonderful in lock stock and two smoking barrels is unbearably awful and unbelievable as mike sullivan journalist br br i honestly can't ever remember seeing a worse film it's only worth watching for the appalling continuity lapses after jones is handed a huge beating he emerges without a scratch on him his girlfriend upends a drink over him and he chases her emerging from the pub bone dry it's quite dreadful made all the worse by the talented actors who appear in it
<START> maybe like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television i wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form which is exactly what 'slow is except aside from the nostalgic value the movie itself is not very good br br eric roberts plays former reporter jacob ash hired by a gerald raymond j barry a rich artist to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son brian who had been living with his mother laine beverly d'angelo for the past few years in a phillip marlowe esquire fashion jacob ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of brian but once jacob tracks down laine his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble perhaps because events in the film move too slowly there is never much suspense to this little thriller not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives br br however as said before this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then relatively unknown cast of actors which include both a very young eric roberts as well as the adorable johnny depp who plays laine's stepson donnie that may be reason enough to give it a try if you can find it
<START> this movie was so cool i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends while the first credits were rolling we saw that lionsgate films had made this movie they are the ones that made that stupid movie wolf creek which was totally gay when we saw this we groaned we thought it was going to be like wolf creek but we were so wrong the movie was not only better than wolf creek which really isn't that hard it is one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time they really redeemed themselves with this movie it was gory smart and scary which are the combinations to an awesome horror movie kane is awesome as jacob goodnight and christina vidal samantha noble and luke did pretty good jobs as part of a group of delinquents cleaning an old motel it had some gross scenes and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die all in all a great horror movie to watch on a friday or saturday night with the lights off and with friends just don't watch it in a hotel
<START> when liv ullman's character says i feel like i'm in someone else's dream and they're going to be ashamed when they wake up she is referring not only to being an unwilling player in society's war games she is referring to being an ignorant participant in life itself at the film's end when she says that she had a dream that she had a child and she was trying to take care of it but she forgot something else the implication is that she has forgotten what she has learned in the war she's just survived that like her own mother before her she will be unable to pass on any vital lessons to her own child and therefore the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continue ad infinitum
<START> bam of the jackass fame is back with his own reality show and not only is it not as funny as jackass but it's also amazingly stupider this has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb br br bam has made it big and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame bam and his parents his uncle his crew of idiotic friends all live together and while bam and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief generally his parents are at home being stupid when parents aren't at home being lazy they're being tortured by bam especially his father to add to the humor we are treated to his fat uncle don who is constantly out of it and never paying attention br br this show really is like a toned down version of jackass toned down in that there aren't stunts instead bam and his buddies just go break stuff and do lame stunts and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome this is not funny in the least i can't imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here br br if you are a big fan of bam and want to see one of the many follow up cash in sequels to the jackass series br br my rating out of 30 mins
<START> this was by far the worst movie i've ever seen and thats compared to alexander fortress 2 and the new world br br i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen i didn't think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age i was wrong while typing this message i've thought of a good reason to buy this movie a joke present at xmas i'm blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it thanks babe br br be warned a true shocker all round
<START> yes it's not a great cinematic achievement but toy soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie the young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comedic aspects of the story and i particularly liked shawn phelan as derek yogurt i've seen this one plenty of times over the years and will probably see it several more just don't think too much and you'll love it enjoy
<START> i consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies the more bizarre and imaginative the film the more blood and guts the better and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right luther starts out well enough his origin at the circus a creepy run at a supermarket an attack of an old lady and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely a hot sex shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house when luther steals the boyfriends motorbike the movie takes a turn for the worse br br the characters are presented with numerous opportunities to a save their loved ones b get the police to help c escape or most importantly d kill luther i can't feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while luther is away a policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping luther even though at one point he has a rifle squarely aimed at luther while luther and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance i found myself futilely coaching my television make sure he's dead hes gone get out of there or just kill him already br br luther is a bloodthirsty savage but he is hardly hannibal lecter if you can't outsmart this egghead you deserve what's coming to you by halfway through the movie you'll be so lethargic to the fates of the half wits that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to last to the mildly amusing ending this movie was noted as one of 101 greatest movies you've never seen well fangoria is half right in the case of luther the geek
<START> it's a great movie for the whole family i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before sophie heyman is my aunt's sister in law my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene my favorite character is hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to sophie and she got a copy from her if someone is reading this i suggest buy the movie and i guaranteed it won't be a bad decision i've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance
<START> according to most people i know that saw this film and to the reviews i've read this was supposed to be a hugely entertaining thriller that oh so needs to be seen by more people i didn't expect this film to blow me away but i certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre at best which is what it is br br i'm no stranger to french films being both french and having studied them as a student so i'm aware of the clichÃ©s and corny plot twists that can go unnoticed by english american audiences there are some great french films that should have been given widespread international release but this isn't one of them br br to begin with the plot is both far fetched over complicated and too smart assed to be entertaining so you really feel every minute of its 2hr and 5min run time and by the time everything is finally revealed you are beyond caring the main character himself is lacking any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime close to the crap ending so by the time you've even considered swallowing the main plot twists it's begun to dawn on you that you've wasted your time i actually remember switching off before the credits actually began to roll after the film's climactic reunion that was the point in which i was sure i had almost completely wasted my time by the way br br the film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated for instance i read somewhere that it beats all the bourne identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has to wall i can safely say some people are hyping up this frankly dull movie br br 4 10 is a generously considerate rating for this film i feel and since i have seen some complete and utter stinkers i'll therefore save the 1s 2s and for them
<START> crack house 1989 was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre what's supposed to be an anti drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white exploitation exercise in depravity there's nothing wrong with that however the video presentation even has an anti drug message from one of the stars of the show richard turncoat roundtree br br the movie follows two young lovers in high school one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl one of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex friends jim brown appears as the movie's mister big he's one bad dude who still can punk out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well br br if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you sadly hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do it's neither exploitative nor entertaining br br recommended for sleaze fans
<START> i am salivating for the sequels i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension anxiety what if it isn't as good and constant lack of information i needed something to calm me a little something to pass the time other than of course the matrix this was just the thing br br i found it informative like the part about keanu's neck and some of it was funny i pitied carrie anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys i found only one problem with it given that 95 of the people there were as a matter of fact male they just kinda let their mouths run wild and there was language in it it's not near as bad as the shawshank cussing runs but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day plug your ears if you are little br br it was entertaining and was just what i needed it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet they mention a tiny bit about the sequels and someone almost gives something away but he catches himself in time shoot it gives you almost no spoilers but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me br br there is no spoon
<START> fame did something odd it was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen most are based off of broadway musicals but it spawned a tv series and a broadway musical let me correct that sentence fame is not a musical musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings the singing in this music is not used to do either in fact there's no use for it at all people just randomly sing to fit in with the plot and that's not the type of musical i know br br the so called plot of fame has an onslaught of characters who are all introduced at once last time i saw that in a movie gosford park it had disastrous results who audition for and get into new york high school for the performing arts all of them are in for different reasons i e acting singing etc quote unquote drama unfolds as these middle aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years br br my largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective after all it's a free college and they can't let everyone in so how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people and why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end for no reason at all except to make us feel uncomfortable there's many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into yet you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are these relationships occur between people whose names you don't know and these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie yet you don't realize that because you don't know what they were like in the first place br br as for the singing it pops in randomly and is supposed to be humorous and does nothing when the title song is sung it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say ferris bueller everyone's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off beat to it the song itself is fine but the whole scene like the whole movie is unnecessary fame is an unpleasant movie to say the least i would say more but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head just don't see it you'll be doing yourself a favor br br my rating 2 10 br br rated r for language
<START> i think this was a horrible mistake on disney's part first off does not need to pass emperor school to become emperor that's never happened before secondly the new voices don't sound like the originals at all very poor redo and while i adored the movie the emperor's new groove the new school is just stupid like all the jokes are the same and many are from the movie the plot gets redundant always is that how you spell it trying to become empress stopping her etc or learning to become a better person i think gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions he is a spoiled brat and it bothers me i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time much less a half hour
<START> five years after she teamed up with james cagney in the public enemy mae clarke makes another appearance this time as his fiancÃ©e with cagney's character on the other side of the law it seems like she was calling more of the shots in their relationship as well trying to get johnny cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career you had to figure they'd get back together after she gave him the boot for challenging her crooked boss those things have a way of working out in pictures br br i got a kick out of watching cagney in this one i usually do and here he looked like he might have auditioned that characteristic shoulder shrug move that he used to good effect in angels with dirty faces portraying rocky sullivan it was right after he threw cavanaugh robert out of his office during the first attempt at bribing the new weights and measures boss he turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook very cool br br it's my understanding that this wasn't one of cagney's warner films but it might as well have been warner's often took up the cause for the common man and the expose of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been right up their alley you also have those great new york city street scenes depicting cars and shops of the era with home made signs pricing flour at eighteen cents a pound hey how about the furniture store selling the living room set for a hundred eighty nine dollars you might get a single stick chair for that price today br br best part of the picture just might be that meat counter scene when cagney james burke aloysius and the butchers play catch with an chicken one of the film's lighter moments but you get an idea how tense people can get when they're caught cheating same with the truck driver who's pressured by johnny into signing for an accurate delivery he just wasn't used to doing that br br all in all a nice diversion from cagney's more typical gangster presence even if not up to the standard of his feature films it's easy enough to obtain as one of a handful of public domain cagney pictures out there and often found in relatively inexpensive compilations
