<START> exquisite in simple words both sen and konkona sen seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good this might just be her best performance as an actor and best as a director yeah maybe better than mr and mrs iyer konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic shabana azmi plays the role of anjali konkona sen's elder sister shabana azmi made the best out of character for she had to play a strong responsible arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family sen has beautifully crafted character a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life her love for her family br br behavior juvenile at all for you can expect this from most of indian directors for this role looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of a schizophrenic when at times is a normal sweet college going girl she also scares you when she is shown ill both the sides have been beautifully judged and played believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in exorcist not that scary though overall marvellous piece of work by sen konkona sen and shabana azmi
<START> after reading the reviews i am so relieved to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie i am a huge nicholas sparks fan have read all of his books most of them more than once of course i loved the notebook and a walk to remember i haven't yet seen message in a bottle or nights in so i can't comment on those br br but i did go see dear john this past weekend and i was terribly upset the movie was not good at all when looking at the movie alone and not thinking about the book at all it was still a terrible movie i did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that i have got from other movies i enjoyed especially the notebook i was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared ever from the very beginning all i could notice was how they changed everything the only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named john who is in the military and a girl named savannah who is not the part about his dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book everything else was totally off first of all in the book allen was tim's little brother not his son why they had to change that i don't understand it made a lot more sense how it went in the book when tim was just a little bit older than savannah and they grew up together and allen was inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children that didn't happen in the movie ugh and in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night why did they leave those times out i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space so basically if you are a great fan of nicholas sparks don't waste your time or money on this movie just read the book again because it's terrible and nothing like the book
<START> i really loved this movie i thought it was very well done the character interaction was wonderfully done as was the characterization the actors were definitely believable the plot was very deep and intriguing even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring it's definitely worth watching several times the chemistry between the three main actors was great if you don't want to watch it for that then at least watch it for the drama between the characters i mean the whole thing was just whoa it was like i couldn't look away the whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest even through the slow parts i loved this movie and almost everything about it i loved the ending because it was so interesting and if you watch the movie a second time makes perfect sense but i'm not spoiling anything
<START> i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great but we were in for a pleasant surprise the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over br br whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons one is homely one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet the question is which one is the for him what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too when things come to an impasse a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision br br this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black n white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie
<START> i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novel br br however this in itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a text to celluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that characterize herbert's writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of paul's decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans is missing br br without prophecy what is the point of dune it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda how sad that this is all we are provided with lynch's film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film maker taking on some of the best points of lynch's film making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find heartrending
<START> erika kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems at the start of the film we see her arriving home late when her older mother protests erika goes into a frenzy attacking the older woman without pity erika as it turns out is a musical teacher of a certain renown in the conservatory where she teaches when we next see her she is the model of composure but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time and hers the same goes for the insecure anna a talented girl who erika hates maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote br br at the end of the day we watch erika as she goes into an amusement area and proceeds to one of the cabins where pornographic material is shown erika is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen on another occasion erika comes to a drive in where a movie is in progress her attention goes toward a parked car in which two lovers are performing a sex act the camera lingers on erika as she is lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing until she is surprised by the young man inside the car erika flees horrified she's been discovered br br when a wealthy couple invites erika to perform in a recital in their opulent home she meets an eager young man walter who is related to the hosts walter is immediately taken with erika's playing the young man is a talented pianist himself his eagerness to compliment erika is met with skepticism on her part walter decides to audition for erika's master class and is accepted br br thus begins walter pursuit of erika who is taken aback when she realizes what the young man's motives really are in turn erika begins to fantasize about walter in ways that only her mind could imagining what she would like him do when and if they get together walter gets turned off by the letter erika has written to him detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man br br the film's ending reminded us of the last sequence of mr haneke's current cache we are taken to a concert hall where erika is going to perform she is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of walter who goes on into the hall without noticing her erika's expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film as she flees the lobby area after inflicting a wound on herself the camera abandons her and concentrates on the building's facade that seems to stay on the screen for a long time br br la pianiste is a personal triumph for isabelle huppert this magnificent actress does one of her best appearances on the screen guided by the sure hand of michael haneke one of the most interesting directors working today ms huppert's works with economic gestures yet she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her erika br br the supporting cast does wonders under the director's guidance annie girardot always excellent is perfect as erika's mother she seems to be the key of whatever went wrong with her daughter there is a hint of incest that is played with subtleness in the context of the film benoit is perfectly cast as walter this young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man so in love with a woman that is possessed by demons that he'll never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal manner br br michael haneke films are always disturbing to watch yet they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men don't the magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by schubert and two composers that are erika's own favorites the movie is helped tremendously by christian cinematography
<START> this movie sucked sooo bad i couldn't even watch the ending milo's voice was too low and i couldn't understand what he said as well as some of lines also where did he get all these wedding dresses from it was very impractical the movie failed to elaborate on milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule dr jeter and his practice overall i was disappointed that i was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one i felt i was giving it undeserved praise
<START> okay to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film if you can't then you'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower charlie chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code unknown to each other they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects apparently plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away okay remember i said to ignore this right okay well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse okay now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises the film gets really really good br br charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive so because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date but they both sneak back home not wanting their spouses to know anyway they meet later and are quite attracted to each other but what about the poor spouses supposedly at home well they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other late in the film charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby it really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person you really have to see it to believe it however the wife sees an ad with charlie's before and after photos and knows what's happening in the end they both feel pretty foolish
<START> follows a documentary filmmaker kobayashi as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby's cries coming from the house next door where there is no baby kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor he's greeted with hostility by the unhinged disheveled woman maria who answers the door and promptly slams it in his face and gets a peek at her 6 year old son through a window strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that this interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic well known 10 year old clairvoyant and tv celebrity kana rio kanno seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help another female psychic actress matsumoto becomes involved as does mr a mentally unstable kook psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to worms clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as br br unlike many other hand held horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first person scares thankfully there's something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it doesn't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera work every once in awhile to keep your interest the way travels around following leads in search of the truth with well placed jolts along the way reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing the film also doesn't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the footage either overall it's a well made horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments that's well worth checking out my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long otherwise pretty good stuff
<START> brilliant actors and brilliant picture i love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just so touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic the vietnam war was far from human and i believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances modern war movies are spending so much money on effects this is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination a movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in and fate how insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion a must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this
<START> for me it just didn't seem like gi joe at all when i watched it as a kid i just didn't care for it in fact the part i liked best about this one was the opening credits they change so many facts around and turn the story around as well cobra commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in antarctica or somewhere that is frozen though i always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here there is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie but for me it just ruins what i watched the series for in the first place
<START> there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on this one is br br after some years of fantasy role playing we split me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become a dork br br you see these things are really canonical it happens to everybody br br first you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack br br then you help a little with the constitution and while you're at it why not help with strength intelligence intuition charisma and dexterity too this in turn frustrates the game master who doesn't know how to deal with this invincible gang and after a while it bores the players too so they start to create ever more exotic race profession combinations no matter how ludicrous it is br br i created a warrior monk yeah not that far from the film br br and that's not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game think the hunt for experience points but just watch the film it shows it all and of course the stupidity of its most basic br br for this end in turn there is no better profession than the bard i don't exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place after all the blacksmith is none but once it became one it had to be mapped into the game flow that is it had to be made lethal at least indirectly the poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so br br sure it's not exactly a professional production but i haven't seen a better satire in ages
<START> this film is just really great i don't know why i alway have a weakness for damian it's not scarface but still i really enjoyed my self this is a film i can see more than ten times he really try's to make a good movie but he just can't do it i feel pity for him so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote i can't help it but i just can't give it less than 9 stars everyone should have seen this once in his life to see how to make a cheap film work i live in holland and bought this film for only one euro that's 1 50 dollar i would have also bought it for ten euro great great great on a little dutch film site this film gets a 101 votes here only a 260 that's not so much more so people all over the world buy this movie
<START> having first read the novel i don't mind for the purposes of filming how differently it is scripted as long as it adheres to or at least includes the plot for reasons known only to hollywood important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story line added the reason this novel passed the test of time is no doubt due to the interweaving of both the characters and plot as a whole to interfere with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line and therefore the intension of the story teller although a matter of opinion the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired characters described as very fat should at least be made to look portly to allow for the character to have credibility the days of slavery can't be over or surely actors of this calibre would have been in revolt at such a travesty of the story the face of marian is described as being manly in appearance tara fitzgerald's very feminine appearance doesn't ring true again laura fairly is described as being if not so with dark hair she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel badly done hollywood br br j hunter
<START> this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from the movie i think i saw a half naked indian in my room last night response that was no hallucination it was a indian in your room and another is what the hell are you talking about just what the hell are you talking about but if i ever be admitted to an hospital like this one i will be prepared to write my will on the spot i would say there were in my opinion three very funny characters in this film most funny but three is the funniest to me even though their lines were few and don't get me started on the crack pot patient hehehe that one i will keep secret and fast paced too
